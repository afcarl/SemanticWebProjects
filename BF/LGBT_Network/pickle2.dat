S"We do not want to put our children in harms way. View this image  North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory, a backer of the anti-LGBT law passed in March. AP / Chuck Burton Reacting to North Carolinas new law that strips LGBT protections and targets transgender people for discrimination, an LGBT family group is canceling its summer gathering in the state, saying the antagonistic environment raises safety concerns. Given the hostile climate under this new law, we could not guarantee the safety of our families as they traveled to and from our event, Emily Hecht-McGowan, a leader of the Family Equality Council, said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. In advocating for and defending the law, Republican lawmakers and Gov. Pat McCrory have consistently argued transgender women whom they called men are sex predators who prey in public restrooms. They said the law was necessary to protect women and girls. With that discussion dominating state politics, leaders of the Family Equality Council worried about the 25 families, including many from out of state, scheduled to attend the event outside Hendersonville. We do not want to put our children in harms way, Hecht-McGowan said. We are committed to serving our families in the South, but we also need to be reasonably confident that we dont put their safety, security and dignity at risk. Although officials have claimed transgender people pose a safety threat in restrooms, there is no evidence of such problems in 17 states and 225 cities with nondiscrimination protections for LGBT people. House Bill 2 stripped local jurisdictions in North Carolina of LGBT nondiscrimination protections and banned transgender people from restrooms that match their gender in government-run facilities. A federal lawsuit argues the states law is unconstitutional, because it targets LGBT people for disparate treatment. Corporations have mounted a backlash, including PayPal, which canceled a planned expansion of 400 employees in the state. Family Weekend in the South is among many of the Family Equality Councils events for parents who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and for their children. The June gathering was to be the groups inaugural event in North Carolina, modeled after Family Weekend in the Midwest, Gay Days at Anaheim, and Family Week in Ptown. Brent Wright, another organization leader, explained in a statement to BuzzFeed News, We are committed to serving our families in the South, but given the situation in North Carolina, this is just not the right place for our families at this time.

aS"In 2016, the mainstream looks and sounds like this boundary-pushing Canadian sister act. Now that the former outsiders have survived misogynist critics, a fickle industry, and each other, the stars are aligned for them to become two of the biggest names in pop. In a city of beige sheds in Burbank, north of Los Angeles, the SirReel Studios live up to their name when Tegan and Sara Quin appear fresh out of makeup, the mirror image of each other, even more so than usual. Fans can usually tell the 35-year-old Canadian identical twins apart: Sara has a heart-shaped face, and Tegan has a little scar from her old labret piercing. Their friends compare anxious Sara to a cat, and breezy Tegan to a dog. In a cab two days prior, Sara and I sat in the back talking about her relationships, while upfront Tegan thrashed to the drivers alt-90s playlist, routinely turning to ask if we were even listening: Guys, Hole! But on this stiflingly hot day in late February, theyre styled to eradicate any differences. Pretty weird, huh? says Tegan. They both have slicked-back hair, whited-out lips, and bleached eyebrows to shoot footage for Boyfriend, the lead single from their forthcoming eighth album, Love You to Death, that will be part of their live show. Each of the records 10 songs will have its own clip, ranging from a DIY video with an Instagram-famous dog groomer (piano ballad 100x) to this big-budget affair. On a table are clay busts of Saras face, which she sat for a few days ago. It was traumatic. The molding material covered everything but her nose, which made her panic. She says she and her girlfriend of five years, Stacy Reader, arent affectionate by nature, so she knew it was bad when Reader started squeezing her hand and reassuring her using her pet name, Squin. Tegans phone contains several close-up shots of her sisters putty-clad nostrils. Its a perk of sharing a face that only one twin had to do it. View this image  Elizabeth Weinberg for BuzzFeed News. Sara wears a black leather Day Birger et Mikkelsen shirt. Boyfriend is one of Saras songs, and it sounds like a right-to-reply from the silent partners of I Kissed a Girl or Demi Lovatos Cool for the Summer. I let you take advantage cause it felt so good / I blame myself for thinking we both understood, Sara sings seductively, before bursting into an anxious, sing-songy ultimatum: You call me up like you would your best friend / You turn me on, like you would your boyfriend / But I dont wanna be your secret anymore. She didnt intend it as a kiss-off. She was writing in part about Reader seeing a guy when they first met, and more broadly about gender identity and roles in all relationships, which inspired the videos fluid, drag-inspired aesthetic: The Quins take turns getting gaudy makeup applied, and a giant motion-capture camera films them in close-up, miming along to the ridiculously catchy track. In the final, CGI-enhanced edit, the colors will swim across their faces. Sara says shes ready for such an obviously queer pop song (she notes it name-checks The Crying Game) to strike a mainstream chord. The idea of a guy being like, I totally relate to Boyfriend, girls are always playing these games with me, and Im like, I know, she says with an emphatic groan. I think theres a part of me that wishes I lived in a world where it was like that. Fans wont see this footage until the Love You to Death world tour, for which Sara has massive ambitions. Right now, theyre booked to play 4,000-capacity venues in major U.S. markets, but, she asks out loud: By 2017 can we be one of the top headlining tours in the States or internationally? Can we be one of the top-billed artists at festivals in 2017? I would love to be up there with our peers, Arcade Fire or Vampire Weekend. Maybe we can reach enough people that we can sell out a Madison Square Garden or an O2 Arena at some point. I want to believe that. Tegan and Saras last album, 2013s Heartthrob, turned them from cult indie artists to actual pop stars, seven records into their career. It took a little convincing: The records predecessor, 2009s disjointed Sainthood, sounded like the work of a group that had fallen out of sync, but their then-label head told them there was massive mainstream radio potential in their new demos. (Hed worked with Kid Rock, and used the enjoyably inappropriate example of All Summer Long to show how an alternative artist could shift to the mainstream.) He challenged them about assuming there was a ceiling over their potential reach. I was like, Well there is, quite literally, says Tegan. I cant think of a gay woman thats on the pop charts. And they were like, Well why cant that be you? View this image  Elizabeth Weinberg for BuzzFeed News. Tegan wears a shirt by ICB. They swept pop radio. The album went top three in the U.S. and Canada, Closer became their first top 20 single, and they won Junos (the Canadian Grammy) for Single, Group, and Pop Album of 2014. They performed the song with Taylor Swift on the Red tour in August 2013 (she baked them biscuits and jam), supported Katy Perry on the Prismatic Tour the following year, and reached millions more people when they sang Everything Is Awesome for The Lego Movie. But this time around, they want to be the main event. Pop feels a bit like an arms race at the moment (see: Taylor Swifts Bad Blood video) with power concentrated among a small few. You rarely hear established acts let alone indie acts speaking so honestly about their desire to muscle their way to the top. And even if more artists did, pop rarely works that way. Tegan and Sara are low-key stars, and have no intentions of becoming Olympians, as Sara admiringly describes Swift and company. But for them to demand more feels not only radical, but actually possible, and not only because Love You to Death is their strongest, catchiest record to date. After years of butting up against the indie press poking fun at their sexuality and sisterhood, the Quins have found acceptance in the modern pop world, where strong, nontraditional personalities are in no short supply. As artists like Years and Years, Willow Smith, Halsey, Troye Sivan, and Frank Ocean have proven, gender and sexual fluidity is no longer seen as a limitation. At least at surface level, pop is as interested in social justice as the sisters have always been. And the once-unusual online fandom that the twins have stoked for over a decade (their fans labeled themselves Tees or Esses) has become a cultural norm. Though some devotees, first drawn to the twins because they were outsiders, kicked back at their mainstream makeover: Who even are you guys any more? asked one fan when they announced they were opening for Katy Perry. They missed the point: Pop finally allowed Tegan and Sara to be themselves without apology. The stars are aligned to get them where they want to go professionally, which is only possible because the Quins are closer than theyve ever been. The sisters infighting and comic onstage bickering are part of the bands lore, but the fact that they can now collaborate and manage each others anxieties finally makes them a proper united front at this pivotal moment. They have always joked that if they had been born as one person, they would be terrifyingly powerful, but Sara had always resisted that kind of association. Before we were even in a band I was filled with self-doubt about what I actually had to offer people besides looking like Tegan, says Sara. Ive always carried that in our band and in our relationship. And so what if I just let go, and let Tegan have influence on what I do, and she lets me have influence on what she does? We finally get to become the superhuman, says Tegan. View this image  Tegan (left) Sara (right) photographed in Los Angeles on March 18. Elizabeth Weinberg for BuzzFeed News. Styling: Turner / The Wall Group. Hair: David Gardner / GRID Agency. Makeup: Garret Gervais / GRID Agency. In a fancy bar atop the Pershing Square Building in Downtown L.A., the Quins are squinting at JPEGs on Tegans phone, figuring out last-minute changes for the lyric insert for the Love You to Death vinyl. I like the way it looks as LYTD, says Sara. I understand that, says Tegan. Love You to Death looks like that movie Thats the name of the record so lets not implant weird associations. that movie Because its vinyl we can get away with it we should put the whole name. Tegan and Sara have been a major label band for almost a decade, but still act like a DIY cottage industry, particularly when it comes to merchandise. They obsess over other bands stores so that they can give thorough plans to their label, Warner Bros., which Tegan describes as the puppy thats sitting outside waiting to be let in. Working with their creative director (and Saras ex-wife) Emy Storey, they cater to fans who treat them like a lifestyle, selling Tegan and Sara pencils, pillows, gym bags, journals, calendars, and mugs. For Christmas 2014, they made an ornament. Even Saras Scottish Fold cats, Mickey and Holiday, the real stars of the twins Instagram, have their own merch line: enamel pins and a set of cookie cutters in the shape of their faces. There was a long period of time where I think that what we were doing did feel very revolutionary, says Sara. And now it feels very par for the course. View this image  As queer women in an industry still largely ruled by straight, white men, theyve always felt compelled to hold on to their business. We didnt wanna relinquish control and say, yep, youre right, were just manufactured by the old label, says Sara. Over lunch at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art earlier that afternoon, she makes clear that they dont think of the way they approach their work as any kind of edict for other bands. As weve gotten bigger and had more resources and access to these departments, were just like, Oh, this is so fun should we just run the record label? Sara and I consider ourselves efficiency experts, says Tegan. We feel wed be really good at everything, and then show people a better and more efficient way to do it. Saras dream is to turn around the U.S. Post Office, which she finds so upsettingly disorganized, shes discussed it with her therapist. Playing with a necklace she borrowed from her sister (and will later accidentally break), she relates it back to how she and Tegan approach their work. We never let up. Nothing can ever just be OK. Were really controlling. We love being bosses, we love being leaders. View this image  Courtesy Tegan and Sara (4) The instinct started early. The Quins grew up in a lower-middle-class, racially mixed part of northeast Calgary. Their parents divorced when they were 5. When they spent weekends at their dads one-bedroom apartment, he took the couch while the girls shared his bed. At dinnertime, he would spin a globe and make them name the capital of whatever country their finger landed on. If they guessed right, they went to McDonalds. If not, they ate whatever was in the fridge. Well, that was the joke, says Tegan. There was nothing in the fridge. As teenagers, they were high-achieving burnouts, who drank, smoked pot, and dropped acid during the school day (never together, so that they could babysit each other through the trips), but volunteered and studied classical piano. On the weekends, they would get into circle pits when bands like NOFX came through town. They picked up the guitar at age 15, and started writing together as Plunk, using the school photocopier to print the artwork for their cassettes. They first attracted Canadian industry interest after winning a college battle of the bands (Garage Warz) while they were still in high school. It made the 17-year-old punks suspicious. Their mom, Sonia, who worked with at-risk teenage girls, told them to wait a year before signing anything, and when her only kids told her they were skipping college to pursue music, she made them take it seriously, driving them to coffee shops to hand out tapes and rsums. They held up their end of the bargain: They never touched drugs again, and never drank on the job. It was a tough first year, says Tegan. Eventually, Universal Canada paid for them to make a demo. They got three tapes out of it sought-after rarities Yellow Tape, Red Tape, and Orange Tape but no deal. Still, the girls approached the producer about recording an independent debut album. We had faith that if we made a record, Tegan says, putting on a dramatic voice, They would come. They asked their grandfather, who had raised himself up from poverty through farming and remained incredibly frugal, for a loan of $10,000 CAD. In April 1999, producer Jared Kuemper and the 18-year-old Quins set up a recording studio in Sonias crystal-strewn living room, and made Under Feet Like Ours. Its a time capsule that makes their love of Ani DiFranco obvious: crunchy guitars, angsty lyrics, husky over-enunciation, though their message is clear. Freedoms rough / So we take our stand and fight for tomorrow, they sing on Proud, while Divided recounts their mom sending them to a therapist during a particularly rough patch. View this image  A year later, Vapor Records, the label founded by Neil Young and his longtime manager Elliott Roberts, signed the band on the spot. Both sisters were already out, and Vapor encouraged them to be open about their sexuality, believing that they could become the voice of a generation. The climate when they started was not as it is today, says Roberts. They were very brave, and there was never any bones about what they felt or what they thought. The first album was mostly re-recorded for their Vapor debut, 2000s This Business of Art, which had a few new tracks. They were all but unknown when they performed a growly rendition of My Number on the Late Show With David Letterman, Tegan wearing a Tim Hortons T-shirt. That summer, they were invited to support Neil Young and the Pretenders in America, and studied the machinations of a well-run show. Neil has his whole family on tour, Sara says. It felt like family. I remember thinking, This feels normal. They put the lessons into practice. A second loan from their grandpa, for $20,000, covered CDs and T-shirts for their first Canadian tour, which they mounted via Greyhound bus in 2001. They ran a tight ship, maintaining a show binder, a merch binder, and a logistics binder. After each show, one twin kept watch as the other fed dollar bills into ATMs. By the end of the tour, they had made $6,000 apiece, and put another $6,000 in the company pot. Their familys financial conscientiousness had translated into serious business acumen. When we got to Calgary, our grandpa said, You gonna put a down payment on your loan? says Tegan. We said, No, heres the money. Everyone felt so much pride. When the Quins secured the New Pornographers John Collins and veteran Vancouver-based producer David Carswell to help their next album, 2002s mostly acoustic pop-punk If It Was You, they offered the men contracts, because they wanted them to get royalties one day. This was a level of professionalism foreign even to established musicians a decade or so their senior. We were still really stupid about the business end of it, says Collins. Those two young ladies were completely operating on another level. View this image  Elizabeth Weinberg for BuzzFeed News. Tegan (left) Sara (right): Tegan wears Unif jacket and sweater, ALC shirt, Loft pants, and Kurt Geiger sneakers. Sara wears Laer jacket, Saint Laurent pants, and Kurt Keiger shoes. Its a cool L.A. afternoon in late February, and Tegan has flown to Vancouver to move into her new apartment. Sara and girlfriend Reader will follow later today to buy furniture for theirs. The sisters lived on opposite coasts for over a decade, but just bought condos three blocks apart in downtown Vancouver so close you can see Tegans place from the courtyard of Saras building. They both rent in L.A. while theyre working, like now: The washer-dryer in the kitchen of Sara and Readers Silverlake home is whirring with one last pre-flight laundry load. A friend will cat-sit when theyre gone. Right now, gray, placid Holiday is nowhere to be seen. Mickey, the weirder black-and-white sibling, spends the next three hours staring out of the kitchen window, or lying spread-eagle on the rug. Sara gets two seltzers out of the fridge, which is plastered with postcards and photos showing the couple smiling at a recent family wedding. Reader moved from the East Coast to live with Sara, and wasnt as worried about leaving behind her friends and job as she was the prospect of the Quins living in the same city. You guys are doing so well and you have such an established thing in your world do you think you can really do that? Sara recalls Reader saying. I was like, Well, were about to find out. Love You to Death is the first time Sara has written about the darkest era of her relationship with Tegan, which almost broke up the band just as they were first making commercial and critical headway. It was cruel of me to do what I did to you, she sings on ballad 100x. White Knuckles is gothic-tinged synth-pop. I made us feel unlucky too, she sings, stretching each word. So, luck be damned / Break that mirror in two. View this image  Elizabeth Weinberg for BuzzFeed News The hurt set in when Sara left for the East Coast at age 23. Vancouver was too expensive, and she needed to escape her burgeoning twin identity crisis. Weeks after moving to Montreal she met Storey, who introduced her to the citys activism scene and became her long-term girlfriend. She was also the first person who intervened when the sisters fought, a role that even their parents had avoided. I sometimes so desperately wanted someone to just say which one of us was right and which one of us was wrong, says Sara, pulling at her laundry-day T-shirt. When Sara returned to Vancouver to record 2004s synth-adorned So Jealous, the sisters went into therapy. On tour they shared hotel rooms, where they would wrestle after shows. They also fought in front of their crew. As women, weve also had to carry the burden that men are allowed to kick shit and punch each other, she says. It was completely horrifying to people that we would fight. By the time they made 2007s rocky, experimental The Con, they had been upstreamed from Vapor to major label Warner Bros. The tour was grueling. They were grieving for their grandmother, who had practically raised them, and Sara for her relationship. She and Storey had married in a civil ceremony just the two of them, signing papers before a notary so that the New Yorkborn designer could get Canadian citizenship, which Sara detailed in The Cons sweet, contemplative opener, I Was Married. But by the time the Quins toured Europe in 2008, the couple had separated, and I was totally alone for the first time in a long time, says Sara briskly as James Blakes Limit to Your Love plays from her stereo. She speaks with such intensity that she rarely lingers on the emotional details. That freezing tour, they got in three bus accidents. In Glasgow, on February 29, the sisters properly came to blows. View this image  Elizabeth Weinberg for BuzzFeed News That was rock bottom, says Sara. That was screaming, fighting, pushing, punching: Bands done. I feel ashamed of how badly Tegan and I treated each other. We were totally without the tools to get through what was happening to us. They canceled a string of shows. Their managers freaked out, until Neil Young stepped in. Sara recalls him saying: Who cares? Just fucking cancel everything. Whats more important: their relationship or doing Glastonbury? I remember my therapist and people around me being like, Has it ever occurred to you that youre just tired? That you need a break for a minute? Like, Wow, how did we get so far apart from each other? I remember in between The Con and Sainthood really deciding that my relationship with Tegan as a sister was far more important than the one in a band. Love You to Death is the first album where Saras felt comfortable writing about her struggles with her sister. In the years where I wasnt secure in our relationship, I knew that was the one completely untouchable topic, she says, speaking rapidly. I have left Tegan as a very protected thing the only protected thing and I think its because I was most afraid of it. Now that were good again and things are so strong between us, its really much safer for me to start to analyze it. View this image  Elizabeth Weinberg for BuzzFeed News. Tegan (right) wears Booker jacket, stylist's own T-shirt, Loft pants, and LD Tuttle shoes. Sara (left) wears Isabel Marant Etoile blazer, Greylin shirt, Agathe pants (available at Satine LA), Kurt Geiger shoes, and Ch Two days later, Tegan opens the door to her Vancouver apartment, which shes just moved into after seven months of renovations. Its striking: all bright white and exposed concrete, and floor-to-ceiling windows spanning both stories. Her future studio is full of boxes and trinkets: Their grandpa died last year, and each twin inherited one of the vintage slot machines he refurbished as a hobby, and the beer signs from their grandparents basement bar, where the couple would dance to country music and host bands. Theres a trophy Storey made the sisters for not fighting during a 2011 tour, two bronze football players atop a plaque that reads Tegan and Sara Get Along. Tegan turns on the electric fireplace, and settles at one end of her couch. The place is so new that she hasnt had time to buy basic appliances shes still sharing a vacuum with Sara that they trade back and forth. Spare planks of wood from the renovation serve as a makeshift coffee table. If theres one thing they wont be doing on the Love You to Death campaign, its eagerly traipsing around radio stations in the hope of getting playlisted, a rigmarole that sent them spiraling last time around. [You have to] wake up and go to a radio station and talk to a bunch of people named like, Daryl the Dog and Sharkman, and theyre gonna ask two questions that arent relevant to our project, honk some horn, and then were done for the day, Tegan recalls. Im like, Should we spend $2,000 flying here? Then it opens a can of worms: Have we lost our integrity, was this worth it, what is pop music, is this working? Compounding the stress, their beloved aunt Julie, who had toured the world with them early on, also died mid-tour. The intensity of their lives meant that the sisters closed ranks to make their eighth record, the process as insular as it was on their debut. Greg Kurstin, who rarely works on full albums, produced eight of Heartthrobs 10 songs, and came on board for the whole of Love You to Death. Working with Tegan and Sara, it just feels so effortless, says Kurstin, whos also worked with dozens of A-listers like Adele, Taylor Swift, Sia. Its one of the few bands that I would wanna do a whole album with. View this image  As the new Lucius record plays from her laptop, Tegan says they wanted to write a very introverted album because she knew the scale that theyre operating now could sacrifice the intimacy theyve always had with their fans. Thats not to say it sounds insular theyve pushed Heartthrobs synth-pop palette into harder, leaner bangers. For her, Love You to Death is about how debilitating and transformative relationships can be, which includes Sara, though her identity is less contingent on her sisters than vice versa. Tegans dating again after having had two long-term girlfriends back-to-back. (Sara calls her a serial monogamist, who, if left single, might die her organs might not work.) Last year, she realized that too many of her relationships had been about compromise, and that she hadnt been pulling her weight. It set her on a course of self-improvement she mimes tearing and preening at herself with the exaggerated movements of the lead in a Sia video. Love You to Death starts with That Girl, which flickers and pounds as she asks, When did I fall so far? Barely recognize me. But over the course of her five songs, she comes to accept her whims. Theres a point where you have to be like, This is me, and youre either charmed or not, she says with a wry grin. I want to feel comfortable with who I am, still work on myself, but not constantly tear myself down, either. Tegan is more confident than her sister, though Saras anxiety can mean that she becomes the dominant one. Sara has this awful, anxious time feeling like an outsider, and its so funny, Tegan says, sounding incredulous. Like, Well you act like an outsider! I just act like I belong everywhere I am, and I dont have those fears, and yet when I am with Sara, sometimes I feel like an outsider for sure. View this image  Elizabeth Weinberg for BuzzFeed News I remember being in the back of the van, and Sara being in the front, ranting about Stereogum, bands from Montreal, she continues, reflecting on the tour for 2004s So Jealous. Sara desperately wanted the band to be accepted by the indie rock elite and the press, despite the abject sexism and homophobia they experienced from the latter: Pitchfork said they could once be mistaken for tampon rock, Spin, a Wicca-folk nightmare; radio hosts would ask them live on air if they were incestuous with each other; and NME declared that they were quite lovely, even if they do hate cock. Id be sitting in the back, staring out the window like, Arent we cool? I thought we were so cool. She was like, We are not cool, says Tegan. When Sara was anguishing over being accepted by the likes of Arcade Fire, Tegan had found a home in the pop-punk community, befriending bands like AFI, New Found Glory, Against Me!, and Paramore. I loved the openness, she says. I had felt a little bit like an outsider but not of one specific group were on tour all the time, were outsiders, period. Hayley Williams said Paramore had been looking for an important band to support them on their 2010 outdoor arena tour. The sisters fit the bill. They dont need to keep pushing themselves but they do, Williams says. And their name means something. Not only because they stand for something, but because they play original songs that they write from their heart. Tegan and Sara are authentic in an industry that sometimes seems to be made up of irony. On tour with Paramore, Tegan spotted a change in her sister. Just to be embraced by those fans, she realized we werent as outsidery as she thought we were. Definitely I saw her confidence growing, and her interest in pop and electronic music also became really important, and became an asset. Tegan agrees that her and Saras relationship is probably the best its ever been. What weve accomplished is so astronomical compared to what most people have to do, she says. We have to work together, we have to share a face, an identity, we have to sleep next to one another on a bus its incredible. So the fact that we even enjoy each other is a miracle. Were lucky that I still hear Saras music and think that shes a genius, shes amazing, that shes interesting and she can say things in a way that I could never. View this image  Tegan (left) Sara (right). Elizabeth Weinberg for BuzzFeed News In a fancy Japanese restaurant in downtown Vancouver, the Quins spend 20 minutes respectfully arguing about their individual approaches to activism now a prerequisite for the modern pop star, but a lifelong concern for the sisters. The week before, a judge denied Kesha the preliminary injunction that would free her from her contract with Dr. Lukes label. (A judge formally dismissed the case April 6.) As many artists did, Sara tweeted #freekesha from the bands account. The upshot of their very nuanced debate is that Tegan would rather take action by going straight to the source a charity, the person at the center of the issue rather than post on Twitter or Instagram. I dont feel better when we post about something thats controversial, she says. It actually makes me feel like we think we got away with being supportive about something. Sara posted about Kesha without ever talking to me, but obviously I would support it. Sara also gets involved behind the scenes, but thinks speaking out alongside her peers is important. When I see Bethany [Cosentino] from Best Coast, and Lena [Dunham], and Justin Bieber tweeting about Kesha, my impulse is to go, This is fucking outrageous, Im gonna fucking say something. She worries that if they didnt join in, fans would accuse them of being vapid. Over their 17-year-career, Tegan and Sara have consistently stood up to be counted, especially on LGBT issues. Theyve also quietly benefitted a range of charities, mostly pertaining to marginalized groups. Theyve just signed up as board members of the Girls Rock Camp Foundation, and want to show teenage girls how to get into their world. Sara had a great idea about touring high schools and talking to them about self-esteem and music, says Tegan. They are completely authentic and honest, says Cyndi Lauper, who in 2007 invited them on her True Colors tour, which benefits LGBT organizations. They show that you can be yourself, stay on your path, not sell out, and fans will be drawn to that. As out queer women, theyve always been natural activists, though it started with their mom. Sonia went back to college when the girls were young, and brought home lessons about prejudice and advocacy, which spurred them into action when their school banned baggy pants to try to combat local gang culture. Our mother told us, This is fucking fascist, and so what were gonna do is sign a petition and were gonna do a sit-in and change the infrastructure, says Sara. They gathered 30 kids and assembled outside the school office to discuss censorship. Our mom instilled that in us really young. We should understand what we care about and we should participate and support the people that we do care about. Tegans reticence to get on the internet soapbox also stems from anxiety about how their fanbase reacts. Certain factions find fault with everything they do. The Quins caught onto the value of online fandoms earlier than most bands, following their fans lead. Jennifer Vaughn taught herself HTML to start the first Tegan and Sara fan site in 2000, when she was 24, after she heard This Business of Art but couldnt find much background on them. Within a month, the first of many online T&S communities had formed around it. (The band started their own site two years later.) She met her wife through the board they just celebrated their 10-year anniversary, and have two kids. These sites were how you found them before Twitter endorsements from Katy Perry and performances at the Oscars: You discovered one queer bands online message board, asked for tips of other artists to listen to, found Tegan and Sara, and signed up to their forum asking if it was normal to listen to My Number while thinking of your female gym teacher, only for the older board members to reassure you that was the most textbook baby-queer move ever. The sisters fed the culture that their fans had started, sharing reading lists, tour diaries, and behind-the-scenes footage before most people had an internet connection fast enough to watch it. View this image  Elizabeth Weinberg for BuzzFeed News These days, the Quins have a fan club, the Superclose Society, which offers exclusive merch and official membership cards, and is generous with photos and insights into the womens lives. The implied intimacy can lead some of their fans to overzealous criticism. If they support a cause, its the wrong one. Sara posts a picture of the cats, they want a selfie; we post a selfie, they think were douchebags; I wear a pleather jacket, Im a seal hunter, Tegan sing-songs, looking weary at the thought. Its the catch-22 of being role models for a marginalized identity: The pressure from fans not to mess up is even higher, though responses like these seem more self-defeating, or self-serving, than genuine attempts to hold the Quins accountable for any serious wrongdoing. I see so many messages: what about #blacklivesmatter, what about #oscarssowhite, she continues. If you speak up on one topic, everyone expects you to speak on every topic. I do believe that a lot of people listen to us to hear about what music we listen to, and what books we read, and what we believe politically, but its a very, very fine line for me. Im always careful about the balance because I dont want to be a political commentator. Im not educated in that, and I am always nervous to talk on any topic outside of music because I dont wanna be one of those people that just speaks emotionally but doesnt have the context to support it. View this image  But Twitter does give them useful recourse that they didnt have a decade ago: In the run-up to the Academy Awards, the weekend were in Vancouver, Rolling Stone listed the Quins 2015 rendition of Everything Is Awesome as the fifth best Oscars musical performance ever, describing them as the Canadian lesbian duo who had performed with the Lonely Island. Sara tweeted back: lesbian Canadian duo @teganandsara is honored to be included w/heterosexual trio @thelonelyisland. Rolling Stone took it down straight away, and apologized. No more Mr. Nice Guy with that kind of thing, Sara says. Theyre thinking of making a T-shirt that has every homophobic, sexist thing ever written about them emblazoned on it, to show how far society has come, and all that theyve weathered. We refuse to feel ashamed, says Tegan. Cause we felt ashamed then and we dont anymore. Now we wear it as a badge of honor we lived through a time where you could talk that way about women. At this point it feels like theyve made such inroads, or that its so normalized in a great way, says Against Me!s Laura Jane Grace, who wrote the song Borne on the FM Waves of the Heart for Tegan to sing on in 2007. Theyre Tegan and Sara, theyre great, theyre lesbians, who fucking cares? Theyre twins, who cares? Theyre just a really great band. With certain battles won, they can also relax and live their truth. One of Love You to Deaths most striking songs is BWU. Sara sings: Save your first and last dance for me / I dont need a white wedding. Shes never believed in forever, but she couldnt have written BWU before gay marriage was legalized in America last summer. I really felt it was important for me and Tegan to be on the forefront of that movement, she says. But as soon as it happened, I felt relieved. Not because suddenly we were all getting married I was like, finally, I can just say what I really think, which is that now everybody has it, lets start dismantling this shit. View this image  Elizabeth Weinberg for BuzzFeed News Their influence has borne out. Jack Antonoff of fun. and Bleachers regularly collaborates with Sara, and is one of Taylor Swifts and Sias go-to songwriting partners. You would go into the studio with an artist and youd be like, What are you into lately? he says. And theyd be like, Heartthrob. What kinda vibe do you wanna do? Heartthrob. They still want to widen their scope. Theyre writing for other artists, like Carly Rae Jepsen, but wont settle for being anyones opening act this time around. Saras just written the score for Clea Duvalls new movie, The Intervention, and wants to campaign on the minuscule number of women in film scoring. Tegan wants to push into other formats like podcasts and embrace the financial necessity of branding. Being a musician doesnt just mean being a musician anymore, she says. And I think that for Sara and I, its actually taken some of the pressure off. She just spent the last three months rewriting the demos for songs they didnt use to give to their publisher, to see if other artists will record them. I still feel like theres so much more to say. But maybe well find other ways to say it, not just through music. The check arrives. Amid empty wine glasses and a bowl of decimated pork belly, talk turns to the future. They renewed their deal with Warner Bros. for three records, Love You to Death being the first, even though theyre both aware that whole albums, and the music business infrastructure that creates and sells them, may hold little sway as playlists and singles come to dominate. But progress has always been their priority. The only difference now is that they can lead from the front. I think theres so much thats changed about our industry since we started, says Tegan, growing louder over the hubbub of the busy restaurant. And thats the best part.

Take the BuzzFeed News quiz, made from stories featured in the BuzzFeed News app and the BuzzFeed News newsletter this week. The aftermath of the Panama Papers leak: Which world leader resigned, and which admitted that he owned shares in his late fathers offshore trust? Gunnlaugsson resigned earlier this week after he was named in a leak from a Panama-based law firm that exposed the offshore holdings of 140 politicians (including 12 current and former world leaders). Cameron said he and his wife did own shares in the offshore trust set up by his late father. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton in Wisconsins primary this week. Hes now won how many of the last eight contests? Sanders claimed fresh momentum after the win. Ted Cruz easily won on the Republican side, blunting Donald Trumps momentum as the frontrunner. Which country is the latest to rule that same-sex couples have the right to marry? In a 63 decision by Colombias highest court, the Latin American country joined the ranks of the United States, Mexico, Canada, and Argentina in approving same-sex marriage in the Western Hemisphere. Connecticut demolished Syracuse in the womens NCAA championship game, and Villanova beat North Carolina in a stunning buzzer-beater finish to win their first national title in how many years?

aS"After a district court judge upheld the marriage ban in March, the appeals court on Thursday removed the judge from the case. The district courts ruling errs in so many respects that it is hard to know where to begin, the appeals court held. WASHINGTON A federal appeals court on Thursday stated unambiguously that Puerto Ricos ban on same-sex couples marriages is unconstitutional, throwing a federal judge off a case after the judge had ruled in March that the ban was still in effect. The district courts ruling errs in so many respects that it is hard to know where to begin, the unsigned opinion from the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals stated in harshly criticizing U.S. District Court Judge Juan Prez-Gimnez actions in the case. Prez-Gimnez had ruled in favor of the ban in October 2014, but the 1st Circuit sent the case back to the trial court after the Supreme Courts June 2015 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges striking down marriage bans nationwide. The appeals court ordered Prez-Gimnez to further consider the matter in light of Obergefell, adding that the appeals court judges agree with the parties that the ban is unconstitutional. Nonetheless, in March, Prez-Gimnez upheld the ban for a second time, ruling that the Supreme Courts ruling does not apply to a territory like Puerto Rico. The appeals court disagreed strongly, stating, In ruling that the ban is not unconstitutional because the applicable constitutional right does not apply in Puerto Rico, the district court both misconstrued that right and directly contradicted our mandate. The appeals court granted the request from the parties challenging the ban that the appeals court issue an order requiring the district court to enter judgment in their favor striking down the ban as unconstitutional. The appeals court also took the extraordinary step of kicking Prez-Gimnez off the case, ordering that the case be assigned randomly by the clerk to a different judge to enter judgment in favor of the Petitioners promptly. The matter was before 1st Circuit Judges Juan Torruella, Ojetta Rogeriee Thompson, and William Joseph Kayatta Jr. The opinion, however, was issued per curiam, meaning, by the court as in, it was not signed by any of the judges in particular. Puerto Rico officials have agreed with the parties challenging the ban that Puerto Ricos ban is unconstitutional since the Obergefell decision.

aS"In a 6-3 decision, Colombia joined the ranks of the United States, Mexico, Canada, and Argentina in approving same-sex marriage in the Western Hemisphere. View this image  Revelers flutter a rainbow flag during the Gay Pride Parade in Bogota 2015 Guillermo Legaria / AFP / Getty Images Colombias Constitutional Court ruled Thursday that same-sex couples in the Latin American country have the right to marry. The 6-3 ruling affirmed that no judge or notary could legally turn down a couples marriage request due to their sexual orientation. The decision builds on a 2011 ruling that stated unions between same-sex couples were entitled to legal protections, but dodged the question of marriage. Congress was ordered at the time to pass legislation to reflect the ruling by 2013, but that deadline passed without legislators taking action. Colombian couples began exchanging vows once the deadline passed, an act that Inspector General Alejandro Ordez Maldonado has challenged. Last July, the Court held a day-long hearing on whether the Colombian constitution could be interpreted as allowing same-sex marriage, during which they discussed the then-recent U.S. Supreme Court decision granting marriage equality. The debate split the Colombian government, with President Juan Manuel Santos office supporting marriage equality, while the attorney generals office debated in favor of keeping the existing standard of one man/one woman on the books. That debate was still on the minds of judges in November, when they lifted the countrys limits on same-sex couples being able to adopt. A persons sexual orientation or gender are not in and of themselves indicative of a lack of moral, physical or mental suitability to adopt, Chief Justice Maria Victoria Calle Correa said at the time. In response to the latest ruling, advocacy group Colombia Diversa has already released a video celebrating the decision. This decision by the constitutional court doesnt change our family, the lesbian couple in the video titled Love Wins say. Nor does it transform our love.

aS"The new results make LGBT advocates hopeful for change, though no one knows why a brief chat can be so powerful. View this image  Jeffrey Fountain / Los Angeles LGBT Center Volunteer door-to-door canvassers who engaged in a 10-minute conversation were able to reduce some voters negative feelings about trans people for up to three months, a new study suggests. This decrease in prejudice was greater, the researchers say, than the change in Americans feelings toward gay people from 1998 to 2012. The study, published today in the journal Science, may have strong implications for changing voter attitudes during a time when many cities and states including Houston, Tennessee, Mississippi, and most recently, North Carolina are introducing legislation to ban transgender people from certain restrooms, among other things, based on harmful stereotypes about transgender women being sex predators. A lot of the previous studies on voters suggested things like prejudice and political views are really stubborn and resistant to change, David Broockman, assistant professor of political economy at Stanford and co-author of the study, told BuzzFeed News. What we found are these really large and lasting changes. We couldnt have anticipated it. The new study came out of a collaboration between advocates at the Los Angeles LGBT Center, who developed the canvassing method, and at SAVE Miami, who implemented the canvassing in South Florida. Broockman and his scientific colleagues then analyzed the data gleaned from these interactions. Fifty-six canvassers some of whom were transgender and some who werent engaged in conversations with voters who had previously responded to a survey sent out by Broockman and his group. (The voters did not know the two events were related.) After the initial canvassing effort, Broockman sent follow-up surveys 3 days, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months afterward to measure voter attitudes towards transgender people. These surveys were compared to another group of voters who had been through a placebo conversation about recycling. The researchers found that, after the intervention, the group that had gone through the 10-minute conversation about transgender issues had much more accepting attitudes towards transgender people than the placebo group who had talked about recycling. (This was true regardless of whether the canvasser was transgender.) Measured on a 101-point feelings thermometer commonly used to assess voter attitudes, positive feelings increased by an average of 10 points. The researchers pointed out that this jump is larger than the average 8.5 point increase in positive feelings toward gays and lesbians that was observed in Americans from 1998 to 2012. People in the group that had been canvassed about transgender issues were also more resistant to being swayed by an attack ad featuring anti-transgender stereotypes. To the degree that people go in either not understanding trans issues, [or] maybe having negative perceptions of trans people, they come out of this having much fewer of those fears, Gary Gates, who recently retired as research director at UCLAs Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation Law and Public Policy and was not involved in the study, told BuzzFeed News. One of the three attack ads featuring anti-transgender stereotypes shown to voters. youtube.com The results come nearly a year after the now-notorious study by then-UCLA graduate student Michael LaCour that Broockman and co-author Joshua Kalla exposed as fraudulent. LaCours study had argued that gay canvassers advocating for same-sex marriage were able to change voters minds. Initially heralded by LGBT advocates as a huge victory, and made especially visible by a This American Life episode on the topic, the study ran into problems when the Los Angeles LGBT Center asked Broockman and Kalla to conduct a follow-up study that looked at voter attitudes towards transgender people. That [LaCour] study was very vague on how it was actually done, Broockman said. Not too vague for peer reviewers, but sort of like if you were reading a cookbook and it said bake the chicken we were wondering at what temperature, for how long? They discovered that LaCours data analysis had been completely faked. Shortly after Broockman and Kalla published their critique, the study was retracted. It was terrible, truly terrible, to learn about all this, Dave Fleischer, director of the Leadership LAB at the Los Angeles LGBT Center, who developed and oversaw the canvassing effort, told BuzzFeed News. The only silver lining was that David and Josh had uncovered the fraud and now they were about to measure us for real. The LaCour controversy initially cast a shadow on the entire endeavor. The LaCour study really ended up calling into question the efficacy of these kinds of outreach efforts in election campaigns or referendums, Gates said. And yet, he said, the idea that LaCours theory was totally wrong seemed inconsistent with the experiences of many people on the ground. Advocates are relieved that the new study found that those experiences were, in fact, legitimate. Its lovely that the real results are better than the ones Mike LaCour made up, but we could not have known how it would come out, Fleischer said. No one understands why Broockmans team saw such a big jump in positive attitudes towards transgender people especially considering the hard-fought battles to change mainstream feelings towards gays and lesbians over the past few decades. Some say its possible that greater visibility of transgender people in pop culture sometimes called the Caitlyn Jenner effect means that voter attitudes are more willing or able to be swayed, but only if the right conversation happens. I do think that the combination of marriage equality being nationwide, and the much broader visibility of trans people in the last year or so Jenner, but also shows like Transparent, Orange is the New Black that both of those things may mean that these conversations can in fact have a bigger impact than they may have had a few years ago, said Gates. Fleischer, who has worked closely on organizing efforts in the LGBT community for decades, disagrees. We have zero data to support that idea, he said. So although wed love to think that Caitlyn Jenner alone could shoulder this burden, we might be killing ourselves to believe that. And theres a lot of reason not to believe that. It could simply be that the conversation alone changes minds, he said. There are obviously a variety of things out there in the world that have played some causal role, Fleischer added. But whats interesting to me is that we have a lot of stories we tell ourselves inside the LGBT community about what those causal stories might be stories that we love but its very, very easy to misjudge them. 6.

aS"Exclusive: In his first interview following the furore over his husbands death in Australia, Marco Bulmer-Rizzi told BuzzFeed News of the trauma of losing him again on his way back to Britain. ABC ABC Airport officials in Hong Kong confiscated the ashes of a British mans husband because they did not consider him to be the next of kin, BuzzFeed News can reveal. Marco Bulmer-Rizzi, 38, was carrying the cremated remains of his husband, David Bulmer-Rizzi who died on their honeymoon in Australia after falling down a flight of stairs through Hong Kong International Airport when security staff stopped and questioned him before taking the ashes. The incident on 22 January came just days after BuzzFeed News revealed that Australias refusal to recognise same-sex marriage meant the death certificate stated that David was never married and the funeral arrangements had to be approved by his father. The story sparked an international outcry that led the premier of South Australia to apologise to Bulmer-Rizzi and promise to change the law. It is only now, nearly three months on, that he has felt able to discuss publicly what happened as he tried to fly home with his late husbands ashes. The Hong Kong airport incident proved to be one of numerous problems he encountered while repatriating his husband, partly as a result of international laws not acknowledging their marriage. But Bulmer-Rizzi also said he received little assistance from the UK Foreign Office, prompting him to speak out about the treatment of LGBT spouses when travelling abroad. Because he was not recognised as the next of kin, he did not have a death certificate that detailed his legal claim on the ashes. He said he asked the British authorities to provide him instead with documentation explaining his next-of-kin status so that he could travel home unhindered, but the Foreign Office did not do so. View this image  David Bulmer-Rizzi (left) with Marco Bulmer-Rizzi Marco Bulmer-Rizzi At the stopover in Hong Kong where same-sex marriage is not legal security officials spotted the ashes as they went through the X-ray scanner, prompting a guard to apprehend him. I was taken to one side and she said, Whats in this box? he told BuzzFeed News. She wanted to open the box. And I said, These are human remains. Its my husband. My husband died while we were in Australia. She just looked at me and said, I need to take this away. But before taking the container, the guard inquired again about the identity of the deceased. She said, Who did you say died? And I said, My husband. And this is his passport. And she said, No. Im gonna take this [the ashes] away. Bulmer-Rizzi, who was still in shock from the sudden loss of his husband a week earlier, said that when the security guard removed the ashes he had a meltdown. I put my hand down [on the box] and said, No, you cant. I need to see your supervisor. The officials manager arrived to find Bulmer-Rizzi in a state of distress, trying to stop what was left of his husband from being taken from him. I felt like I was losing him again, he said, adding: All I wanted was to be able to travel with Davids ashes on me so he wouldnt have to travel back by himself. Although it is legal to travel with human remains, Bulmer-Rizzi was aware that he lacked the paperwork confirming their relationship, so he pleaded with the more senior official to release the ashes back into his care. Again I was asked who the remains were and I said, My husband, David. At that point I wanted the world to know that it was my husband. And she asked me, What do you mean your husband? Apart from the deceaseds passport, the only piece of documentation Bulmer-Rizzi said he could give the officer was a letter from the funeral home. The note, he added, merely stated that Davids body had been cremated and the remains I had were human. Marco Bulmer-Rizzi Marco Bulmer-Rizzi Eventually, however, after looking at both passports and the letter, the official decided to overrule the other guard and allowed Bulmer-Rizzi to retrieve the ashes and continue back to the UK. He has since made a complaint to the airport. The situation should not have occurred, he said, and could have been avoided had his pleas to the British consulate before he left Australia been met. I explained to them that I was really worried about travelling with Davids remains because I knew I might end up going through another country claiming to be his husband, possibly where same-sex marriage wasnt even recognised, and I didnt have any official documents [stating their relationship], he said. I specifically asked the consulate if they could give me anything and they said no. He added: The government could have simply issued me a letter saying I was Davids next of kin. My government should step up. The failure to do so, he said, not only exacerbated the difficulties transporting his husbands remains but also exposed wider failures of the Foreign Office to help same-sex couples. Bulmer-Rizzi said he phoned the British consulate in Melbourne after doctors told him that his husband, who was at the time in a coma, would likely die. There was nothing in place, he said, adding that there was also no pertinent information for LGBT people on the Foreign Office website. They werent aware. It came as a complete surprise to them that somebody who is in a same-sex marriage might find themselves in a position where theyre not recognised as the next of kin. Marriage for gay couples came into force in 2014 in England and Wales, but despite it not being available in Australia and in certain states such as South Australia not even overseas same-sex marriages are recognised the consular staff were not prepared for any of the implications for British nationals, he added. I thought whenever there was a change of policy in the UK that would impact UK citizens abroad, there would be some sort of [training] process. They had no information to give me. They had no clue. When BuzzFeed News story of his husbands death hit news channels in Australia, Bulmer-Rizzi said he emailed the woman he had been in contact with at the consulate in Melbourne asking for further advice about repatriating the body. [She] said they were waiting for guidance from London because they were no policies or procedures in place. As the story went viral around the world amid widespread public anger, Jay Weatherill, the premier of South Australia, telephoned Bulmer-Rizzi promising to change the law within months so the state would recognise overseas same-sex marriages, and pledging to issue him with a death certificate that would denote that the deceased was married. Bulmer-Rizzi has since been issued with an interim death certificate that now indicates the marital status of his husband. View this image  Marco Bulmer-Rizzi View this image  Marco Bulmer-Rizzi In many ways South Australia has gone further than my own government has, he said. Although the Foreign Office closed a loophole as a result of the Bulmer-Rizzi case that prevented Britons in a handful of countries being able to get UK-style death certificates, it came too late for him: They [the British consulate] should have understood and stepped in. They should have given me a next-of-kin letter, just something so that if I had issues with the hospital, in terms of making final decisions, I could have just said, Im Davids next of kin and this letter is to confirm that. Without that official acknowledgment, his father-in-law, Nigel Bulmer, had to approve all such final decisions. When you cant makes those choices for your husband, it felt like I was letting David down, he said. Its the worst possible feeling you can have. This is why I want to raise the issue, because I dont want anyone else to go through it. What about all the other [LGBT] people whose partner is taken ill? He called for the Foreign Office to introduce a range of services to better assist Britons in similar circumstances: staff training among embassy and consulate staff to improve knowledge of LGBT laws, a designated employee to deal with LGBT Britons subjected to discrimination, and a section on the Foreign Office website with country-specific advice for LGBT people when travelling abroad. I want somebody [at the Foreign Office] to tell me what theyre doing about this, he said. I want them to understand theres a real person behind this, that there were two real people behind this. I need someone to understand the human impact of it the anguish you go through when that happened and your union is invalid. Thats what it comes down to.  View this image  Marco Bulmer-Rizzi He has been to see his MP, Bridget Phillipson, to discuss how the authorities could improve the consular help currently available, and she is writing to the Foreign Office. Meanwhile, Bulmer-Rizzi called on the government to do more to ensure the rights of LGBT citizens are protected when abroad. This is what marriage equality means, he said. The first step is that we can go to a register officer which was the best day of my life but I had no idea that I would be exposed to a whole other side of what being married means. The next step for same-sex marriage is to issue something that says next of kin. Bulmer-Rizzi also advised gay couples to seek advice before travelling to anti-gay countries, in the event of an emergency, and to consider securing power of attorney status to avoid what he suffered. Jay Weatherill has kept in touch with Bulmer-Rizzi, giving him updates on the progress of changing the law in South Australia to recognise overseas same-sex marriages it is expected to pass within a few months. And in February, Victoria, the state adjacent to South Australia, changed its law as a result of the Bulmer-Rizzi case, beating its neighbour in the process.

That evening, Marco Bulmer-Rizzi uploaded to Facebook photos of the occasion showing the group of friends hugging as they said goodbye to David. The status update ended with a simple message: I am not grateful for many things of late, but I am grateful for having you. A Foreign Office spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that they would happily arrange a meeting between Bulmer-Rizzi and a member of staff to discuss the issues he has raised, and said: We have the greatest sympathy for Mr Bulmer-Rizzi and our staff in Australia and the UK worked hard to offer support and find a practical solution. Following this exceptional case, we put in place a process enabling us to issue a death registration quickly once an application is received. The spokesperson added: We have asked the premiers and chief ministers of states and territories where UK same-sex marriages are currently not recognised to urgently consider legislation or other measures that would allow for such recognition on death certificates. The company responsible for providing security officials to Hong Kong International Airport did not respond to BuzzFeed Newss request for comment.  UPDATE Following publication of this story a spokesman for AVSECO, the company that provides security for the airport, said: We have conducted a thorough record check on the information provided but we did not come across the alleged case on the material date.

aS"A new law dubbed the most anti-LGBT piece of legislation in the U.S. has been condemned by Nissan, IBM, and AT&T. View this image  Protesters in Jackson on Monday. Rogelio V. Solis / AP House Bill 1523 protects individuals, religious organizations, and certain privately held businesses who take actions based on their religious objections to same-sex marriage or any sex outside straight marriage. It also protects those who object to transgender people. The bill says they can not face government retribution if acting based on sincerely held religious beliefs. Prior to the bills passing, the Mississippi Manufacturers Association released a statement outlining its grave concerns that future economic development opportunities will be jeopardized by the law. The MMA cited recent controversies caused by an anti-LGBT law in North Carolina, where on Tuesday PayPal canceled plans for a major expansion because of the legislation. As of Wednesday afternoon, no major company in Mississippi had announced any plans to limit business operations in the state because of the law, but several organizations told BuzzFeed News they condemned what they said was a discriminatory piece of legislation. View this image  The Nissan auto manufacturing facility in Canton, Mississippi. Rogelio V. Solis / AP Nissan has operated a car manufacturing plant in Canton, Mississippi, since May 2003, producing 450,000 vehicles a year and employing more than 3,500 people. Nissan is committed to providing our employees with an inclusive workplace environment that supports diversity. It is Nissans policy to prohibit discrimination of any type, and we oppose any legislation that would allow discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals. When asked what effect, if any, the law would have on the companys future operations in the state, a Nissan spokesperson said the company had no further comment. View this image  Toby Jorrin / Getty Images AT&T employs some 1,300 people around the Mississippi capital, according to the Greater Jackson Alliance. AT&T supports our freedom of speech and religion just as vigorously as we oppose discrimination. Legislation that permits discrimination against any of our employees or customers conflicts with our core values. Our position on discrimination is simple; we oppose it. A spokesperson said the company had no further comment. View this image  Joe Raedle / Getty Images IBM is disappointed that Governor Bryant has signed HB 1523 into law. This legislation will permit discrimination against people based on marriage status, sexual orientation, and gender identity or expression. Laws of this kind do not reflect IBMs values, and are bad for our employees and our business. IBM will continue to follow its global non-discrimination policies in the workplace, and believes that an inclusive and welcoming environment is the best way to attract talented individuals to our company. An IBM spokesperson told BuzzFeed News the company does business in all 50 states, but does not break down employee numbers. View this image  Rogelio V. Solis / AP In February, Bryant signed into law a special session economic package worth hundreds of millions of dollars in state money designed to incentivize Continental Tire opening in the state. As a result, the company announced it would open a $1.4 billion manufacturing plant in Hinds County, creating some 2,500 jobs. The companys decision to bring 2,500 new jobs to Central Mississippi speaks volumes about our dedication to developing the workforce of the future, as well as a business environment that spurs growth, expansion and innovation, Bryant said of the decision. Meanwhile, the companys executive vice president, Paul Williams, said Mississippi had developed an outstanding business climate. Continental is dedicated to promoting diversity and is against discrimination of any kind. We practice this core value in both the workplaces and in the communities we serve across the globe. We will continue to promote our core values throughout our current and future operations.

After the bill was signed into law, a spokesperson told BuzzFeed News: We do intend to expand in the state, but wont be doing it by discriminating against any community. The Marcos Promise of Delight says If you arent delighted, tell us. Well make it right by you. We intend to delight all communities as our expansion in the state continues. facebook.com Based in Mississippi, Billys Original Foods is a frozen food manufacturing company that this month announced plans to hire 25 more people in the Vicksburg area. Billys Original Foods, a startup food manufacturing company, supports a workplace that is diverse and inclusive of all individuals no matter their race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation. Economies, both national and state, that are discriminatory in nature perpetuate self-imposed embargoes on trade and such actions can affect businesses large and small. On a personal note, I am very sad to learn that Mississippi has decided to pass this bill. This bill does not reflect our company or personal views. We are about to hire a whole team of people and we will be inclusive in our hiring practice We are concerned with any laws that may have a bearing on small businesses.

aS"Equal Employment Opportunity Commission officials told BuzzFeed News that transgender workers who have faced discrimination in the workplace can file a federal claim. View this image  AP / David Zalubowski The federal agency that enforces anti-discrimination laws in workplaces told BuzzFeed News it stands ready to investigate complaints from transgender employees in North Carolina where a new law bans transgender people from government building restrooms that match their gender identity. That sort of restriction in workplaces is prohibited by federal law, said Chai Feldblum, one of five members of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The agency held last year that banning a transgender employee from restrooms matching their gender in workplaces with 15 or more workers violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Feldblum and another EEOC official told BuzzFeed News that federal law supersedes local and state laws. Lawmakers in North Carolina vilified transgender women as male sex predators in discussions leading up to the passage in March of House Bill 2, which mandated that restrooms and other single-sex facilities may only be used by those with a matching sex on their birth certificate and repeals local LGBT nondiscrimination ordinances. I want workers to know that even though there isnt yet a federal Equality Act protecting them, even though there is not a state law protecting them, and even though city laws have been removed, they can walk into a federal agency called the EEOC, said Feldblum, who was nominated to her seat on the commission by President Obama. Their claim will be taken, it will be investigated, and they will get help. The North Carolina restrictions, by applying to publicly run facilities, affect restroom access for transgender government employees. North Carolinas state government says it is the states largest employer, with approximately 130,000 employees. The states restroom restrictions also apparently extend to city and local government facilities; BuzzFeed News was not able to to determine how many people are employed by local jurisdictions in the state. Justine Lisser, a spokesperson for the EEOC, told BuzzFeed News that EEOC officials have discussed the issue of transgender rights with the agencys attorneys in North Carolina, adding, Our staff there is well aware of the ramifications of the new state law and how our law supersedes it in the employment context. Not only do we stand ready to accept such charges, Lisser said, we have filed lawsuits around the country on behalf of people discriminated against in employment due to their gender identity or transition. Investigators may not wait long to hear a complaint. Joaqun Carcao, a transgender man who works at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, may file a complaint with the EEOC for being banned from mens restrooms on campus, according to his lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union. [The North Carolina law] clearly tries to force government employers in North Carolina to violate Title VII, and we are monitoring those violations across the state and are considering filing a charge on behalf of our client, Chase Strangio, an ACLU lawyer, told BuzzFeed News. View this image  Protesters at a rally in Charlotte on March 31. Skip Foreman / AP The ACLU currently represents Carcao, along with several others, in a lawsuit that alleges the North Carolina law violates the Constitution and education-related civil rights laws; that suit does not specifically address employment discrimination. The law affects a wide net, from education and judiciary facilities to universities and any other political subdivision of the state. The latter term is not clearly defined in state law, but counties of North Carolina identify themselves as political subdivisions in official records, and a lawyer for the ACLU of North Carolina told BuzzFeed News the term is thought to encompass all counties, all cities, and all of their respective departments. As such, transgender workers in a wide range of government employment from park groundskeepers to public health workers are banned from work restrooms that match their gender identity under state law. Feldblum does point out, though, that there are limitations in how Title VII can be enforced. Title VII bans discrimination on the basis of sex, and the EEOC, the Obama administration, and some courts have held that transgender discrimination is sex discrimination. Although the EEOC investigates complaints of workplace discrimination involving public and private employers, if it finds reasonable cause for a lawsuit against a state or local government, it must refer the case to the Department of Justices Employment Litigation Section. That section routinely sues local governments for allegations of discrimination on the basis of sex. We have not yet referred that sort of case [to the Justice Department] because we have not had one but there may be one of those from North Carolina, Feldblum said. Asked how federal lawyers would handle such referrals, Dena Iverson, a spokesperson for the Justice Department, cited the Employment Litigation Sections policy for accepting EEOC cases. She also referred to comments last week from U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who said, The Department of Justice and the Obama administration is determined to ensure that transgender individuals can live the lives they were born to lead fully, without discrimination and with the support of their community and their country. On the day Mississippis governor signed a bill into law that protects people who refuse services to LGBT people on religious grounds, Feldblum weighed in on Twitter, noting that Title VII trumps state law there, too. Note to employers in Miss: Title VII does not allow individuals to discriminate on basis of sex bec of religious beliefs, she wrote. Courts have not consistently upheld that Title VIIs ban on sex discrimination includes anti-transgender discrimination in cases of banning restroom use and to date, no federal appeals court has upheld that interpretation. Nevertheless, Feldblum noted that district courts have done so, and the agency has negotiated numerous settlements with employers without lawsuits. This past week, Feldblum noted that the EEOC resolved 25 complaints alleging anti-trans discrimination that were brought to the commission in 2015. We are going to help a lot of transgender people get to use a restroom without ever having to see this inside of a court, she said. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

The campaign, which also featured characters named after syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia, was designed to promote condom use to reduce the spread of STIs, but the two characters named after AIDS were were deemed insensitive and stigmatising. One character told users to only swipe right if you like incurable diseases, while another offered a knock knock joke: Knock knock. Whos there?

Were not the butt of their jokes, and were sure as hell not collateral damage in their pursuit of profits.

aS"In recent weeks, state legislatures have passed sweeping new anti-LGBT rights bills in Mississippi, North Carolina, and Georgia (where the governor vetoed the legislation). On Tuesday, the states U.S. senators insisted there was no division within the party over the moves. View this image  Jonathan Ernst / Reuters WASHINGTON Southern senators representing states embroiled in a battle over LGBT laws on Tuesday rejected the idea that the issue was causing friction between the pro-business and evangelical wings of the Republican Party and stressed their lack of involvement in the debate. Senators representing North Carolina, Georgia, and Mississippi returned to Washington after a two-week recess during which their home states acted on controversial LGBT laws that several major corporations have condemned. In North Carolina, the state rushed through a bill to repeal LGBT protections and bar transgender people from using certain restrooms. The states senator, Richard Burr, who is up for re-election, is already facing attacks from Democrats for saying the legislation does not discriminate. In a quick interview with BuzzFeed News on Tuesday following a decision by PayPal to cancel its expansion in the Tar Heel state over the law, Burr insisted that the measure was not going to hurt the states economy. Listen, the decision is of the General Assembly and the governor, he said. Theres no federal jurisdiction in this. I trust that theyve looked at all the consequences from it. The truth is I still meet with more companies that are looking at North Carolina as a potential home for them. Our state offers things that other states dont. Certainly PayPal didnt see that as important enough. When asked about the backlash in his home state and fractures within the party over the issue, he responded: You dont hear any existing businesses down there talking about leaving. PayPals investment in the state would have created 400 jobs. Sen. Thom Tillis, who also represents North Carolina, told BuzzFeed News he had just returned to the United States from congressional delegation overseas and had been briefed on the issue Tuesday morning. Tillis said he hasnt spoken to Gov. Pat McCrory, who signed the bill into law late last month and is also facing a tough re-election, but stressed that the issue is in the hands of the state. Its a matter of state policy, he said. I would defer to the state legislature and governor. With regard to the businesses, thats a choice that they have to make. I think its unfortunate that they would withdraw, particularly when you look at the state of North Carolinas financial services sector is one of the strongest employment bases. Days after North Carolina moved forward with the bill, Mississippi on Tuesday passed into law what is believed to be the most sweeping anti-LGBT measure. It includes provisions similar to the federal First Amendment Defense Act, a bill introduced in the House and Senate last year that senators from all three states North Carolina, Georgia, and Mississippi signed onto as co-sponsors. Spokesmen for Mississippi Sens. Roger Wicker and Thad Cochran did not immediately return requests for comment. While governors in North Carolina and Mississippi advanced anti-LGBT rights measures, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal vetoed a religious liberty bill last week. The states senator, Johnny Isakson, who is also up for re-election, said in an interview he was glad Deal vetoed the bill even though he supports the First Amendment Defense Act. I think the First Amendment of the Constitution guarantees religious liberty for all people, he said. Any laws that carry out that guarantee ought to be passed at the federal level, not the state level. Otherwise, we would have a patchwork of laws in 50 different states. Asked if the issue has caused divisions within his party back home, Isakson said, No, no, no, before walking into a lunch meeting with the rest of the Republican conference. Sen. David Perdue, the other senator from Georgia, called the debate over LGBT laws an important issue, adding that he hasnt seen much evidence yet of businesses leaving states over the issue. You always have that rhetoric, he said. This is an issue that obviously has to find its own balance. 3. Georgias Governor Vetoes Religious Liberty Bill buzzfeed.com 4.

aS"I didnt expect to start dressing differently when I started dating a woman. But Ive realized that Im not the same, and my clothes dont need to be either. View this image  Charlotte Gomez / BuzzFeed Two hours after I came out to my mom over the phone last summer, she called me back with a follow-up question: Are you still going to wear dresses? I thought this was funny, and sweet. It was funny because it was so mom, but even more so because I loved dresses. I laughed. Yes!! I assured her. Of course I would still wear them. I was exactly the same person as before. Right? About a month later I flew back home to Minnesota for my 10-year high school reunion, and my mom and I went shopping. I bought an emerald green sundress my favorite color. It was a little too daytime beachside barbecue for my reunion, but I texted a picture of me wearing it to my new girlfriend, and she texted back a series of heart-eye emojis, so I decided to buy it anyway. I packed it into my suitcase, flew back to Brooklyn, and hung it up in my closet, where it has remained, untouched, ever since. Ive worn a dress once or twice since then to a fundraiser cocktail party in muggy early September; on some other ordinary day too hot to consider allowing fabric to touch my inner thighs but somehow, at some point, without realizing that a shift was taking place until it was complete, something horrible happened: I proved my mother right. I dont want to wear dresses. I am not exactly the same person as before. View this image  I didnt really notice anything was up until fall came, and suddenly one of my favorite easy workday looks a sweater over a skirt with tights and boots no longer appealed to me. Something just lookedoff. All my skirts were too poofy, and the dresses hung lifelessly off my body; I looked too girly. As someone who, at least until recently, liked to look somewhat girly, at least some of the time someone who regularly browsed Anthropologies sale section, whod pictured Kevin Costners wifes wedding dress as the platonic ideal of wedding dresses since 2004 this was disorienting to me. I chalked it up to the normal ups and downs of dressing oneself, vowing to try the offending outfit again a few days later. But then that day came, and it still didnt look, or feel, right. It is a strange feeling to miss my dresses as they hang, unharmed and available, in my closet. The only thing stopping me from wearing them is me. I wish I still wanted to wear them, but I dont. I dont want new ones, either, and because of that, an entire window of shopping possibility has closed on me. It isnt just dresses and skirts, either; I am losing entire stores. My internet browsers search bar still auto-fills the names of former favorites Madewell, H&M, J.Crew, Ann Taylor Loft, all the places Id almost always been able to find something I wanted. But after I stopped looking at their dresses, I noticed myself losing interest in their other clothes, too. Suddenly it all looked soheterosexual. Maybe it is silly to grieve my lost appreciation for mass-market retailers, but not knowing where to shop makes me sad, because I love to shop. I am not looking to adopt some sort of Marie Kondoesque Zen state in which I accept simplicity and minimalism into my life. I would prefer to have a shit ton of clothes I love. I would prefer to be so overwhelmed by choice that I must plan my outfits in advance. In my senior year of high school, my best friend and I had a competition to see who could go longest into the year without repeating an outfit. She won, but I made it into early November. I feel overwhelmed, for sure, but not because theres too much to choose from. I feel overwhelmed by opening my closet and seeing clothes I cant even remember wanting. I feel overwhelmed when I run my hand over the soft silk of my dresses and wonder whether I should donate them, or keep them just in case I one day change again. I am overwhelmed by the pervasive sense of in-betweenness I feel not yet ready to let go, unsure how to move forward. The truth is that, for me, coming out was easy. I sent texts to my friends, emailed my brothers, and called my parents. Nobody was mad, or even very alarmed; everyone was proud, and happy for me. Somewhat to my reality-show-loving disappointment, nobody cried. I didnt technically lose anything. I was happy too, and relieved, and still am. But enough time has gone by that the post-revelatory euphoria has faded, and so (at least, I think) has most peoples curiosity and interest in talking about this identity shift of mine. Id rather my sexuality be no big deal than a huge one, but I also dont exactly want it to be no size of deal at all. After a lifetime of feeling left out of my friends dating conversations by my perpetual singleness, Id looked forward to getting all caught up and included once I got into a relationship of my own. But Ill never be caught up. Ill never have experienced teenage love, and Ill never have had the kind of sexy early-twenties hijinks so many of my friends have. Im in my first relationship at 29, and Im dating a woman, and almost all my friends are straight, and its not completely different, but its different enough. Ive talked about guys with my friends all my life, but I just waived the extremely small amount of street cred I had. And the queer friends Ive made have all been out much longer than I have, and around them, I dont feel gay enough. Im suddenly underqualified for everything. So I feel adrift. Like everybody else, I am convinced I am singularly, hopelessly, particularly alone in my circumstances. Theres not a lot to do about it apart from, I guess, continuing to allow time to pass. I hope to eventually lose interest in my own queerness in favor of something else, like, I dont know, artisanal bread baking. But for now, it is still fresh, and I am not yet comfortable. View this image  As my identity has shifted, so, too, has the audience I have in mind when I get dressed. While I still want my straight friends to think I look great, I really, really want my queer female friends to think I look great. I also just want to look queer. At least more so. At least enough so that when I see a pair of lesbians on the street in Brooklyn, it is possible they will look at me and recognize me as a card-carrying member of the club. While I know that queer women can wear any style they want and be no more or less queer because of it, there are some signifiers. But my tattoos are minimal, and my face is unpierced; I am pretty sure I lack the edge to pull off sweatpant joggers, and most hats just look stupid on me. If I want to look a little gayer at a formal event, I could wear a suit instead of a dress. But on ordinary days (which is most of them), Im still trying to figure out how to look both a little gayer and like myself. (Mostly, so far, it is in the shoes.) When I started dating my girlfriend, I used to watch over her shoulder while she browsed her favorite online store on her phone. (So soothing, like watching someone else play a video game youve never played and never will.) The first thing I noticed were the prices: They were suspiciously low. Is that in American dollars?! I yelled. Yup, she said. Mens clothing is where its at. I watched for another couple minutes in silence. Then: Wait! I like that shirt!! So, because it was only eight dollars, my girlfriend bought it for me. Its a black, short-sleeved T-shirt, but the crew neck is high, and the sleeves are long enough to roll up, the way I like. I downloaded the stores app to my own phone and have since begun cautiously injecting a bit of menswear into my closet. Its not easy. For one thing, most mens clothing is boring as hell. You just dont see a male equivalent of, like, peplum. There is a way to look cool in simple combinations of pants and T-shirts and jackets Ive seen it done again and again on the various tomboy fashion Instagrams Ive followed but I havent quite figured it out for myself. While it has been confusing to grow disconnected from so much of the clothing I once loved, it is also exciting to imagine what might take its place. It is a slow process (which is good for my bank account, at least), and often a frustrating one. Sometimes, rudely, the things that look cool on hot Instagram models do not look all that cool on me. Many of the things Ive ordered online, warily and hopefully, Ive returned. Successes are few, but invigorating: a hooded black spring jacket, mens and therefore maybe the first Ive owned with sleeves long enough for my arms; a pair of black sneakers that went on my feet like glass slippers. (If theres one thing that has remained constant, its a heavy preference for black.) Its now early spring, which means its finally time to clean out my closet. This, really, is something I should have done months ago, regardless of seasonal appropriateness its messy, full of things I havent worn in ages. Im planning to get rid of most of them, which will be hard, but isnt it almost always? When I went off to college, I nearly cried throwing out my JV tennis T-shirts, and they were sweat-stained and hideous. But you have to let go of former selves to make space for new ones. I love that green dress I never wore, but I have a friend itll look great on, and Id rather she have it now than I hang on to it just in case. As much as I hoped that Id come out and feel at once fully realized, somehow done as a person, all the available evidence suggests I will only continue to change and grow in other, as yet unknown, ways. Maybe next year Ill be into culottes. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .

aS"Four hundred new jobs were on the line. View this image  AP / Jeff Chiu PayPal announced Tuesday that it is canceling an expansion in North Carolina that would have employed 400 people, the latest and one of the starkest examples of the repercussions for the state passing a law overriding local LGBT-rights ordinances and banning transgender people from bathrooms that match their gender identity. PayPal had announced the expansion project just two weeks ago. In the short time since then, said a statement from company president and CEO Dan Schulman, legislation has been abruptly enacted by the State of North Carolina that invalidates protections of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender citizens and denies these members of our community equal rights under the law. He continued, saying the new law perpetuates discrimination and it violates the values and principles that are at the core of PayPals mission and culture. As a result, PayPal will not move forward with our planned expansion into Charlotte. Backlash has mounted since Republican leaders of the North Carolina General Assembly convened a one-day special session to rush through House Bill 2, leading to a federal lawsuit that argues the law is unconstitutional and ferocious corporate backlash. Major companies including Facebook, Apple, and Google have been at the vanguard of the resistance, further cementing the role of Fortune 500 companies advocating for LGBT rights, particularly in states where GOP leaders run on pro-business platforms. Gov. Pay McCrory has repeatedly argued the law would not have any impact on recruiting jobs to the state. He has contended the law is necessary to keep transgender women, whom he calls men, out of womens restrooms for safety and privacy reasons. But Attorney General Roy Cooper pounced on the PayPal news to make an economic case to repeal the law. The threat that HB 2 poses to jobs and our economy is no longer a possibility, its a reality, said Cooper, a Democrat who has refused to defend the state in court and is himself running for governor. Everyday working families are suffering from this law. The Charlotte Business Journal has reported that PayPals expansion would have an annual payroll impact of nearly $20.4 million. Asked about PayPals announcement at a press conference on Tuesday, McCrory attempted to reframe the issue around bathroom safety. He made no differentiation between men and transgender women essentially arguing that transgender women are men, and thus should be banned from womens restrooms. For those who disagree with that basic norm, they have that decision to make, he said, adding, I expect that PayPal will still provide their services and accept our consumer money in the state of North Carolina. youtube.com There are no documented examples in 17 states and more than 200 cities with LGBT nondiscrimination protections jurisdictions that grant transgender people access to facilities that match their gender identity of the laws being used for predatory purposes. In addition to the White Houses recent condemnation of North Carolina, governors of New York and Washington State and many cities have banned nonessential government travel to North Carolina to protest the law. Our decision is a clear and unambiguous one, PayPals Schulman statement said. As a company that is committed to the principle that everyone deserves to live without fear of discrimination simply for being who they are, becoming an employer in North Carolina, where members of our teams will not have equal rights under the law, is simply untenable. 2.

aS"It turns out AIDS jokes are frowned upon these days. Who knew? herocondoms.com.au herocondoms.com.au The advertising campaign launched on Tinder on Monday night, and features a series of anthropomorphised STIs introducing themselves with tongue-in-cheek biographies. My ideal date would start with a single unusual sore. Id then spice things up with skin rashes and sores in your mouth, vagina and bum. Romantic much?, says Sydphilis. While Jonorrhoea tells users to Swipe right if youre looking for something serious. Infertile kind of serious. herocondoms.com.au herocondoms.com.au Critical to our efforts to reach youth and destigmatise the use of condoms, is to encourage young people that being prepared is actually being sexy, he said. Carrying a condom should not be seen as a sign of bravado or promiscuity but rather a symbol that you are in charge of your own sexual health and that of your partner(s). View this image  Two characters, named Aydes and Aidy, offer jokes about HIV and AIDS. Knock knock. Whos there? AIDS , says Aidy, while Aydes tells people to only swipe right if you like incurable diseases. The two profiles relating to AIDS have been removed from Heros website but are still circulating on social media. Beyond the factual errors, the campaign associates human characteristics with STIs, reinforcing the idea that certain types of people are to blame for STIs. Avoiding a certain type of person isnt how you avoid contracting STIs, he said. It contributes to stigma surrounding STIs, which is precisely what leads to people not getting tested and treated for them. Holas said the AIDS-related ads in particular are offensive and factually incorrect. The most glaring [errors] are the AIDS-related profiles. AIDS is a syndrome that you cant catch off a Tinder root. The profiles ramp up the horror story narrative with STI symptoms and treatments, i.e. penile swabs which is an outdated and abandoned practice. View this image  The companys co-founder, Dustin Leonard, conceded that the ads had not made a clear enough distinction between HIV and AIDS, but did not apologise for using AIDS as a punchline. The aim of this campaign was to destigmatise condom use. It was never our intention to single out people living with HIV or AIDS, he said. Would the response have been different if wed made similar jokes about STIs other than HIV or AIDS? We would never want to stigmatise people living with AIDS. The ads have been very well received. Weve had coverage in Mashable the New York Daily News, and the Daily Mail. I think theres been one negative article. View this image  The goal of this campaign was to get people talking and thinking about safe sex and we appreciate you joining the discussion. We appreciate your views on the ways in which we could make this more inclusive and effective. It was and is not our intention to isolate or stigmatise anyone who has an STI and would welcome the opportunity to sit down with you to discus future communication. Health experts say that the rates of certain STIs (such as HIV and Gonorrhoea) are on the rise in Australia, in many cases, among young people. This campaign was designed to connect directly with young people and bring awareness to the fact that many people may not even know they have an STI. Condoms help protect against STIs and it is important for us to continue encouraging anyone who is sexually active to protect themselves and their partner(s) from health risks.

aS"In discovering the secret world of cruising for sex, I became a poet. View this image  Will Varner / BuzzFeed One afternoon a few weeks after I arrived in Sofia, Bulgaria, where I would spend the next four years teaching high school English, a friend and I were wandering around downtown, exploring the city without any particular aim in mind. We were crossing beneath the National Palace of Culture a series of underground walkways, called podlezi in Bulgarian, connect the avenues on either side when we saw with relief (we both needed to piss) the painted blue sign for a public toilet. I still dont know what tipped me off as we began the long descent to the little booth at the bottom of the stairs where a woman would take our 50 stotinki; there was no one else around, and there was no graffiti scratched on the walls or sounds coming from the rooms around the corner, past the womans booth. Maybe it was some chemical signature in the air that made me turn to my friend, who was straight, and tell him that it was a bathroom where men were having sex, that he should be quick and use a stall, that he shouldnt look at anyone unless he intended an invitation. I could barely speak Bulgarian at this point, everything about the mores of life above ground continued to baffle me; but as we turned into the three chambers of the bathrooms beneath the National Palace of Culture I was suddenly an expert, each man I saw communicating by nonverbal codes that were far easier for me to read than the Cyrillic of Bulgarian street signs. I read them without any effort at all; Id been using them my entire adult life. As I returned to those bathrooms over the next weeks, the next months and years, I communicated by means of the codes I first learned in the parks and bathrooms of Louisville, Kentucky, the communities where I first came into a sense of myself as a gay man and where I first experienced queerness as a source not only of shame but also of joy. And it was the experience of cruising, though my adolescent self would never have guessed it, though I wasnt writing at all in those years, that first prepared me to be a poet. But really I want to say something stronger than that: not just that cruising made me a poet, but also that cruising itself is a kind of poetry, that the two phenomena, as I experience them, can serve as similes for each other. Cruising carves out intimacies in public space in the same way poetry carves out intimacies in public discourse; and cruising is also itself a kind of discourse, with codes that have to be secret in plain sight, legible to those in the know but able to pass beneath general notice, like one of Wyatts sonnets. Both poetry and cruising have a structure that is essentially epiphanic, offering the sudden, often ecstatic revelation of a meaning that emerges from the inchoate stuff of quotidian life. As poetry declares a system of value incomprehensible to the world of Yeats bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen, a value different from that of commerce and instrumental usefulness, so cruising depends on an idea of the value of human interactions shorn of the usual institutions that mark that value. And, maybe most profoundly, both poetry and cruising are arts of loneliness and the assuagement of loneliness. View this image  Will Varner / BuzzFeed I dont have a distinct memory now of the first time I cruised or the first man I met, but I do remember the first time I understood what cruising was. I was at Western Kentucky University, in Bowling Green, where I spent a few weeks one summer in a camp for kids who had scored well on a standardized test. We were left largely to our own devices in the early evenings after our classes, or at least thats how I remember it, and one afternoon I happened upon a bathroom tucked in a corner of the student center. I didnt see anyone cruising that day, or any other day probably in the summer months trade was slow, or maybe seeing a kid hanging out there scared everybody off but I did see the messages men left for one another, notes and obscene drawings in the stalls, a kind of hieroglyphics I pored over with an excitement Id never felt before. There were huge erupting cocks and spread-open asses and scrawled promises and terms, dates and times and phone numbers and the occasional plea in a tone whose urgency I recognized: I sucked you off here last Wednesday, I want to see you again, please call me. Pre-internet personals. Those notes were the first real evidence I had that the world might offer some answer to the desire I felt. I went back to this bathroom again and again, each day choosing a different stall, reading the walls and feeling, as I jerked off, the easing of a deep loneliness. How natural, then, that years later I should feel an affinity for poetry, which also requires the tuning of ones sensibility to catch occult frequencies. Cruising, the ability to find a hidden significance in a public place, gave me a feeling not of exclusion but election, and I felt something similar when I found meaning in Bishop or Hayden or Stevens that was lost on others. It was the sensing of a value made only more dear by going largely unrecognized. This strange point of contact between my adolescence in Kentucky and my adulthood in Bulgaria, a feeling of homecoming in foreignness that occurred again and again in my years in Sofia, served as the spark for my first novel, which begins in the bathrooms at the National Palace of Culture, and traces a relationship between an American narrator and a young man he meets there and pays for sex. One of the things I want to do in my work is portray cruising places with something like the richness they have in my experience of them, a richness entirely lost in homophobic narratives that cast them solely as places of violence and disease, of a dirtiness ascribed not only to physical spaces but to the people who frequent them. Theres no room in these narratives for what Ive sometimes found in those spaces, which is an intimacy whose value is independent of duration, a lyric value, Im tempted to say, which seems to me inexhaustible: moments of mutual recognition that are profound and merit reverence. I dont intend to romanticize these spaces or maybe I do, a little, and maybe they deserve a little romance after decades of denigration. They can be dangerous, people are assaulted in them, or robbed, or used in instrumental or dehumanizing ways, all of which is to say that theyre spaces where human beings act in human ways. Theyre also spaces in which the radical potential of queerness still inheres, a potential that has been very nearly expunged from a mainstreaming, homonormative vision of gay life. Part of the threat of queerness has always been the specter of rootlessness, not just because queer lives often form bonds outside monogamous, child-centered family units, but also because queerness itself is a kind of free radical, appearing willy-nilly in every population and allowing for identification across the usual lines of allegiance. Surely this is part of what makes queer literature and art so cosmopolitan, so vital and wide-ranging in its affiliations. In my own case, at least, Mishima and Cavafy and Baldwin and Guibert all addressed me with equal intimacy when I was a teenager in Kentucky. They all spoke to me the secret of myself. Like those books, cruising zones are staging grounds for boundary-crossing identifications. The bathrooms at the National Palace of Culture attract men of all different backgrounds, men unlikely ever to meet in their workaday lives. In Cherokee Park in Kentucky, I met men everything in my life seemed designed to separate me from: men of color, men from different parts of town, from different class backgrounds, all drawn by desire to a space where the usual categories by which we organize our lives race, class can be scrambled by desire. Of course those categories didnt fall away in any permanent way; we went back to different worlds, with different horizons of possibility, after the moments we spent together. But the days and nights we spent in the park perforated lives we often work to seal off in communities that seem ever more narrowly construed. Cruising spaces enable face-to-face encounters across gulfs of difference and privilege, encounters that take place beyond the structuring gaze of authority and often, at least initially, under the liberating cover of anonymity. Anytime you have a face-to-face encounter, I think, you have a moment of possibility that can engage the whole range of emotional and moral response; you have the potential for a kind of ethical spark, tenuous, fragile, almost certainly destined to fail, just possibly transformative. The erotic functions for me in several ways, the great poet Audre Lorde wrote. The sharing of joy, whether physical, emotional, psychic, or intellectual, forms a bridge between the sharers which can be the basis for understanding much of what is not shared between them, and lessens the threat of their difference. Its a Romantic idea, fantastical, surely untrue. And yet the hope of it seems valuable to me. View this image  Will Varner / BuzzFeed Physical joy is a good phrase for what Ive often found in these places, and maybe its part of what explains their durability. Like poetry, cruising zones are constantly said to be on the verge of disappearance. Cruising communities were responses to circumstances of oppression that have passed, this prediction goes a claim both parts of which seem dubious to me and so they will disappear now that theyre no longer needed. But its hard to sustain this argument in the face of the reality that they havent disappeared, that they persist even in the places of greatest queer privilege. In Midtown Manhattan, just blocks from the slick, commercial gay bars of Hells Kitchen, the video stores on 8th Avenue are thriving cruising communities, where regulars greet one another by name, chatting when trade is slow. Maybe if these communities persist even in the zones of greatest freedom for gay people, they serve a function greater than the need for secrecy maybe they arent merely havens for shame, maybe they have their own undomesticated joy. Another argument would have it that apps like Grindr have made these communities obsolete. But again its difficult to explain the persistence of analog cruising, or the fact that often enough offline and digital cruising happen side by side: Go to a cruising place today and youll see men cruising with their phones in hand, on- and offline at once. Physical cruising, as I experience it, is more valuable, richer both sensually and ethically, than online cruising. If the kind of cruising I grew up with is poetry, then Grindr isnt just prose, but Strunk and White, prose stripped to function. The circulation of bodies in physical space allows for a greater possibility of being surprised by desire, of having an unexpected response to the presence of another. In online cruising, as in pornography, the reality of anothers body is to a very great extent erased in its reduction to an image. When I cruise in real life, a man whose framed torso might have seemed unremarkable catches me by the way he moves, or the way he smells, or by the tone of his voice or heat of his glance or by any of the million other traits we lose when we reduce ourselves to a short list of a stats, a little boxed image on a screen. Online cruising allows us to determine too much, to search or filter by age, body type, race. Swiping left, it seems to me, is always a degraded response to another human person. Distance-based apps, especially in dense urban centers, often offer nothing beyond a particular neighborhood or block, canceling out much of the radical potential of cruising zones. Most fundamentally, staring at a screen of profiles I often feel deadened, inattentive, dazed, full of a longing for which theres no satisfaction, at once in need and desperately bored. In a bathroom or park or video store, with the reality of other bodies around me, fucking or longing to fuck, Im almost never bored, I feel quick with animal alertness. I feel physically alive in these spaces, in my body and attentive to the bodies of others; I also feel more acutely than at any other time the proximity of the physical and the metaphysical, the way our bodies are keys to something we sense lies beyond them. This is what makes them lyric spaces, I think. I dont really believe in any realm beyond the physical, but I do believe in art, which is what I do with those intimations of metaphysics. Art is where I try to put the overflow of feeling wonder, gratitude, maybe its fair to say love that sometimes fills the bathroom stalls or video booths where I experience the body of another. At times it seems to me as if, as in some 17-century poem, all the value of the teeming world is concentrated there. What does it matter if I dont exchange names with a man, if I never see him again, why should that lessen the value of the pleasure we give one another, a bodily pleasure and also a pleasure of knowledge and recognition? Now we have met, we have lookd, we are safe, says Whitman, our great poet of cruising, who doesnt hesitate to use the word love for transient encounters between otherwise strangers. Like the stanzas of a poem, which offer such unlikely, durable shelter from the crash of public speech, the cramped spaces of back rooms and toilet stalls serve not to lessen value, but to concentrate it. As is the case for poetry in the valley of its making, cruising offers an experience that might look like privation but feels like luxury, a hidden richness, a secret world. *** Garth Greenwell is the author of Mitko, which won the 2010 Miami University Press Novella Prize and was a finalist for the Edmund White Award for Debut Fiction and a Lambda Award.

View this image  The H2 bill, signed into law on March 23, prohibits transgender people from using bathrooms that dont match the gender listed on their birth certificate. A federal lawsuit against the state was filed by the ACLU last Monday.

aS"For me, tattoos are an investment in self-love. View this image  Behind every tattoo, theres a great story (or a poor, drunken decision but usually, theres a great story). We reached out to trans and gender-nonconforming people to ask specifically about the tattoos that represent or reflect their identity. Some pieces were inked to mark important milestones of self-discovery while others serve as small reminders of the bumps along the way. Heres what they told us: Instagram: @kbfoto615 Instagram: @kbfoto615 I have a caduceus symbol tattooed on my left forearm. This image was adopted as the symbol for medicine sometime in the late 19th century. It has been used to represent modern medicine and for me, it is used to represent my medical struggles. I suffer from several chronic illnesses, some invisible and some not, and I have battled them for almost my entire life. I got this tattoo to show that even though some of my illnesses may be invisible, even though they may get the better of me sometimes, every single new day is a day Ive fought these illnesses, and won. It reminds me that Im blessed to still be here.  Kendall View this image  I finally finished covering up my bodily reminders of self destruction. Ive spent too long believing that my queer, trans and black body was disposable, and Ive done my part to chip away at myself. Ive gone from destructing to decorating this body I was given. Loving my trans black ass is the best ways to stick it the systems that try to keep folks like me down. A patch of kente cloth to remind me of where Ive been, how far Ive come, and to follow my path no matter how it twists and turns.  Britt View this image  My tattoo has the lyrics: Even on a cloudy day, Ill keep my eyes fixed on the sun from Cage the Elephants song Shake Me Down. This song kept me going through a lot of hard times and means a lot to me.  Jamie Courtesy of Rhys Courtesy of Rhys I am a transgender girl from Western Australia and this is my tattoo. I got it whilst attending Beauty School to become a professional makeup artist. I wanted something that was going to be meaningful and also represent the person that I am today. This tattoo was extremely therapeutic. I decided to get it to be a permanent reminder to myself, and others, that I am beautiful, inside and out. Despite not always feeling that growing up, I can guarantee that I do now. It shows a side of me that is generally quite easily noticed from my appearance, glamorous.. But that isnt what it is about. Its about how I feel, not how I look.  Rhys View this image  I came out as a trans guy at 16, and started hormones at 18 years old. Testosterone has saved my life and changed the way I look at my existence significantly. Im so grateful for it. Im confident, strong, and I finally see the person in front of me that Ive always felt on the inside. So, I decided to get the chemical molecule of testosterone with one of my syringes going through it just to be a nerd.  Logan View this image  I have a green carnation on my right hip and a violet on my left hip. Both flowers have significance in queer history violets stretching back to the Greek poet Sappho. For me, tattoos are an investment in self-love. Even on the bad days, I can look past my troubles and remember that I am not alone in my struggles, and that my body is pretty no matter what my dysphoria says.  Natt View this image  Its a tattoo to affirm to myself that each day I am coming closer to representing the man that I know I really am. It takes work from me in doing so (mentally and physically) and sometimes it gets a bit much so its good to have that permanent reminder that Im doing okay.  Lee View this image  I have many tattoos that tell a story but this is the tattoo I did to symbolize my transition. The butterfly is a traditional representation of transition but I needed it to be more than that. I added the inverted triangle to represent the black triangle given to trans men and lesbians during the Holocaust to remind myself about the people who have suffered before me and to keep in mind that others are still suffering because of who they are. I also filled in the black triangle with baby blue to represent my colors in the transgender flag. Last, within the butterfly there is a skull which serves the dual purpose of stating transition or die and making my butterfly super manly. I put the tattoo on my hand because my transition has been such a great and healthy step for me, even though it has been difficult. Lucky for me, even though I live in a state where I can still be fired for being transgender, cis people have no idea what the imagery represents. I look forward to the day where I can be out all the time without sacrificing my job, but until that day I have a rad tattoo right out in the open for people who know what to look for.  Maxwell The anchor symbolizes strength and stability and being transgender in todays society, thats hard to find. I see the ink as a reminder that no matter how tough my gender dysphoria is, how difficult it is to be respected, or how challenging it is to fight the social constructs of gender that attempt to strip me from my masculinity, I can get through it. Doesnt matter if its a wave or a tsunami, Ill persevere.  Britt View this image  This tattoo was done for my one year on Testosterone. I collaborated with a tattoo artist on this design as i wasnt sure how the syringe would look, as its often associated as rough or drug users. We came up with using the idea of the Testosterone molecule to be placed inside the syringe, symbolizing Testosterone. Im attracted to the old-fashion style needles and wanted the colors not to be bright, but to be almost like black and white with a bit of blue to make it pop. Alex View this image  The story behind my tattoo is simple. I grew up feeling second-rate compared to my contemporaries. I wasnt strong, fast, or particularly smart, so I decided to work harder, get ahead, and stay ahead. I decided that I was going to be the best of the best, bar none. This was going to be true of whatever I did, from fast food to athletics, to police work. The tattoo itself is a stylized two, representing my second-rate past and broken apart to symbolize my stubborn need to get better. Im getting into police academy training at the end of the summer, and by then, will be able to enter ready to graduate at the top of my class. And I will do all of this as a transgender woman.  Madison View this image  My tattoo says True Self. The day I got it was my 29th birthday and the day I was able to book my hysterectomy. Just over three years ago I came out, this June will mark my second year on testosterone and one year post-op. I got my tattoo because I am finally becoming the me I have been inside all along. With everything I have accomplished in my transition and with all I have been able to give to other transmen I am so comfortable with myself. The truth is always the best way to success & a happy life. Bumps and scrapes may cause us pain but our truths are what make us who we are, take pride and self-love in your truth.  Cohen My birth name means bound in chains. A year after I legally changed my name (about two years after I came out as trans) I broke the chains that had been on me through this tattoo. Its a chain of grass and feathers for the freedom I have gained through transitioning. I also have moon phases and an elephant. The elephants name is Milton! I got the moons for my 4 year top surgery anniversary. I was told when I was younger and transitioning that it was just a phase. The moon has phases, and no one ever questions that! Ive always felt very connected to the moon, and I wanted to hold that close to my heart as I move forward. I get tattoos as a way to cope and celebrate life events. The dandelion celebrated a year of being out of an inpatient hospital, and now that experience is four years behind me. The heart and flowers is a way to celebrate my identity and pieces of myself that have been told they are hard to love.  June, a queer trans femme with a lot of tattoos! I got this tattoo when I was around 6 months on T, because I was going through a rough patch: my family wasnt talking to me. I had come out about three months before, and I found myself having to find my own strength. Trying to live without fear was my motto at that time, so I wanted to get a tattoo that evoked this. Since Im half-Persian, it was important to include part of my culture in the tattoo. After searching online, I found this phrase in Farsi online. It was the perfect match, and translates to do not fear. My tattoo serves as a daily reminder to live without fear and stay strong.  Tony View this image  I got this tattoo a few months after starting testosterone in 2014. It reads III XXV MMXIV, the day I started T in Roman numerals. Before starting testosterone I was just waiting for my life to start. I got this tattoo so I will always remember the day my life changed because Im finally living.  Alexander View this image  My second tattoo is on my outer forearm. Its an American traditional rat in the crouching panther stance. Most people ask why a rat, and I joke saying its a way to represent Baltimore MD. But really there are multiple reasons. They are smart, they are playful, can survive in just about any environment the list goes on. Other then really wanting a rat tattoo, I feel like the idea of a rat is part of who Ive become while Im transitioning. Ive learned to survive the mental changes Ive gone through so far. Ive survived all the self hate and misgendering Ive gone through with not only family and friends, but at work and during very day life. There are two sides to me and to rats.

aS"For many people, particularly trans women, tucking can be both necessary and life-affirming but theres not a lot of information out there about how to do so safely. Heres what you need to get started. View this image  youtube.com Tucking is a practice, well-known in both trans and drag circles, of putting ones penis between and behind ones legs, so that its not visible from the front of the body. Some people push their testicles back as well, while others move them upward and rest them on the lower part of their abdomen before securing them in place. View this image  hourglassfigure.co.uk View this image  giphy.com There are a number of reasons why trans women tuck: both for our own sense of self, and to influence how others perceive us. For those of us who experience gender dysphoria related to the appearance of our bodies, its a way for us to feel more like our bodies match the gender we feel inside. Tucking also allows us to navigate spaces more safely in female attire, because being identified as trans can sometimes expose us to harassment and violence. So, come to think of it, tucking is really important for many women. View this image  assholegifs.tumblr.com To answer this question and clear up any misinformation, BuzzFeed consulted Dr. Alexandra Hall, a family physician currently at University of Wisconsin, Stout. She has a decade of experience providing health care for transgender individuals on college campuses, and is often asked to speak at conferences and conduct trainings related to transgender health. Dr. Hall believes that while there are health risks associated with tucking, they can be avoided with the proper precautions, so trans women can be safe and tucked at the same time. One major consideration Dr. Hall brings up: Tucking can adversely affect a trans womans fertility. The function of the scrotum is to keep the testicles away from the body, she said, noting that sperm should ideally be cooler than peoples normal body temperature. It will decrease sperm quality and quantity, assuming a trans woman is not on hormones. View this image  teded.tumblr.com For trans women who may still want to have biological children someday, Dr. Hall recommends tucking sparingly, or to consider banking their sperm if they can afford it. Another possible problem that tucking can raise is skin infections. Where you tuck tends to be a warm and moist area, and a place where we sweat a lot, Dr. Hall said. This leaves trans women who tuck regularly at risk for a superficial fungal infection, commonly known as jock itch. In order to avoid skin infections, Dr. Hall said, you want to keep skin cool and dry. Take a break when youre alone or wearing a loose flowy skirt when its not as important to be tucked. View this image  Via storify.com Dr. Hall also recommends over-the-counter anti-fungal powders or creams like Monostat or Nystatin, which are available at any drug store. Other precautions need to be taken depending on the particular methods people choose to secure their genitals once theyre tucked. So before we get to Dr. Halls specific recommendations, lets review the two major tucking methods, as demonstrated by YouTube lovelies Princess Joules and Brooklyn Beauty. In this video, Princess Joules demonstrates how to tuck using tape. First, its important to shave or wax your pubic hair to prevent pain when pulling the tape out. Second, she emphasizes that the penis must be soft at the start of the process. View this image  youtube.com (Well, not literally; Princess Joules points out that the penis should be as soft as overcooked ramen). Now to the tape: while other tuckers use various types of tape, Princess Joules has one important recommendation: View this image  youtube.com According to Princess Joules: Sports tape does the job because it can go on your skin, unlike other tape, which is not designed for skin and can be more painful or irritating. After wrapping the penis in a piece of tissue paper, Princess Joules suggests taking a long strip of tape and applying it to the penis: View this image  youtube.com You should leave a long strip to pull back between the legs and up the butt crack. Then, Princess Joules recommends putting a short piece of tape around the penis. View this image  youtube.com After pulling the long strip of tape back between your legs and up your crack to the small of your back, Princess Joules recommends using two more long pieces of tape to secure the whole business in place. With this method, Princess Joules is able to go out in form-fitting clothes and even wear bikinis without being worried that her tuck will become undone. You may know it as a pretentious word for a mishap or accident, but thats not what Brooklyn Beauty means when she demonstrates her tucking method in this video. She starts by cutting the elastic top off some pantyhose, then cuts off the top of a sock. youtube.com youtube.com She then puts the sock through the pantyhose elastic, and voila! View this image  youtube.com She then puts her legs through the gaffe, then tucks her penis between her legs and up her crack before putting the gaffe on. View this image  youtube.com With this method, Brooklyn is also able to wear tight clothes and swimsuits without being worried about her tuck getting undone. The answer is that it depends. Dr. Hall believes that Taping gives you more control in terms of giving a really precise appearance and making sure everything remains exactly in place. This is useful for high-stakes situations where a secure tuck is of the essence, or if the exact appearance of that area is something a trans woman is worried about, like if theyre wearing a skin-tight dress where their pubic region is highly visible. Theres just one problem: View this image  youtube.com Because taping takes time, and you have to undo and re-do the process every time you pee, people who tape usually dont pee while theyre tucked. According to Dr. Hall, this can lead to a number of problems. Delayed urination increases your risk of getting a urinary tract infection, though the risk is lower when you have a long urethra, as people with penises do. And even though theres also a risk of bladder or even kidney damage, Dr. Hall said the likelihood of this is remote because people usually cant voluntarily hold it in long enough for that to happen. However, theres a less severe but more common effect of needing to go for long periods without peeing dehydration. View this image  riffsy.com Youre drinking less fluids and youre walking around dehydrated a lot of the time, Dr. Hall noted about trans women who dont want to pee while theyre tucked. For most people, if you dont have medical problems your body can handle it. But it can make you more tired, or prone to getting headaches. Other issues that can develop with taping involve skin reactions. When you rip the tape off, some of your skin comes with it; that can be irritating over time. Dr. Hall thinks this is a problem even with the use of sports or surgical tape, but she endorses something that our YouTube star also recommends: View this image  youtube.com Dr. Hall also suggests wrapping the penis either in a baby wash cloth or cutting up underwear, because cotton may be even better for reducing friction and preventing chafing. So in the end, even though taping provides more control and possibly a more streamlined appearance, using a gaffe is less likely to result in health issues as a result of tucking. So whats a fabulous tucking trans woman to do? Dr. Hall thinks the most sensible solution is to use both methods. Just do a gaffe most of the time, she recommends, and then if you really need it, use tape. Remember: View this image  giphy.com   Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .

Police were called to the home of Shehada and his wife on March 29, after several 911 calls were made. Officers discovered the body of Amir outside the North Hills home and Shehadas wife dead inside. An investigation into the death of Shehadas wife is ongoing. Shehada had previously told police he found his dead wife in the bathroom of their home and that his son had threatened him with a knife, The Los Angeles Daily News reported. Police told the Daily News that no knife was found, but the mothers body had stab wounds. Shehada had allegedly threatened to kill his son on prior occasions because he was gay, the DA said. Shehada is being held without bail and faces life in prison if convicted. The Los Angeles LGBT Center condemned the killing in a post on Facebook. Despite all the civil rights victories weve had in the last few years, we still live in a society where people face violence or even murder for being open about their sexual orientation or gender identity, center staff wrote. On Amirs Facebook profile, he wrote an emotional post about feeling as if his parents controlled him. If there are any good people on this earth, please help free me from this inhumane slavery, he wrote.

aS"Last week, NHS England said it wouldnt provide the drug that blocks HIV because its not responsible for doing so. But who is? BuzzFeed News went in search of answers. Facebook / Will Nutland The Department of Health still cant say which public body is responsible for providing the drug that protects people from contracting HIV, more than 10 days after NHS England sparked a furore by announcing it would not provide it. Despite being asked a total of 11 times by BuzzFeed News who was responsible, and despite being shown a leaked letter from the public health minister that suggested who was responsible, a DoH spokesperson was unable to provide an answer. NHS England stunned HIV charities on 21 March when it said it would not be making the medication brand name Truvada widely available as it wasnt its responsibility. Charities condemned the decision as shameful, adding that the drug could prevent thousands of people from contracting the virus. But NHS England, which said instead that it would give the medication to 500 people in test sites around the country, claimed it could not offer the drug more widely as it was the responsibility of local authorities to do so. The two main organisations representing local authorities, however, said offering it widely was not councils responsibility and that in fact, it was NHS Englands. The issue has been stuck in this stalemate since. NHS England DoH The row hinges on whether the drug constitutes HIV medication or HIV prevention. HIV medication is the responsibility of NHS England, while HIV prevention is the responsibility of local authorities. Truvada, however, is an antiretroviral drug. This means that it is used in the treatment of people who are already HIV-positive, in combination with other drugs. But on its own it is also used to prevent HIV, in a regime known as PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis. It is therefore both an HIV treatment and an HIV prevention. In a further twist, NHS England also provides Truvada for people who have recently been exposed to HIV in order to stop the virus taking hold a prevention method known as PEP: post-exposure prophylaxis. Earlier this week, an email from Jane Ellison MP, the public health minister, to Rushanara Ali MP who had asked for clarity on the issue was passed to BuzzFeed News by a source. Ellison wrote in the letter, just three weeks before NHS Englands announcement: NHS England commissions HIV treatment services, including antiretroviral drugs, irrespective of how they are used. Local authorities are responsible for commissioning HIV prevention services. The letter continues: An impact assessment is being completed to determine the impact not only for NHS England of funding the drugs but also for local authorities, given their role in commissioning HIV prevention. Ellison added: NHS England has set up a Policy Working Group (PWG) to develop a policy proposition for the commissioning of PrEP. DoH DoH But when BuzzFeed News put the contents of the letter to the Department of Health, asking who was responsible for providing PrEP NHS England or local councils the response, initially, was this statement: NHS England will be running a number of test sites to use antiretroviral drugs to prevent the spread of HIV. These test sites will seek [to] show how PrEP could be commissioned in the most cost effective and integrated way to reduce HIV and sexually transmitted infections in those at highest risk. Since this response did not answer the question posed, BuzzFeed News telephoned the DoH to ask again. The first time we asked who was responsible for providing the drug, a spokesman said: The line I sent you is all I can say at the moment. So we asked again, suggesting that the department must know the answer as for the last 18 months NHS England has been discussing the commissioning of the drug with a range of interested bodies, giving the impression to HIV organisations that NHS England was responsible. An NHS England circular, revealed by BuzzFeed News last week, states: NHS England is the responsible commissioner for all antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), including where they are used in HIV prevention. And while NHS England now claims it is not responsible, we pointed out that local councils dispute this and Ellisons letter said NHS England was responsible for commissioning antiretrovirals in all circumstances. The spokesman replied: All I can say at the moment is that these issues youre talking about are being worked through. But surely, we suggested, someone must know currently who is responsible for commissioning these drugs. That is something that is being worked through, repeated the spokesman. BuzzFeed News asked yet again specifically, who has legal responsibility given that NHS England already provides PEP (the post-exposure prevention treatment) and local councils do not commission any other drugs. View this image  Justin Sullivan / Getty Images The responsibility, or how the programme will be implemented, and who will be implementing it, which is the same thing as who has responsibility for it, all of these issues are currently being worked through, replied the spokesman. I dont have any more information than that. BuzzFeed News asked for the sixth time. Prevention is the responsibility of local authorities, treatment is the responsibility of the NHS, but what were doing at the moment is nailing down where this [PrEP] will sit, said the DoH representative. So, we asked, does the Department of Health not know who is responsible for commissioning PrEP? Its not about saying we dont know who is responsible, its about a process of work is going on to to determine how the programme will look and who will be commissioning it began the spokesman. And in the meantime, the department does not have a position on who is responsible? We cant have a position till weve worked it through, said the spokesman. So if there were a legal challenge to NHS Englands decision, asked BuzzFeed News, the department could not say whether NHS England was indeed responsible? At the moment I cant say what wed say, he replied. View this image  Facebook After 10 attempts, BuzzFeed News suggested it was unusual for the department not to have an answer as to who is responsible for funding a drug. I can only tell you what Ive told you, the spokesman replied. Theres a piece of work ongoing to determine who will be the responsible commissioner for this. I hope that wont take too long. Deborah Gold, the chief executive of the National Aids Trust, told BuzzFeed News she was staggered the government did not know who was responsible. Its extraordinary and unacceptable that 18 months after the NHS started looking at how to commission PrEP it still doesnt know the answer to that question, she said. With every passing day people are at risk of getting HIV that could be prevented if only they had access to PrEP. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .

aS"The Supreme Court foreclosed litigation over laws interfering with the right to marry and rights and responsibilities intertwined with marriage, a federal judge ruled Thursday. View this image  Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant Rogelio V. Solis / AP WASHINGTON A federal judge in Mississippi on Thursday afternoon halted enforcement of the states ban on same-sex couples adopting children. Citing the U.S. Supreme Courts 2015 decision ending bans on same-sex couples marriages, U.S. District Court Judge Daniel P. Jordan III granted a preliminary injunction against the states Department of Human Services in a case filed this past August. Of the Supreme Courts decision, Jordan wrote, [T]he majority opinion foreclosed litigation over laws interfering with the right to marry and rights and responsibilities intertwined with marriage. Jordan concluded on Thursday: The majority of the United States Supreme Court dictates the law of the land, and lower courts are bound to follow it. In this case, that means that [the adoption ban] violates the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. The case was brought by same-sex couples seeking to adopt through the foster care system or private adoptions, as well as by the Campaign for Southern Equality and the Family Equality Council. They snagged Roberta Kaplan as their lead attorney in the challenge the lawyer who represented Edie Windsor in her successful challenge to the Defense of Marriage Act and then Mississippi same-sex couples who successfully challenged the states same-sex marriage ban. While Jordan did grant their requested preliminary injunction, he also granted the requests made by many of the defendants to be removed from the lawsuit. Jordan granted requests to dismiss the complaint against Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant, Attorney General Jim Hood, and several judges finding that they were not the appropriate parties to be sued by the couples and groups. The court found, however, that the lawsuit was properly brought against the head of the states Department of Human Services, both as to those seeking adoptions through the foster care process and those seeking private adoptions. The ruling comes less than 24 hours after the states Senate passed a far-reaching religious freedom bill that critics call one of the worst such bills in the country for LGBT people.

aS"Kezia Dugdale has revealed that her partner is a woman. The response could not have been more low key. View this image  Mark Runnacles / Getty Images The leader of the Scottish Labour party has disclosed that she is in a relationship with a woman, making her the fourth LGBT leader of a political party north of the border, but sparking only the tiniest ripple of reaction. Kezia Dugdale, who at 34 is the youngest ever head of Scottish Labour, mentioned this aspect of her life amid an interview about the forthcoming elections and the EU referendum. I have a female partner, she told the Fabian Review. I dont talk about it much because I dont feel I need to. The politician joins Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservative party, Patrick Harvie, leader of the Scottish Green Party, and David Coburn, leader of UKIP Scotland, as out-and-proud LGBT party heads. Scotland is the only country in the world to have a majority of political party leaders who are LGBT. View this image  Jeff J Mitchell / Getty Images Dugdale, who is MSP for the Lothian Region, became leader of the opposition in Scotland last August following the resignation of Jim Murphy. She has only been a Member of the Scottish Parliament since 2011, and, she explained in the interview, it is in part the speed of her success that has informed her desire to be low-key about her personal life. Theres been something too about how meteoric my career has been, she said. I am generally calm, almost serene. I dont get easily stressed or battered. But I need a bit of stability to do that and that means my private life is my private life. Thats the thing I just have to have that nobody gets to touch, and that gives me the strength to be calm elsewhere. Dugdales disclosure did not make the headline of the article, has scarcely been mentioned by national newspapers, and on social media there was significantly more discussion about her stance on Scottish independence. There were, however, some tweets congratulating Dugdale even from SNP supporters. Brilliant that @kezdugdale has come out, and #LGBT leadership in politics has taken another step forward:   https://t.co/tbJXBHoCBS @kezdugdale Good on you for coming out. Wonderful to see 3 of our 5 main party leaders be LGBT. Good luck with the election. Congratulations and respect to @kezdugdale on publicly stating she has a female partner. Scottish politics needs more LGBT+ role models. Well done @kezdugdale for coming out abt yr female partner. Great to hv another public LGBTI role model fr Scotland. https://t.co/YVHAWAwbHP Dugdale acknowledged the congratulatory tweets in a tweet of her own first thing this morning.

aS'The landmark procedures will mean more organs available for HIV-positive patients. View this image  Dr. Dorry Segev and Dr. Niraj Desai inspect a kidney during a transplant. Brendan Smialowski / AFP Doctors from Johns Hopkins Medicine announced Wednesday that they had performed the worlds first HIV-positive liver transplant, as well as the first HIV-positive kidney transplant in the U.S. Both organs were donated by the same deceased HIV-positive donor to two patients currently living with HIV. The successful procedures open the door to other HIV-positive patients who often suffer organ complications either because of the virus or because of the available treatments to fight it to have an additional lifeline to consider when placed on crowded waiting lists for organ donations. For those living with HIV this is a very exciting time, Dorry Segev, director of the Epidemiology Research Group in Organ Transplantation at Johns Hopkins, said at a news conference. Now every HIV-positive donor is potential lives saved. The transplants were only made possible after President Barack Obama signed the HIV Organ Policy Equity (HOPE) Act into law in 2013, opening the door to medical facilities performing transplants using organs obtained from HIV-positive donors. Prior to that, a 1988 amendment to the National Organ Transplant Act had banned research into HIV-positive transplantation during a time when public fears around AIDS were high. At that time, it made sense because HIV/AIDS was a deadly disease, Segev said. But our ability to treat and control this disease has progressed rapidly in the last few decades. Segev, who helped write the HOPE Act, noted that roughly 122,000 Americans are on the transplant waiting list at any given time. His research team determined that if the door was opened to HIV-positive transplants, 300500 HIV-positive donors would be available every year for about 1,000 individual transplants. It occurred to us that there were thousands of patients with HIV in need of transplants who were waiting on waiting lists and suffering high rates of dying while waiting for these organs, Segev said. At the same time, we were throwing away organs from HIV-positive patients. Both of the patients who underwent the recent surgeries are in good condition, with their donated organs functioning well, said Christine Durand, assistant professor of Medicine and Oncology at Johns Hopkins Medicine. Both individuals have been living with HIV for several decades. The most important risk to note in HIV-positive transplants is that the recipient will be exposed to a second strain of HIV from the donor, Durand noted. This means that doctors will have to consider whether they will be exposed to strains with drug resistance and match the recipient accordingly. Sigev and his group have assembled a consortium of roughly 30 medical facilities across the country who currently perform HIV negative-to-positive transplants that might have the capabilities to expand to their HIV positive-to-positive protocols. Once the procedures are taken up across the country, more organs will be available overall. This is an advancement that will affect everyone on the donor waiting list, including those with HIV, Durand said. CORRECTION This was the first HIV-positive kidney transplant to occur in the U.S. A previous version of the story implied that it was the first-ever HIV-positive kidney transplant.

aS" View this image  AP / Rogelio V. Solis Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant on Tuesday signed into law what critics say is the most sweeping anti-LGBT legislation in the United States, permitting the denial of products and services in a wide range of venues. The Republican governor said he enacted the law to protect the sincerely held religious beliefs and moral convictions of individuals, organizations, and private associations. Attempting to rebut criticism from LGBT advocates and Democrats who had urged him to veto the measure Bryant added the law does not strip anyones existing rights. I have signed House Bill 1523. Full statement: House Bill 1523 protects individuals, religious organizations, and certain businesses who take actions due to their religious objections to same-sex marriage or any sex outside straight marriage. It also protects those who object to transgender people. The bill says they could not face government retribution if they were acting based on sincerely held religious beliefs. In addition, it covers those who decline for reasons of faith to provide counseling services, foster care, and adoption services even, apparently, those receiving government funding. Clerks who issue marriage licenses could also recuse themselves. Republican backers argued their legislation fixes problems created for people of faith when the Supreme Court ruled for marriage equality last year. Existing Mississippi law does not protect people from discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation however, the law previously did not provide explicit protection for those who do discriminate. This is probably the worst religious freedom bill to date, Ben Needham, director of Project One America, an LGBT advocacy project in the Deep South run by the Human Rights Campaign, told BuzzFeed News. Needham and other critics have argued the legislation explicitly allows the denial of services, goods, wedding products, medical treatment, housing, and employment to LGBT people. This is the most hateful bill I have seen in my career in the legislature, Rep. Stephen Holland said last week, urging his colleagues to stop the bill. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. You are doing nothing but discrimination. However, the Republican-dominated Mississippi House of Representatives voted 7047 on Monday to send the bill to the governor. Crowds gather at #NoHateInOurState #HB1523 rally In speeches on the Senate floor Wednesday night, Republicans said the law was needed for Christians. It gives protection to those in the state who cannot in a good conscience provide services for a same-sex marriage, Sen. Jennifer Branning said in an address to her colleagues. I dont think this bill is discriminatory, she continued, saying the bill instead protects the rights of Christians from government retribution if they oppose same-sex couples getting married. It takes no rights away from anyone. But Democrats fiercely contend the new law is overly broad, specifically encouraging discrimination against LGBT people in numerous settings, thereby inviting backlash that other states, including North Carolina, have faced for passing laws targeting LGBT people. The Mississippi law was enacted weeks after North Carolina passed a law that targets LGBT rights and Georgias governor vetoed a religious protection bill under pressure from corporations threatening to pull business from the state. The Mississippi legislation combines elements of lightning-rod Religious Freedom Restoration Acts (which restrict government from burdening exercise of faith) and First Amendment Defense Acts (which protect people opposed to same-sex couples marrying). This would be a new type of bill out there, Needham said before the bill was signed. The 13-page measure prohibits the government from discriminating against a person and certain organizations for acting on their religious convictions. It defines person broadly including sole proprietorship, or closely held company, partnership, association, organization, firm, corporation, cooperative, trust, society or other closely held entity. The government also could not penalize a religious organization for denying housing, employment, or services. View this image  LGBT advocates protested in the Mississippi capitol. AP / Rogelio V. Solis The law further protects those providing photography, poetry, videography, disc-jockey services, wedding planning, printing, floral arrangements, dress making, cake or pastry, artistry, wedding-venue rentals, limousine, car-service rentals, jewelry sales and services, or similar marriage-related services. It also protects those who believe sexual relations are properly reserved to opposite-sex marriages, and that being male or female is objectively determined by anatomy and genetics at time of birth. It goes on to cover those enforcing sex-specific policies for employee or student dress or grooming, or concerning access to restrooms, showers, dressing rooms, or locker rooms. It also protects those who decline treatments, counseling, or surgeries related to sex reassignment or gender-identity transitioning or decline to participate in psychological, counseling, or fertility services. The law provides an exception for medical emergencies. In defining discriminating, the law says government could not fine, withhold loans, give bad grades, refuse to hire, or take dozens of other retaliatory acts against individuals acting on their faith. It is very broad and very dangerous, said Erik Fleming, the director of advocacy and policy for the ACLU of Mississippi, who also served for 11 years in the state House. It basically sanctions religious discrimination. It is reminiscent of what happened 50 or 60 years ago in this same state, Fleming told BuzzFeed News. People say that it is just religious, but there were people who had a religious belief that black and white people should be segregated, and youre opening that Pandoras box again. Democratic Sen. John Horhn had warned about repeating that history. Why does this keep happening to Mississippi? Why do people keep thinking so badly of us? he said in a speech to fellow lawmakers. This is one of them, he said. Its House Bill 1523 before us. They say its about same-sex marriage. If thats the case, why does it include adoptions? Then why does it allow discrimination in medical services? The reason we are so adamantly opposed to it is because we have already been there. Ladies and gentleman, we dont need to pass this legislation. We dont need to put another stain on Mississippi.  View this embed  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Following a lawsuit against the state by national LGBT groups, Attorney General Roy Cooper called the law a national embarrassment. View this image  WRAL / Via wral.com North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper announced Tuesday that he would not defend a recently passed state law that nullified local LGBT rights ordinances, saying it was unconstitutional. On Monday, a collection of state and national LGBT and anti-discrimination groups filed the lawsuit against the state, arguing that a recently passed law part of which restricts transgender peoples access to public restrooms that correspond with their gender identity singled out LGBT people for disfavored treatment and explicitly [writes] discrimination against transgender people into state law. Speaking at press conference in Raleigh, the state capital, Cooper called the law a national embarrassment, and argued that it was not only unconstitutional but a drain on North Carolinas economy, due to the increased litigation that will be waged against the state, as well as the negative effects on small businesses. Over the last 15 years our office has defended state officials and agencies when [they] have been sued, the Democratic attorney general said. We will continue to do this, but we will not defend the constitutionality of this bill. He said his office would have nothing to do with this. Cooper explained that on top of the prior reasons listed for not supporting the bill, it also went directly against a nondiscrimination policy that was instated in his office in 2001. I made a promise, Cooper said about the policy, that any employee who gets the job done here should be welcome without fear of discrimination. House Bill 2 is in direct conflict with our policy. Here's North Carolina state employee nondiscrimination policy AG said prevented him from defending anti-LGBT law: Toward the end of the press conference, Cooper who is currently running for governor himself rebuked current Republican North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory for not vetoing the bill, and encouraged the governor to repeal it. Cooper also commended Georgias conservative Republican governor, Nathan Deal, who on Monday vetoed a Religious Liberty Bill that enabled legal discrimination against LGBT citizens, citing the negative affects it would have on Georgias economy. Considering what is happening, I believe I must now call and work with the legislature to repeal [H.B.2], Cooper concluded. Its time to do the right thing for the good of our people, our economy, and our state. Shortly after Coopers statements, the LGBT groups behind the lawsuit against North Carolina praised the Attorney General for refusing to defend the state. Were grateful the Attorney General stands on the right side of history with the many cities, states, businesses, and individuals who have come out against this harmful measure, the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of North Carolina, Equality NC, and Lambda Legal, said in a statement. 2.

aS"Seamus Johnston had sued the University of Pittsburgh in federal court, claiming that banning him from the male locker room violated his Constitutional and civil rights. View this image  Seamus Johnston Photo courtesy of Transgender Law Center A transgender man and his former university settled a lawsuit that argued the school violated his rights by banning him from male locker rooms, both parties announced Tuesday. The case is one of at least four federal lawsuits in the United States that argues that Constitution and civil rights laws entitle transgender students access to school restrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their gender identity together, they form a sort of legal counterpoint to high-profile state legislative efforts, such as those in North Carolina and Tennessee, to ban trans students from those facilities. Seamus Johnston sued the University of Pittsburgh in 2014 for banning him from the locker rooms and eventually expelling him, arguing in U.S. District Court in Pennsylvania that the school violated Title IX of the Education Act of 1972 and the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. While details of the agreement are confidential, a joint statement describes recent changes the school has adopted concerning transgender students, including rules that allow those students to use school restrooms that correspond with their gender identity. The university also created gender-neutral housing, according to the statement, which added that the school will establish a working group to advise officials on transgender students access to gender-specific spaces that match their gender. This is definitely a victory, Ilona Turner, who is legal director of the Transgender Law Center and one of the lawyers representing Johnston, told BuzzFeed News. The settlement, she said, proves schools can create a win-win situation. The statement does not speak specifically to the issue of locker rooms, but, Turner said in an interview, it does refer to all gender-specific spaces. The debate has escalated in the past couple years over whether existing civil rights laws particularly Title IX guarantee transgender students access to school facilities that correspond with their gender. Title IX bans sex-based discrimination, and both LGBT advocacy groups and the Obama administration have argued it thus bans transgender discrimination as a form of sex discrimination. No student has won such an argument in federal court, however. One case is pending in a district court in Michigan, Tooley v. Van Buren Public Schools. Johnstons case and another case in Virginia, G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board, lost at the U.S. district court. Both Johnston and the Virginia student have taken their cases to federal appeals courts. Citing those two lower-court losses, conservative politicians and advocacy groups have argued bans on sex discrimination do not, in fact, apply to transgender discrimination. But by reaching a settlement, Turner said they have bent the legal arc of toward a win or at least not a loss for transgender students. View this image  AP / Keith Srakocic I think what this case shows is that its just not worth it for schools, Turner said, referring to lengthy court fights. Theres a lot at stake for a school to try and fight these kind of battles, especially publicly, but they are going to get blowback from the federal government, their own students, and the general public who will view them as discriminatory and out of step. In the fall semester of 2011, Johnston was attending University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown. Although he had identified as female when he applied to the school, he lived as a man, had male identification, and enrolled in a male weight-training class. But according to the lawsuit, officials barred him from the male locker room, brought disorderly conduct charges against him, and eventually expelled him. Johnston argued this violated both Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The university countered in court briefs that other students raised privacy concerns about Johnston in the locker room. Further, Johnston had not undergone sex-reassignment surgery, and had a female birth certificate, they said, and as such was still female. The school said Johnston refused to comply with orders to stay out of the male locker room. In March 2015, Judge Kim R. Gibson ruled in the schools favor. Since Title IX allows sex-segregated facilities as a general matter, he found, it was acceptable to mandate that birth sex not gender identity be the sole factor when assigning those single-sex facilities. Thus, the judge wrote in his decision, while Plaintiff might identify his gender as male, his birth sex is female. It is this fact that Plaintiff was born a biological female, as alleged in the complaint that is fatal to Plaintiffs sex discrimination claim. Turner argues that decision and the Virginia decision last summer runs contrary to a growing body of federal court decisions and findings by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the agency that considers workplace discrimination claims, that have found discrimination based on gender is sex-based discrimination. After Johnston appealed the cases to the 3rd Circuit, the parties attempted to negotiate a resolution out of court. The University of Pittsburgh and Seamus Johnston have worked collaboratively to reach a settlement of the lawsuit Mr. Johnston filed against the University in 2013, asserting claims under Title IX and various state laws, the parties announced Tuesday. The University of Pittsburgh has said it will not provide further comment. Transgender Law Centers executive director, Kris Hayashi, tied the settlement to the political debate in state legislatures. Last week, North Carolina enacted a law trying to deny transgender students the right to use facilities consistent with who they are, and other state legislatures have considered similar bills, he said. The fact is, the federal government has clearly ruled that schools must work to meet the needs of all students, including transgender students. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

Rachel Ellen, Facebook I came out as trans* right before high school, and I was also kind of a hot mess, and pretty well known as a freak. People didnt really know what I was and instead of asking, people just made things up or thought of me as weird/gross/to be avoided, and certainly not someone you would date. Junior year I got really fed up with it all, and since I liked a guy, I asked him out for a change. We were dating for a couple weeks before the question of gender came up, and then I realized he hadnt been sure of my gender or sex the whole time, but was dating me anyway, liking me as a person. Explaining my identity to him was the easiest and least threatening time Ive ever come out, and today he and I have been married for over a year. Nick Sherman, Facebook I am very close with my grandma. One year while I was in college, I visited her for a few weeks.

At 10:00pm one night, I typed an unnecessarily long message and I sent it to him. I watched the screen in a silent panic as I saw the delivered go to read at 10:02pm and he began typing, but then he stopped. I heard him coming up the stairs, and he opened my door and said, I dont know what you were expecting me to say, but I dont care who you like. Youre my sister and I love you, and I started crying. After, like, five minutes of him hugging me, he said, Tell me if anyone ever gives you shit for this. I will end them. I love my brother. Madeline Melton, Facebook During Christmas when we were opening presents, my cousin said asking for earring studs was gay, and thats when I accidentally shouted: I LOVE DICK from the kitchen and came out to everyone. My auntie choked on her piece of pie and my grandma said, Thats the fifth one. But they were all really happy. Miguel Hernandez, Facebook So I got the idea to come out to my family via baked goods, cause who can be upset when theres food. So in the middle of the night so that no one would know what I was doing, I began to bake a batch of cupcakes. At first everythings going great, Im being real careful not to be loud and wake anyone, but all of a sudden I realized there were no eggs. Not a problem, a banana could do just fine instead. Things were going great again, until I realized I didnt have enough cocoa, I was beginning to panic just a little bit because it was too late to turn back. I calmed myself down and I just went with it; so what if the cupcakes were only a little chocolaty and tasted a bit like banana? I put them in the oven, I thought after that everything would be fine. I was wrong. I was about to start making some icing when I found out that I had absolutely no icing sugar. I was certain that I was most definitely screwed: How was I supposed to spell Im a lesbian on some cupcakes without any icing? Yet despite this I remained determined. I found out that you can make some makeshift icing sugar with some corn starch and granulated sugar (thanks Google). The icing wasnt really all that icing-like but I didnt really care at that point. But yet again another ingredient was missing, great. I had no food colouring. After some thorough rummaging in the cupboards I found some Kool-Aid mix that had been in the cupboard for who knows how long. In the end I had slightly chocolate and slightly banana flavoured cupcakes with watermelon and strawberry flavoured faux icing. The coming out went great but the cupcakes were nasty no one ate more than one of them. So remember, kids, check that you have all the proper ingredients before you make coming-out cupcakes. kacejac View this image  My mum and I were at the swimming pool and she was checking out the guys by the pool.

So I came back with, Well, I dont want to be left out of the fun. She gave me this look like, What on earth are you talking about? and I went on to explain that even though I was designated female at birth, I identify as a boy, and she was really patient and accepting. Honestly, her biggest qualm was that Im not athletic at all, and if I was going to be left out of the Olympics, it would be because I cant do sports to save my life.

View this image  North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory AP / Ted Richardson Three individuals and two LGBT advocacy groups early Monday morning filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging the recently passed North Carolina law that nullified local LGBT rights ordinances and restricted transgender peoples access to restrooms. By singling out LGBT people for disfavored treatment and explicitly writing discrimination against transgender people into state law, H.B. 2 violates the most basic guarantees of equal treatment and the U.S. Constitution, the lawsuit argues. The complaint argues the law violates peoples equal protection, privacy, and liberty rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and their civil rights under Title IX of the Education Act of 1972. The lawsuit is asking for a declaratory judgment that the law violates the Constitution and Title IX and an injunction against enforcement of the law. The case was filed overnight in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina on behalf of Joaqun Carcao, a transgender man who works at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill; Payton Grey McGarry, a transgender man who is a student at the University of North Carolina-Greensboro; and Angela Gilmore, a lesbian who is the associate dean for academic affairs at North Carolina Central University. Also named as plaintiffs are the ACLU of North Carolina and Equality North Carolina. The defendants include Gov. Pat McCrory, Attorney General Roy Cooper, and the University of North Carolina and several of its senior officials. The lawsuit was assigned to Judge Thomas D. Schroeder, who was appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush. The American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of North Carolina, Lambda Legal, and Equality North Carolina are all backing the litigation. On March 23, Republican state legislators convened a one-day legislative session to pass House Bill 2 with the explicit goal of overriding an ordinance in Charlotte. The city ordinance would have protected LGBT people from discrimination in housing and public accommodations. McCrory, Republican legislative leaders, and Christian conservatives had claimed the public accommodations portion of the Charlotte ordinance posed a safety threat by allowing transgender women whom they called men to prey on women and girls, especially in bathrooms. To negate the citys ordinance, the new North Carolina law decrees that local jurisdictions may not extend protections to classes of people not already covered by the state. The state law approved Wednesday provides equal access to public accommodations based on various characteristics including race, religion, color, and biological sex. However, the law omits coverage based on sexual orientation or gender identity and specifies that designating bathrooms based on biological sex is not discrimination. The lawsuit argues that the new law denies LGBT people equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment because the new law was designed to single LGBT people out for discrimination and less protection. H.B. 2 was motivated by an intent to treat LGBT people differently, and worse, than other people, including by stripping them of the protections afforded by the City of Charlottes Ordinance and precluding any local government from taking action to protect LGBT people against discrimination, the lawsuit alleges. By doing so, it continues, H.B. 2 imposes a different and more burdensome political process on LGBT people than on non-LGBT people who have state protection against identity-based discrimination. The new state law also mandates that single-sex restrooms and locker rooms in public schools and government buildings only be used only by those who have a corresponding sex listed on their birth certificate. In detailing the consequences of these provisions, the lawsuit states, The only restrooms on the floor where Mr. Carcano works at UNC-Chapel Hill are designated either for men or for women. There are no restrooms in the building where Mr. Carcano works that are not designated either for men or women. All the restrooms in the building are multiple occupancy. The lawsuit continued: If Mr. Carcano could not use the mens restroom at UNC-Chapel Hill, he would have to leave campus and find a local business in order to use the mens restroom; or he would have to locate a restroom not designated for either men or women elsewhere on campus. The lawsuit argues that the new law violates the rights of transgender people under the Constitution and existing civil rights laws because it denies those students access to school facilities that reflect their gender identity. H.B. 2s discrimination against transgender people based on sex is not substantially related to any important government interest, the lawsuit argues in discussing the constitutional claim. Indeed, it is not even rationally related to any legitimate government interest. It also asserts that the law violates Title IX as to Carcao and McGarry. For example, the lawsuit alleges that the law denies McGarry the benefits of, and subjects him to discrimination in educational programs and activities at Defendants constituent campus, UNC-Greensboro, on the basis of sex a violation of Title IX. Under President Obama, federal agencies have interpreted Title IX which bans discrimination in publicly funded schools on the basis of sex to ban transgender discrimination as a form of sex discrimination. While some individual school districts have fought back against the federal interpretation of the law, North Carolina is the first state to enact a law banning transgender students from school restrooms that correspond with their gender identity. The lawsuit also alleges two additional constitutional violations regarding the biological sex bathroom restrictions of the law: first, a violation of the plaintiffs right to privacy; and, second, a violation of the plaintiffs right to liberty and autonomy in the right to refuse unwanted medical treatment. Within hours of House Bill 2s passage, it was signed into law by McCrory leading to demonstrations in front of the governors mansion and outcry from corporations, which stated that the law was designed to allow LGBT discrimination. The states attorney general, Cooper, is charged with defending the state in any litigation but already has denounced the new law. That North Carolina is making discrimination part of the law is shameful, said Cooper, a Democrat who also is running for governor. It will not only cause real harm to families, but to our economy as well. In the 17 states and 225 cities with laws banning LGBT discrimination, there are no known instances of the rules being used to defend or facilitate predatory behavior in bathrooms or locker rooms. In response to the growing backlash, McCrory issued a statement on Friday defending the law. North Carolina is one of at least 37 states like Virginia where cities and towns cannot pass rules or regulations that exceed the authority given to them by the state, said the governors press release. In passing the bathroom ordinance, Charlotte was exceeding its authority and setting rules that had ramifications beyond the City of Charlotte.

aS"I feel so grateful, and I hope that I can open doors for other trans guys. View this image  Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News  When 29-year-old Benjamin Melzer, the first transgender man to be on the cover of the German edition of Mens Health, stopped by BuzzFeed News for a chat, he brought along his mom Margret. Soft-spoken and low-key, Melzer doesnt demand attention until he gets in front of a camera, where he somehow feels at home. Modeling, standing in front of the camera is so my thing. It doesnt feel like work. I just love it, Melzer said. I dont care if its all day long and if its exhausting, if Im freezing I just love it. It feels right for me. Melzer grew up near Cologne, Germany, knowing early on that he felt like a boy. Since I was little, I looked up to cover models, like being on Mens Health or GQ, like really masculine men with good bodies, good physiques. Yet he also felt like the ideal those men represented were out of reach for him, until he started medical transition at 24. Through hard work at the gym, he found his own body resembling those men. And eventually, he started doing some amateur modeling. View this image  Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News The first time I was in front of a camera, that gave me the feeling of, This is where you belong, this is what youre born for, and this is what you need to do. So when he heard that Aydian Dowling was a finalist for the Mens Health cover contest in the United States last year, he decided to enter the same contest in Germany. He won an online audience vote to be one of the guys considered for the cover, and went on to a final casting where he met 19 others who were up for the same gig. Eventually, he was chosen to be one of five guys to appear on the cover of the magazines collectors edition. View on Instagram instagram.com Melzer expressed a lot of satisfaction about being shown as just one among a group of guys. Thats what I want [being trans] to be, just normal. We dont have a choice, and it just is the way it is, and we can make the best of it, he said. View this image  Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Growing up in a family that didnt force him to dress in a feminine way allowed Melzer to come to terms with being trans without a lot of turmoil. He was able to present himself as masculine in school, and ended up dating a woman he knew from college, after they met up five years ago, a month after his first testosterone shot. But for her, I always looked and acted like a boy, Melzer said. It was just the body. And I was on my way to fix that. His girlfriend, who identifies as straight and had dated only cisgender men before Melzer, told him that he didnt have to go through the whole process and get bottom surgery, but it was Melzers choice to proceed. Its an operation that the German government requires health insurance companies to cover. View this image  Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Having transitioned to have a face and body that few people would be able to distinguish from cisgender men, Melzer remains open about being transgender, both in his career and with people he encounters in his day-to-day life. Theres a trainer at the gym, a coach. We see each other when Im at the gym, and shes always talking to me, were good with each other. Shes like, Hey, what happened to your arm? Melzer has a large rectangular scar on his forearm from where skin was grafted for his surgery. Sometimes I say, None of your business but this time I was so me, I really wanted to tell her. So I did, and her reaction was, What? Really? Are you kidding me? And shes so interested in it, and shes so curious, and now shes proud to know me. View this image  Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News At the same time, Melzer is also aware that not everyone has the privilege of being able to choose when to come out to people as trans, or a body thats celebrated in mens magazines. Not everybody has to look like me, he said. I think we all have beauty inside. Thats what counts at the end of the day. Melzer also tries to motivate and give tips to other trans men through his social media channels. A lot of people say, Youre my hero, I look up to you, but at the end of the day you have to look in the mirror because the heros standing right in front of you, he said. View this image  Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Melzers goal is to be a full-time male model, and he has one specific fantasy job in mind. My life goal would be to appear in a Calvin Klein commercial, not wearing anything but boxer shorts or briefs, he said. Melzer got closer to that goal on his trip to New York, where he was shot by celebrity photographer Mark Saliger for an upcoming project. Hes had almost everybody in front of his camera. I mean, Charlize Theron, shes one of the most beautiful women in the world. Brad Pitt I love Brad Pitt. I wanna be Brad Pitt! I feel so grateful, Melzer said, and I hope that I can open doors for other trans guys who would love to work in the modeling business.

aS"Thirty years before Carol, there was Donna Deitchs genre-defying Desert Hearts. BuzzFeed News caught up with Deitch in London to revisit the directors classic lesbian love story. Helen Shaver and Patricia Charbonneau in Desert Hearts For anyone whos frantically googled How do I know if Im a girl who likes girls??? within the past 10 years, the Gay & Lesbian section of Netflix is an all-too-familiar place. A sizable percentage of those searchers likely found the affirmation they were looking for after streaming Donna Deitchs 1985 lesbian romance Desert Hearts. Three decades after it was made, this particular lesbian romance about Vivian, a 35-year-old English professor from New York who, in 1959, temporarily relocates to a ranch in Reno for a quickie divorce, then meets a wild-hearted younger woman named Cay still resonates, particularly with a new generation of viewers. The film, which is based on the novel Desert of the Heart by Jane Rule, has experienced a spirited second life, spurred by streaming options like Netflix and Amazon Prime. Young women make fan cuts on YouTube, reblog GIF sets on Tumblr, and reach out to the director, Deitch, with their stories. This week, Desert Hearts returned for a special screening in 35 mm at BFI Flare: Londons LGBT Film Festival. When Flare (formerly known as the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival) launched in 1986, Desert Hearts was on its starting slate, at a time when lesbian stories were barely getting made, let alone being seen by mainstream audiences. People will come up to me after screenings at festivals, Deitch told BuzzFeed News over coffee at the BFI Southbank theater. They say, Can I just tell you what happened to me after I saw Desert Hearts? I came out after that. At this weeks screening, she announced that shes going to start asking people to record their revelations. So many people have been telling me these stories over the years I decided it was time I start collecting them. These days, coming out epiphanies can likely be attributed to a wide variety of pieces of pop culture. In the post-Ellen era, theres no longer a dearth of lesbian storytelling in film and television see: The L Word, Orange Is the New Black, et al. Queer people dont need to look quite as long and hard anymore to see a version of themselves reflected onscreen (though LGBT representation still skews white, cis, monosexual, and male). Even as queer characters become more commonplace in media, however, a certain queer storyline remains, frustratingly, rather rare: happy endings. View this image  The Samuel Goldwyn Company When released, Desert Hearts was championed as the first film to depict a lesbian relationship that didnt end in heartache, disaster, or death. It takes place in 1959, far removed from 2016 (and 1985, for that matter), and yet the final scene swells with hope and possibility. While on the divorce ranch, Vivian (Helen Shaver), the stiff, stuffily suited English professor, eventually learns to let her hair down thanks to Cay (Patricia Charbonneau), the free-spirited, pottery-slinging young Nevadan whos looking for more than just another one night stand. Though Cay is confident in her sexuality, Vivian grapples with the standard bouts of uncertainty and repression; shes worried about what her students back in New York might think about her dalliance (as if students in New York are the unlikeliest of people to be totally chill about homosexuality). Cays surrogate mother, Frances (Audra Lindley), who owns the ranch where Vivians staying, is a classic homophobe who stokes Vivians fears and riles Cays defenses. Its a straightforwardly told and uncomplicatedly plotted film so much so that, upon its release, some critics called it unimaginative and overly earnest. The widely praised chemistry between the actors, though, sold many on the production. When Vivian finally softens and allows herself to fall for Cay, lesbian viewers were able to picture perhaps for the first time lives for themselves in which embracing queerness wouldnt automatically condemn them to eternal loneliness and shame. The power of a happy ending hasnt diminished over time. If theres anything to be gleaned from the recent uproar over a lesbians death on the CW show The 100, which was quickly followed by yet another lesbians death on The Walking Dead, its that LGBT fans particularly young ones still yearn for stories of queer love and triumph, and feel that those stories arent told nearly often enough. Todd Haynes critically acclaimed Carol, from 2015, has rocketed toward the top of nearly every Best Lesbian Movie Ever Made list in part because it doesnt reify any tropes about dead or despairing lesbians; the final scene is an optimistic one, just as Desert Hearts was 30 years earlier. Deitch is well aware that lesbian happy endings have been close to nonexistent in commercial cinema. It was my goal to do a lesbian love story that didnt end in a bisexual triangle or a suicide, she said. That was important to me, because that was the movie I wanted to see, you know? You can call that personal, or you can call that political. But if you come from the era that I come from, you think of the personal as being political. And that, I think, holds true through the ages the personal is very much political. View this image  The Samuel Goldwyn Company When Deitch first decided to make the film, there had been some studio interest in Jane Rules Desert of the Heart, to which shed secured the rights. But those same studios werent necessarily interested in hewing closely to the source material. I initially went to a couple [meetings], and I knew it was wrong, she said. They kept talking about changing the ending, about how [Cay and Vivian] couldnt possibly be together. And I thought, Im never gonna make the film that way; thats not the film I want to make. So she set about independently raising $1 million to produce the film; the financing would take her years. Deitch viewed the obstacles that inevitably accompanied the making of a queer movie as, ultimately, advantages. For one thing: Plenty of agents didnt want their clients to be in the film, thinking a lesbian association would destroy the actors careers. Was that an obstacle? In a way, but maybe it all worked out, Deitch said. I couldnt imagine doing any better than who I got. Before Charbonneau and Shaver officially came on board, Deitch had long conversations with the actors about their full-on commitment to the films sex scene. I had to look in their eyes and know that it wasnt just contractual, she said. If there were any doubt or fear or reluctance, I wouldnt have hired them. Its the longest scene in the film (so long that, according to Deitch, her distributor, the Samuel Goldwyn company, asked her to cut it down, even though they didnt have contractual rights to alter the film). And its a scene that comes quite late in the game; by that point in the just-beginning-to-drag narrative, everyone watching is just waiting for the inevitable. After numerous scenes brimming with songs meant to fill the wide Nevada skies by Patsy Cline, Buddy Holly, Johnny Cash Cay and Vivian finally, finally end up alone in a room together, and everything goes quiet. View this image  The Samuel Goldwyn Company The only sounds I wanted were in the room: traffic, church bells, whatever, said Deitch. I didnt want them to have the radio on, nor did I want to have it scored. I just wanted it to be raw. And real. And true to that moment. The resulting few minutes remain one of the most lauded lesbian sex scenes in recent film history. There are no quick, disorienting cuts; no sweeping, dramatic music; no gross, objectifying super-close shots. Its two women moving and breathing together in a room. Its two women fucking, that widely mythologized and fetishized act. And unlike so many lesbian sex scenes (not like were necessarily deluged with options), it was made for women who have sex with other women. Desert Hearts is, overall, a story about women. Refreshingly, while there are a couple male characters similar to but ultimately unlike the 1939 classic The Women, which also takes place in quickie-divorce-enabling Reno, and has no speaking mens roles at all theyre bit parts, more or less insignificant to the plotline. Instead, its the relationships between Cay and her best friend, Cay and Frances, Frances and Vivian, and, of course, Vivian and Cay that drive the story. The women are the ones who matter. While some aspects of the film might not stand the test of time the characters development doesnt extend very far beyond their sexuality and their struggles with homophobia, both internalized and externalized Desert Hearts marks an extraordinarily important moment in queer film history, wherein good sex and coupled happiness for lesbians entered the realm of cinematic possibility, and, by extension, into the lived experiences of so many who have watched it since its release 30 years ago. And that kiss scene in the rain will never, ever get old. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .

aS"Protesters were arrested outside the governors mansion this week, and more corporations, such as Facebook, Apple, and Google, publicly criticized the bill. View this image  People protest outside the North Carolina governors mansion in Raleigh. AP / Emery P. Dalesio Corporations and activists channeled growing fury this week at North Carolina lawmakers who rushed though legislation on Wednesday to repeal LGBT protections and bar transgender people from certain restrooms. Protesters were arrested outside the governors mansion, while tech companies including Facebook, Apple, and Google argued that the new law is designed to allow LGBT discrimination. The NBA suggested that the discriminatory law could compromise plans to host the 2017 All-Star Game in Charlotte. NBA Statement Regarding Legislation Recently Signed Into Law In North Carolina Republican state leaders enacted the law in order to repeal an ordinance in Charlotte that would protect LGBT people from discrimination in housing and public accommodations. At least nine other jurisdictions in the state had similar laws on the books. Gov. Pat McCrory and Christian conservatives claimed the public accommodations portion of the Charlotte ordinance posed a safety threat by allowing transgender women whom they called men to prey on women and girls, especially in bathrooms. But in the 17 states and 225 cities with laws banning LGBT discrimination, there are no known instances of the rules being used to defend or facilitate predatory behavior in bathrooms or locker rooms. On Thursday, protests swelled in front of the governors mansion, where five people were arrested for blocking traffic, WRAL reported. They were booked on charges of impeding the flow of traffic and resisting, delaying, or obstructing officers. youtube.com In response, McCrory defended the new law and blamed others for spin. Standing with North Carolina parents who are worried about the privacy and safety of their children will always be a top priority for the governor, no matter the spin by the media, pundits or politically correct crowd, McCrory said in a statement. Facebook: ForestCityDataCenter Inclusion is one of our core values and we are proud to champion LGBTQ equality in N.

House Bill 2 mandates that state law supersede all local ordinances concerning wages, employment, and public accommodations. It also restricts single-sex public restrooms and locker rooms in publicly run facilities to people with the same sex on their birth certificate. In addition, it bans transgender students from school restrooms that correspond with their gender identity teeing up a potential legal clash with the federal government, which has found that civil rights laws ban transgender discrimination in schools. The American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal are exploring a legal challenge to the law and are seeking potential plaintiffs for lawsuits. The advocacy groups warned that North Carolina could lose billions in federal funds for running afoul of Department of Education rules that ban transgender discrimination in public schools.

aS'The industry peddled its influence in an attempt to kill anti-LGBT legislation. UPDATE: Georgias governor has vetoed the religious liberty bill. View this image  Marvel Studios Hollywood is taking a stand against Georgias anti-LGBT bill. Disney and its subsidiary Marvel Studios pledged Wednesday to halt production in the state if the bill, which would legalize a faith-based refusal of services to LGBT people, becomes law. Disney is currently shooting Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2 outside Atlanta. Netflix which has also shot several projects there, including the upcoming Winona Ryder thriller Stranger Things joined Disney in threatening a boycott Thursday night. A number of companies have released statements denouncing the bill, but have not said that they would move their productions from the state; AMCs The Walking Dead is among them, as are Time Warner (which owns HBO and Warner Bros.), Lionsgate, Sony, NBCUniversal, Discovery, CBS, MGM, and Open Road Films. The new Baywatch movie, starring Dwayne The Rock Johnson and Zac Efron, is currently filming in Savannah. A representative for the studio did not immediately reply to BuzzFeed News request for a comment regarding their stance on the bill. Georgia has a generous tax incentive for filming, which has made it one of the most popular locations for production outside California and New York; film and television production are a robust part of the states economy. There have been several signs that Hollywood will not have to follow through on its boycott threats. On March 3, the governor of Georgia indicated that he would not sign the bill into law. Significantly, Gov. Nathan Deal has also proactively courted Hollywoods in-state spending. Last May, when he was in L.A. to host a reception for producers and studio executives, he lauded the industry to the Los Angeles Times: Its good for Georgia and its good for business, he said. Still, a spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign told BuzzFeed News in an email, Even in light of the governors comments [on refusing to legalize discrimination] we are incredibly concerned and arent taking anything for granted. We continue to urge fair-minded Georgians and business leaders across the country to speak out and call on the governor to veto the outrageous legislation. While the bill reached the governors desk on March 16, the Hollywood outcry was apparently triggered March 24, when the HRCs president, Chad Griffin, called on the industry at its Los Angeles gala to boycott production in the state should Deal sign off on the bill. Between Saturdays gala and Thursday, they gathered 40 signatures of Hollywood bigwigs for an open letter to the governor saying they plan to take [their] business elsewhere if any legislation sanctioning discrimination is signed into state law. Neither Netflix nor Disney responded to BuzzFeed News question as to whether they would refuse to do business in any state that passed anti-LGBT legislation. ABC, which is owned by Disney, is filming a remake of Dirty Dancing in North Carolina, the state that just struck down a Charlotte ordinance that would have allowed transgender people to use the bathrooms that matched their gender identity. Lionsgate, which is producing Dirty Dancing, emailed BuzzFeed News a statement on Friday saying the current production would continue given our obligation to the hundreds of people in the state employed by the production. However, we will be hard pressed to continue our relationship with North Carolina if this regressive law remains on the books. In North Carolina, however, the current governor has not been a strong supporter of keeping production there. Also, in February 2015, Louisiana police booked two men for crimes against nature under an anti-sodomy law that, despite being declared unconstitutional in 2003, is still on the books in the state. Louisiana is another popular state for film productions, although no studio or network has boycotted it. On Twitter, a Georgia senator who supported the bill mocked the Hollywood boycott. He also engaged with people who called him a bigot and an evil moron, suggesting that people who found anti-LGBT legislation repugnant were the real bigots. The Georgia governor has until May 3 to reach a decision. UPDATE On Monday, Georgia governor Nathan Deal vetoed the religious liberty bill, noting it doesnt reflect the character of our state or the character of our people.             BF_STATIC.timequeue.push(function () { document.getElementById("update_article_update_time_8314151").innerHTML = UI.dateFormat.get_formatted_date(\'1459180000\', \'update\'); }); UPDATE This article has been updated with a comment from Lionsgate regarding North Carolina, which you can read below in full: The legislation hastily enacted by the State of North Carolina today is deplorable and discriminatory, and it runs counter to everything we stand for.

aS"A year ago, my roommate a friend and ex-boyfriend Id known for 12 years died in his sleep. I made it through that day one awful, essential step at a time. View this image  Matt Huynh for BuzzFeed News 1. You wake up to your roommate Kevin standing in your doorway, asking if youd gotten the same text from Chriss mom. Its around 10 a.m. on the Monday after the 4th of July. Youre depressed that you havent gotten laid in almost a full year and havent had a date in even longer. Youve been giving serious thought to leaving the city. You are 32 and feeling unhireable and undateable and really great about yourself. You sometimes wear the same sweatpants for a full week. Your roommate is still standing in the doorway staring. 2. You mumble some sort of response to Kevin and check your phone. Chriss mom sent you a text saying she was worried about him. Youve known her as long as youve known Chris for 12 years. When you and Chris dated, you went to his high school graduation with her and his stepfather. For nearly a full year, hed been your third roommate. Hed been ready to move out of New Jersey at the same time you and Kevin were ready to leave Astoria for Brooklyn. 3. Chris always keeps his door closed. You love him but hate living with him and he feels the same way. Youve known each other for so long, you thought youd be able to handle how weird and private he is but, well, you cant. Kevin knocks on his door and yells his name as youre throwing on those sweatpants. You take the five footsteps from your doorway to Chriss and push his door open. 4. You know immediately. Youve seen two other not-in-a-coffin dead bodies before both were on highways in car accidents. Both looked like movie scenes because you were in your car. This is different: His room is hot and smells bad, the air is gross and thick. 5. Kevin starts yelling for Chris to wake up. You call 911. The 911 people talk to you like youre an idiot. How do you know hes dead? You have to try CPR. 6. You tell Kevin theyre telling you to perform CPR. You grab Chriss foot and its cold and hard. Its the worst thing youve ever touched. His toes are completely curled. Theres dried vomit everywhere. You feel yourself watching this all unfold as if youre watching from the ceiling. 7. Hes dead. Hes cold and hard, you say to the person on the other side of the phone. Your stomach is doing flips. Your roommate, your close friend, your ex-boyfriend is lying on a bed, dead, in front of you as your other roommate screams for him to wake up. The 911 guy tells you the police will be there shortly. You grab Kevin and tell him that you both need to get out of the apartment. 8. You hide your weed. It feels like such a stupid thing, but you dont want to deal with being arrested the day your friend died. 9. You and Kevin wait outside for the police. You both probably look insane sitting in the archway of the entrance to your building. Youve never seen Kevin look like this and you hope you never do again. His eyes are puffy and red you feel lightheaded and keep hoping the police will get there. Everyone who passes by stares at you. You wish you were one of the people staring. You see your super. 10. Chris isumdeadandumwere waiting for the, uh, police, you tell your super. Saying those words makes you feel sick. Your super clearly doesnt know what to say. You remember Chris saying he thought the super was really handsome. 11. The police arrive and Kevin cant talk to them. The one officer, before you are even inside the building, asks, Well, was he on drugs? You respond by glaring at him. Another officer says, Can you wait til were inside the apartment! Just keep going. You walk them upstairs, hoping this is all a really mean practical joke. You think about how clich it is to think that. 12. They go in to try and resuscitate you know its pointless. You felt his foot. You keep thinking of his cold, hard foot and his vomit-covered face. You feel sick but know you need to keep it together. They come out of Chriss room and tell you hes gone. You say thank you in response to everything everyone says to you because what the fuck else are you supposed to say? 13. Every. single. god. damned. officer asks you if Chris was a drug addict. Your voice gets shakier and shakier every time you have to explain to them that he wasnt but that he was a diabetic with a pump and you feel like that had something to do with it. You try to remind yourself that they didnt know Chris. They say you cant contact anyone because its an official crime scene not until a detective gets there and rules it not a crime sceneor something. Youre having a hard time paying attention. You brain is hazy and you keep looking over at Kevin, who is bright red and looks so sad that it hurts. 14. The detective gets there and shes wearing a purple dress and a leather jacket. She looks like that one lady from Brooklyn Nine-Nine but you dont watch that show enough to know the characters name. Shes nicer than most of the other people that have asked you if Chris was on drugs but she still asks you. Its nearly 1 p.m. You feel like youre trapped in the apartment. You want to disappear. 15. A co-worker of Chriss shows up. You have no idea who she is. She sees you and Kevin sitting in the stairwell and asks, Is ChrisOK? She is the second person you have to tell. You think about how many more people you will have to tell. 16. You text some of your closest friends and tell them. You ask them to tell everyone else because you cant deal with telling everyone but you still want everyone to know. You dont want people who love Chris finding out through Facebook or something and you know your close friends will handle telling everyone else who needs to know. 17. The detective rules it not a crime scene or something. She asks you to notify Chriss mother. This is the first time you cry. Your body shakes and you cry and youve never felt so pathetic. You beg the detective not to make you call. How can you? How could you tell this woman that her youngest child has died? Youre not built for this. You sit down and sob. Your hands shake as you pull out your phone. Just make sure shes in a safe place before you tell her, the detective tells you. Your brain is spinning and you cant even remember his mothers name Chriss co-worker has to remind you her name is Ellen. 18. You barely say words when you call Chriss mother. Shes at work shes a nurse. You are embarrassed at how well youre not doing. Itsits Chrishe, you start sobbing again. She knows. She starts sobbing. What am I going to do without him? she asks. People are a lot less coherent during these events than movies would lead you to believe. But she knows, without you having to say the words, so you put the detective on the phone so that she can tell Chriss mom all the legal stuff you couldnt, using words you dont quite understand when strung together. 19. The detective leaves she tells you the coroner is very busy but should be there within two hours. You think of that Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode when her mom dies. You think of everyone who said how unrealistic it was that the EMTs would leave Buffy with her mothers body and think of how thats exactly whats happening. Although, they didnt make a random cop wait with Buffy like they are doing with you and Kevin. The cop they leave behind is so big he can barely fit in your tiny kitchen. 20. Kevins father and brother arrive and are waiting for you both at the diner down the street. They live over two hours away and still arrived before the fucking coroner. Kevin goes to the diner to meet them. You notice how gray the sky is. 21. Youre sitting there, shaking, with Chriss co-worker when an older lady comes down the steps. She comes over to you and grabs your shoulder. Papi, I lost my son last year I know this must be so hard for you, she says. She reminds you of your grandma, Panchy. Her Spanglish is comforting. You will make it through this, she says. You look up at her and ask if you can hug her. She says, Of course. You hug her so hard and sob in her arms. Its the first time all day youve felt any sort of comfort. She tells you she lives upstairs and to let her know if you need anything. 22. You go outside to call Chriss ex-boyfriend, who had also been texting you earlier. He was worried they were the on-again, off-again type. You once told Chris, I want you to either marry him or stop getting back with him because youre an over-opinionated garbage person. His ex had lost his mother a year earlier. You are shaking. If you dont do it, who else will? Chriss mom? You call him and are crying. He starts to cry this awful high-pitched cry that makes you feel like the worst human alive. You wish you didnt have to make either of those calls. 23. You call your mother while sitting there. She doesnt answer. You dont leave a voicemail asking her to call you back. 24. You put your head in your hands and sob so hard you feel like you might throw up. Youre having trouble breathing. You kind of hope you drop dead right there so that you can stop feeling like this. 25. You call your dad at work. Your dad is the nicest, most well-meaning guy but hes not equipped to deal with this sort of thing. You sob into the phone and try to tell him everything that happened in between your sobs. He asks if you want him to come get you he asks if youve called your mother yet. You tell him youre gonna try her again. He has no clue what to tell you but he says hes sorry a lot. 26. You cant even cry. You dry-heave, sitting on your stoop. 27. The woman who lives upstairs walks by again. You need water? You want to come stay upstairs with me? If you boys need anything I have a couch you can stay on. I can cook for you. You thank her but say you just need to be alone right now. 28. You call your mother and this time she answers. Shes been through death before she lost her father when you were 3 and every one of her uncles and aunts has passed away. She cries on the phone with you and asks what she can do. You tell her Kevins father is there waiting. 29. Chriss co-worker leaves at some point you dont really remember when. She gives you her contact info and offers you and Kevin a place to stay. 30. You and Kevin wait in the apartment with a police officer for what seems like an unbearable amount of time. Barely anyone says anything. At least theyve stopped asking you if he was a drug addict. 31. You wait. You are waiting. 32. You and Kevin leave to get sandwiches at Subway because you havent eaten all day. You both take maybe three bites of the sandwiches that Kevin paid for. They taste like nothing. 33. The examiner comes. Shes very sweet. Shes not the coroner she does not take the body. But she does examine it and the entire apartment starts smelling like shit because dead bodies release their bowels and the body has probably just been moved, you guess. You go back out into the hallway with Kevin. The examiner tells you it was most likely Chriss diabetes. She tells you he probably passed away two days ago and that this is normal some roommates keep their bedroom doors shut and arent discovered for a full week. She says it was clear he died in his sleep. You dont care if shes lying or not you need to accept this. You accept this. You think about how you were out getting drunk on the 4th of July while Chris lay dead in his bed. 34. Chriss insulin pump starts beeping like crazy no one bothers to turn it off. 35. You remember how loudly Chris was snoring when you left for that 4th of July party two days ago. You wonder if youd woken him if things would be completely different and hed still be here. Your stomach makes noises. 36. You wait more. The beeping never stops. The wind occasionally blows Chriss door open. You are terrified youll have to look at the body again. 37. You think about his toes and how curled up they were. 38. His mother calls you to tell you shes nearby. His mother fucking arrives from two hours away in New Jersey before the coroner does. Kevin went back out to see his dad. You and the officer make awkward eye-contact neither of you want Chriss mother to see the body. 39. You go down to greet Chriss mom and his stepfather at the front door. They have two other random family members with them. One is a teenage girl. You feel embarrassed to be sobbing in front of a teenager. 40. You enter the apartment and the officer talks to them for a bit. 41. Is he still here? Chriss mom asks. You begin to tell her not to go in because you think that no mother should see her child like that but, of course, she goes in. You listen to her scream-cry over his body until you think you might vomit. You go out into the hallway, where the teenage girl is crying. You sit on the ground and sob next to each other. 42. Chriss family leaves within an hour. Youre once again alone in the apartment with the body and a police officer. You have sweat through everything youre wearing. Kevin comes back in and his face is still bright red. 43. The coroner finally fucking arrives. Its 7 p.m. You realize youve now been stuck in the apartment with your ex-boyfriends dead body for over eight hours. 44. The officer tells you both you can wait on the upstairs staircase and hell let you know when the body is removed. 45. You sit on the steps on the floor above your apartment with Kevin. You both sob. You feel hungover from crying so much. Youre dehydrated, you have a pounding headache, and your stomach wont stop making noises. You realize youve spent nearly the entire day thinking in clichs. You think about how youre not Joan Didion you bet shed never think about death with such a dramatic, clich mindset. But, to be fair, you dont love The Year of Magical Thinking the way your other, more literary friends do. 46. The older woman comes out of her apartment and walks halfway down the steps to you both and asks, Are they taking him? You nod yes. She says shes going to say goodbye to him and asks if you want to come with. NonoIve seen enough of the body today, you tell her. 47. Ill say a prayer for him and for you, OK? You cry and thank her. Youre an atheist but really appreciate the gesture. You hold Kevins hand on the steps as you both cry harder than you thought possible. 48. You hear the sounds of a stretcher hitting the sides of the walls. Theyre having trouble getting it out because your hallways are so narrow. 49. The police have you sign some papers. You have no clue what youre signing you just want to get out of that apartment as soon as you can. You and Kevin quickly throw things in two bags in silence and leave the apartment. His father and brother are outside waiting. 50. On the drive back to New Jersey, Kevin falls asleep and you stare out the window. Youre afraid if you fall asleep youll have a dream about Chris.

aS'NHS England announced on Monday that it would not be making the drug that blocks HIV widely available, but its justification is contradicted by its own documents. View this image  Justin Sullivan / Getty Images The reason NHS England gave on Monday for rolling out the drug that prevents HIV to only 500 people appears to be contradicted by statements found in its own documents, BuzzFeed News can reveal. In the announcement earlier this week, which was roundly criticised, NHS England said it would not be making PrEP the treatment regime that blocks HIV infection widely available because: NHS England is not responsible for commissioning HIV prevention services. The statement emphasised that instead, local authorities are the responsible commissioner for HIV prevention services. But details of NHS Englands responsibilities, as set out in an NHS England file from 2015, dispute these assertions, calling into question the basis on which this weeks announcement was made. View this image  NHS England In a circular entitled Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV:clarification of commissioning position, which was sent out to a variety of major interested parties including Public Health England and local authority commissioners NHS England stated: NHS England is the responsible commissioner for all antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), including where they are used in HIV prevention either in preventing mother to child transmission or as post exposure prophylaxis following sexual or occupational exposure to HIV infection (PEP / PEPSE). View this image  NHS England The drug used for PrEP the brand name for which is Truvada is an antiretroviral medication that is also given to some HIV-positive people to suppress the virus. It is also one of the pills used in PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis), the regime that is used for a few weeks following exposure to the virus. PEP, which has been available on the NHS for years, helps reduce the risk of the virus taking hold if someone mistakenly has unsafe sex. When BuzzFeed News asked NHS England to explain why it is that within a few months the organisation said it was responsible for providing antiretroviral drugs and for HIV prevention, before saying the opposite, it did not respond. View this image  Terence Higgins Trust Norman Lamb MP, the former health minister, today weighed in on the furore, by drafting an early day motion calling for a debate in the Commons about NHS Englands decision and demanding that the government intervenes so that the drug is made available for high-risk groups as soon as possible. The motion reads: This House raises serious concerns over the recent decision by NHS England to delay the national roll-out of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV; notes that this decision was made despite overwhelming evidence of the effectiveness of PrEP in reducing infection with HIV in high-risk groups The motion also questions the validity of NHS Englands assertion that it is not responsible for providing PrEP. It adds that the decision to implement a few test sites for 500 people, to monitor the drug further, may be intended to avoid acceptance of responsibility for commissioning HIV prevention treatments rather than local authorities. It emphasises that responsibility for commissioning PrEP should lie with NHS England rather than local authorities. Yesterday, following statements from local authorities who said they neither had the funding to offer PrEP, nor was it their responsibility, BuzzFeed News asked NHS England to respond and a spokesman replied: No further comment. BuzzFeed News has repeatedly asked NHS England for an interview with its chief executive, Simon Stevens, to explain its decision surrounding Mondays announcement, but has been repeatedly denied. Stevens has not given any interviews about the PrEP decision, but earlier this week gave an interview to the BBC about its diabetes prevention programme. A protest against the decision not to make PrEP widely available will be held outside the offices of NHS England next week.  UPDATE An NHS England spokesperson told BuzzFeed News: There is no conflict between the statement from last year. NHS England continues to be the commissioner of ARVs for indications where there is a likelihood of HIV infection due to exposure. It is because NHS England are the commissioner in these cases that consideration was given to the use of ARVs pre-exposure. The determination now made by NHS England is that administering ARVs to individuals who are known not to be HIV+ and not to have been exposed (ie PrEP) is a different form of service and falls outside of our remit.

aS"A new prose poem by 2016 Whiting Award Winner Ocean Vuong about the young, confused loves that haunt us. Please tell me I am not, he said, I am not / a faggot. Am I? View this image   Trevor rusted pick-up & no license. Trevor 15; blue jeans streaked with deer blood. Trevor too fast & not enough. Trevor waving his John Deere hat from the driveway as you ride by on your squeaky Schwinn. Trevor who fingered a freshman girl then tossed her panties in the lake for fun. For summer. For your hands were wet & Trevors a name like a truck revving up in the night. Who snuck out to meet a boy like you. Yellow & nearly nothing. Trevor going 60 through his daddys wheat field. Who jams all his fries into whopper & chews with two feet on the gas. Your eyes closed in the passenger, the wheat a yellow confetti. Three freckles on his nose. Three periods to a boy-sentence. Trevor Burger King over McDonalds cause the smell of smoke on the beef makes it real. Trevor I Like sunflowers best. They go so high. Trevor with the scar like a comma on his neck, syntax of what next what next what next Imagine going so high and still opening that big. Trevor loading the shotgun two red shells at a time. Its kind of like being brave, I think. Like you got this big ole head full of seeds & no arms to defend yourself. His hard lean arms aimed in the rain. When he touches the triggers black tongue, you swear you can taste his finger in your mouth. // Trevor pointing at the one-winged starling spinning in dirt & takes it for something new. Something smoldering like a word. Like a Trevor who knocked on your window at three in the morning, who you thought was smiling until you saw the blade held over his mouth. I made this, I made this for you, he said, the knife suddenly in your hand. Trevor later // on your steps in the grey dawn. His face in his arms. I dont wanna, he said. His panting. His shaking hair. The blur of it. Please tell me I am not, he said through the sound of his knuckles as he popped them like the word But But But. & you take a step back. Please tell me I am not, he said, I am not a faggot. Am I? Am I? Are you? Are you Trevors eyes: the blue shafts in a gutted mine? // Trevor the hunter. Trevor the carnivore, the redneck, not a pansy, shotgunner, sharpshooter, not fruit or fairy. Trevor the meateater but not veal. Never veal. Fuck that, never again after his daddy told him the story when he was seven, at the table, veal roasted with rosemary. How they were made. How the difference between veal & beef is the children. The veal are the children of cows, are calves. They are locked in boxes the size of themselves. A body-box, like a coffin, but alive, like a home. The children, the veal, they stand very still because tenderness depends on how little the world touches you. To stay tender, the weight of your life cannot lean on your bones. We love eatin whats soft, his father said, looking dead into Trevors eyes. Trevor who would never eat a child. Trevor the child with the scar on his neck like a comma. A comma you now // put your mouth to. That violet hook holding two complete thoughts, two complete bodies without subjects. Only verbs. When you say Trevor you mean the action, the pine-stuck thumb on the lighter, the sound of his boots on the Chevys red hood. The wet live thing dragged into the truckbed behind him. Your Trevor. Your brunette but blond-dusted-arms man pulling you into the truck. When you say Trevor you mean you are the hunted, a hurt he cant refuse because thats something, baby. Thats real. & you wanted to be real, to be swallowed by what drowns you only to surface, brimming at the mouth. Which is kissing. Which is nothing // if you forget. Trevor lying shirtless on the barn rafters. Trevor wearing the WWII Army helmet he bought for $7 in Wethersfield. Trevor on his back with his dead mothers radio to his ear, listening, listening. The field empty of an orchard. The night empty of fathers. Trevor so still you had to run a finger across his cheek, to make sure. & he twitches. & its fourth down for the Patriots, says the radio. With 27 seconds to go. & Trevors fists are tight as white rosebuds on the first day of June. All or nothing says the radio. His ear, every petal, pressed to the black world. We got this, he says. We got this. & hes looking up at the ceiling, then through it, to the starless sky & you never knew his voice could be this soft, as if he was whispering a secret to a seed still green in the loam. We got this, he says as dust coats your lungs, sweat in your eyes, Trevors gaze fixed on a star neither of you sees. We got this. & you believe him. // His tongue in your throat, Trevor speaks for you. He speaks & you flicker, a flashlight going out in his hands so he knocks you in the head to keep the bright on. He turns you this way & that to find his path through the dark woods. The dark words which have limits, like bodies. Like the calf waiting in his coffin-house. No windowjust a slot for oxygen. Pink nose pressed to the autumn night, inhaling. The bleached stench of cut grass, the tarred gravel road, coarse sweetness of leaves in a bonfire, the minutes, the distance, the earthly manure of his mother a field away. Clover. Sassafras. Douglas fir. Scottish Myrtle. The boy. The motor oil. The body, it fills as it fills up. But your thirst overflows what holds it. But your ruin, you thought it would nourish him. That he would feast on it & grow into a beast you could hide in. But every box will be opened in time, in language. The comma on his neck a border, a break. The line broken, a queering of syntax, of Trevor, who stared too long into your face, saying Where am I? Where am I? Because by then there was blood on your lips. By then the truck was totaled into a dusked oak, smoke in the wrinkled hood. Trevor, vodka-breathed & skull-thin, said Stay. Said Just stay some more as the sun slid deeper into the trees, as the windows reddened in the weak light, You should stay here, they reddened like someone trying to see through shut eyes. // Trevor who texted you after two months of silence writing please instead of plz. Trevor who was running from home. Who was getting the fuck out. Soaked Levis. Eye a burst plum from his daddys one-arm-lost-in-the-war haymaker. Who ran away to the park because where else when youre 15. Who you found in the rain, under the metal slide shaped like a hippopotamus. Whose icy boots you took off & covered, one-by-one, each dirt-cold toe, with your mouth. The way your mother used to do when you were small & shivering. Because he was shivering. Your Trevor. Your all-American beef but no veal. Your John Deere. Green vein in his jaw: stilled lightning you trace with your tongue. Because he tasted like the river & maybe you were one wing away from sinking. Because the calf waits in his cage so calmly to be veal. Because you remembered // & memory is a second chance. Trevors head tilted back, dipping into the dream again. Trevor with one good eye searching, searching. Ink-throat opened behind his incisors. Both of you lying beneath the slide: two commas with no words, at last, to keep you apart. You who crawled from the wreckage summer like sons leaving their mothers bodies. A calf in a box, waiting. A box tighter than a womb. The rain coming down, its hammers on the metal like an engine revving up. The night standing in violet air, a calf shuffling inside, hoofs soft as erasers, the bell on his neck ringing & ringing. The shadow of a man growing up to it. The man with his keys, the commas of doors. Your head on Trevors chest. The calf being lead by a string, how it stops to inhale, nose pulsing with dizzying sassafras sweetness. Trevor asleep beside you. Steady breaths. Rain. Warmth welling through his plaid shirt like steam issuing from the calfs flanks as you listen to the bell across the star-flooded field, the sound shining like a knife. The sound buried deep in Trevors chest & you listen. That ringing. You listen like an animal learning how to speak. *** Ocean Vuong holds a BA from Brooklyn College and will complete an MFA from NYU in 2016.

aS'The House 2 bill, passed on Wednesday, bans transgender people from using certain restrooms.

aS"Depression, anxiety, and other common mental health problems are nearly twice as common among LGB people as among the rest of the population. View this image  The research is a meta-analysis, or study of studies, published in the journal BMC Psychiatry and looking at large-scale population surveys in England, Scotland, and Wales. Of the 94,000 responses, 1.1% identified as lesbian/gay, 0.9% as bisexual, and 0.8% as other. A total of 16.8% of heterosexual people surveyed said they had symptoms of some sort of common mental disorder, such as depression or anxiety. But 26.2% of lesbian and gay people, 34% of bisexual people, and 23.8% of those who described themselves as other reported similar symptoms. Its something were aware of, Dr Joanna Semlyen of London Metropolitan University told BuzzFeed News. But the data has usually come from US studies. Dinesh Bhugra, a professor of mental health and diversity at Kings College London, agreed, saying that the figures do not come as a surprise. There is remarkable evidence from over the years. Studies around the world have shown rates are higher for mental disorders and suicide. View this image  The stress that results from being a member of a minority is one of the main reasons we see mental disorder in LGB people, said Semlyen. We know that social support is a protective factor in mental health. So is feeling included, feeling safe, not feeling rejected by your family. Gay people may be more isolated, more lonely, less likely to have family and social support, she says. Bhugra said that there is increasing evidence that the way were brought up affects our brain structures, and therefore our brain functioning. He says that the situation is probably getting better, as Britain (and the world) gets more gay-friendly. Thereve been some fascinating studies done in America that show that gay-friendly social policies lead to rates of mental health problems dropping, he said. One study looked at a state before changes in the law and afterwards, and there was a clear drop in mental health problems afterwards. It would appear that there is a causal effect. The implication is that as LGB people feel more welcome and included in society, they are less likely to suffer mental health problems. LGB people under 35 were nearly twice as likely as straight people to report having poor mental health, while LGB people over 55 were more than twice as likely. People in the middle, aged 35 to 54, were also at greater risk, but at much lower levels. View this image  In the younger cohort, it could be that people are navigating the process of coming out, coming to terms with a sense of being different, Semlyen said. Among older people, it could be that they grew up in a time when things were less supportive for LGB people when their sexuality was perhaps still illegal. She warned that this is just speculation but that it matches other things we know. Bhugra agreed with this assessment. He told BuzzFeed News: Im not surprised by the age profile. Young people who are struggling to come out might be very isolated, lonely, bullied at school. He added that there was another possible factor for older people: It may be related to not having a partner, social isolation, reaching retirement age and looking back and wishing you had had children, that sort of thing. View this image  All of the information comes from surveys with names like the British Cohort Study or the Health Survey for England. Those surveys, nowadays, include a sexual orientation question but not a gender identity question. That means it is very hard to get good demographic data on trans people. Semlyen said that she wants that to change. We want health surveys to include a question on gender identity, she said, to allow us to also analyse mental health among trans people. Theres no data at all on population health for trans people. That makes it harder to work out measures to improve health and wellbeing in the trans community. It also couldnt look at the interaction of race and sexual identity, because there werent enough LGB people who were black or minority ethnic to get a statistically significant sample. But race definitely does have an effect, said Bhugra. Wed also like [these surveys] to collect data on attraction and behaviour as well, said Semlyen. Not everyone identifies as a category or label. For instance, some men have sex with men, or are attracted to men, but dont consider themselves gay, she says. Theres also people who consider themselves queer or no label, there are all these other ways to be, she said. And remember, those labels are often pejorative; they carry quite a lot of stigma. That means, she said, that we could be missing part of the picture: Theres some evidence that same-sex attraction and same-sex behaviour is linked to mental health problems, but theres no UK data. Its for this reason that the study looked at people who ticked the other box. Thats a whole group of people who are actively not choosing LGB, but theyre also not choosing heterosexual, says Semlyen. And they are experiencing equivalent low wellbeing and mental disorder. Even the data the surveys do get is hard won. It wasnt long ago that even questions on sexual identity werent asked in demographic surveys. Every question in these surveys costs money, said Semlyen. Ethnicity, age, that sort of things a given, but this stuff is not. But these questions are very important to try to understand why people are experiencing what theyre experiencing.

aS" View this image  AP / Gerry Broome Republican leaders of the North Carolina General Assembly on Wednesday rushed through a bill to repeal all local LGBT nondiscrimination ordinances in the state and ban transgender people from certain restrooms. Introduced and passed within 10 hours, the bill then went to Gov. Pat McCrorys desk. He signed it around 10 p.m. Wednesday, citing North Carolina residents expectation of privacy and basic community norms. I signed bipartisan legislation to stop the breach of basic privacy and etiquette, ensure privacy in bathrooms and locker rooms. Republicans had unveiled the legislation Wednesday morning, arguing the measure was needed to protect women from transgender people and sex predators. They were reacting to an ordinance in Charlotte which had been scheduled to take effect April 1 that would protect LGBT people from discrimination in housing and public accommodations. The governor and other critics claimed the public accommodations portion of the city ordinance posed a safety threat by allowing transgender women, whom they called men, to prey on women and girls. The basic expectation of privacy in the most personal of settings, a restroom or locker room, for each gender was violated by government overreach and intrusion by the mayor and city council of Charlotte, McCrory said in a statement that explained why he signed the bill into law. The Charlotte ordinance, he continued, defies common sense and basic community norms by allowing, for example, a man to use a womans bathroom, shower or locker room. The House voted 8325 for the bill in the afternoon, and the Senate voted 320 Wednesday evening a unanimous vote only because every Democratic senator walked out. Senate Dems have started presser while session is still going on. They walked out of session. #ncga #ncpol McCrory said the bill was passed by a bipartisan majority, presumably referring to some votes from Democrats in the House. Despite the focus on Charlotte, the states pre-emption law does more than stymie that citys ordinance. House Bill 2 mandates that state law supersedes all local ordinances concerning wages, employment, and public accommodations. It also restricts single-sex public restrooms and locker rooms in publicly run facilities to people of the same sex on their birth certificate. In addition, it bans transgender students from school restrooms that correspond with their gender identity teeing up a potential legal clash with the federal government, which has found that civil rights laws ban transgender discrimination in schools. The American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal are exploring a legal challenge to the law. The advocacy groups warned in a statement that North Carolina could lose billions in federal funds for running afoul of Department of Education rules that ban transgender discrimination in public schools. Nine other jurisdictions in the state have LGBT ordinances similar to Charlottes. Democrats and some businesses, including Dow Chemical, decried the bill as discriminatory on Wednesday, as did the states attorney general, Roy Cooper, who is running for governor. youtube.com That North Carolina is making discrimination part of the law is shameful, said Cooper. It will not only cause real harm to families, but to our economy as well. Democratic lawmakers had not been given a chance to read the bill Wednesday morning, which was introduced just an hour before its first committee vote. Democratic Rep. Bobby Richardson told fellow members of the House Judiciary IV Committee, Im not really sure what is in this bill. In testimony before the committee, Christian conservatives said they were furious that Charlottes nondiscrimination ordinance would allow transgender women to use womens restrooms, thereby letting men prey on women and girls. John Rustin, president of the North Carolina Family Policy Council, told senators the Charlotte ordinance means men could enter women restrooms and locker rooms placing the privacy, safety, and dignity of women and the elderly at great risk. View this image  House Speaker Tim Moore AP / Gerry Broome The specter of men in womens bathrooms has been a common refrain among opponents of LGBT rights around the country. Echoing those talking points, leaders of the House and Senate called the special session on Monday. Lt. Governor Dan Forest and House Speaker Tim Moore, both Republicans, said in a statement they would address a radical Charlotte City Council ordinance allowing men to share public bathrooms and locker rooms with young girls and women. However, there are no known instances in 17 states and 225 cities with laws banning LGBT discrimination of the policies being used to promote or defend predatory behavior in bathrooms or locker rooms. Repeating a lie over and over does not make it true, said Reverend Mykal Slack, taking on the anti-transgender bathroom message. I am a transgender male, and I am not a threat to you, he continued. I go to work every day and go to church ever Sunday. But LGBT groups have been reticent to directly rebut the bathroom messages in Charlotte or before Wednesdays legislative session, instead focusing on the broad protections of the city law for LGBT people. That approach appears to re-create the same strategy that ultimately failed to prevent voters from repealing Houstons LGBT ordinance last fall. #HB2 debated in the NC House during special session. #KeepNCSafe #PatPromised In contrast, transgender women have a well documented history of being the targets of hate-motivated assault and homicide. Alex McNeill, a transgender man who lives in North Carolina, told reporters on a phone call Tuesday, A female friend of mine was punched in face exiting the women restroom by someone who thought she had been in the wrong bathroom. Trans women experience a greater risk of homicide than LGBT people as a whole, according to a June 2015 report by the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs. The report found hate-motivated violence against transgender people rose 13% in 2014 compared with the year before. The Charlotte ordinance would ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression in housing and places of public accommodation. Charlotte City Council Member John Autry supported the citys measure, telling BuzzFeed News in February that it protects vulnerable citizens from discrimination. But if the state tried to override the city, he said, We have no legal leg to contest it with. North Carolina law empowers the state with strong control over local jurisdictions, allowing it to preempt our authority, Autry said. If the state wanted to, they could come here to the government center, fire all of us, send us home, and run the city themselves. In 2015, Arkansas lawmakers passed a law preventing cities from passing laws that protect classes of people not already named in state law. The same year in North Carolina, Republicans tried to pass a similar law, but were thwarted by Democrats. Under President Barack Obama, federal agencies have interpreted Title IX of the Education Act of 1972 which bans discrimination in publicly funded schools on the basis of sex to also ban transgender discrimination as a form of sex discrimination. Two bills that would ban transgender students from using certain school restrooms died in South Dakota and Tennessee this month after concerns rose about federal litigation and loss of federal education funding, Until Wednesday, no state had passed a law banning transgender students from school restrooms that correspond with their gender identity. Alliance Defending Freedom, a religious legal group that opposes LGBT protections, praised the governor for signing the bill into law. A statement from the groups legal counsel, Kellie Fiedorek, said, The privacy rights and safety of North Carolina citizens shouldnt be cast aside or used as a political pawn for special interest groups that desire to impose their agenda to create a genderless society.

aS"Following NHS Englands decision not to roll out PrEP, local authorities said they couldnt pay for it either, as MPs, HIV charities, and Grindr weighed in. View this image  Facebook / THT Amid a growing row over the provision of Truvada the drug that prevents HIV infection the two largest organisations for local councils have condemned NHS England for refusing to make it widely available, for scrapping plans for a consultation, and for claiming it is the responsibility of local authorities. Both the Local Government Association (LGA) and London Councils have issued statements rounding on NHS England, which justified its decision on Monday by saying its not responsible for commissioning HIV prevention services as set out in the Local Authorities Regulations 2013. Truvada is the brand name for the only drug available that can be used to block the virus in a prevention regime referred to as PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis). It has been available in the USA since 2012 but is currently only available in the UK through private prescriptions. This is a missed opportunity to launch a groundbreaking prevention method that could halt the spread of HIV, said councillor Izzi Seccombe, the LGAs community wellbeing spokesperson. It is also not right that councils should be made to foot the bill. In stating that local authorities are responsible for commissioning HIV prevention, NHS England adopts what is, in our view, a wholly inadequate position. View this image  Justin Sullivan / Getty Images Seccombe said that during the restructuring of the NHS prompted by the Health and Social Care Act 2012, NHS England sought to retain commissioning of HIV therapeutics, which the PrEP treatment clearly falls into. The row, therefore, now hinges on whether the drug that prevents HIV comes under medication or treatment. For the LGA the answer is clear: It is, and should remain, an NHS responsibility unless it is fully funded for local authorities to pass on. NHS Englands statement is a selective and untenable reading of the Public Health Regulations 2013 and an attempt to create a new and unfunded burden on local authorities. London Councils echoed this, warning of serious consequences if NHS England does not rethink its decision to only offer the drug to 500 people in a few select test sites a fraction of what HIV charities and campaigners were hoping for to further study the treatment. View this image  iwantprepnow.co.uk We are deeply concerned by NHS Englands announcement not to fund, or even to proceed with a long-anticipated consultation over the future use of PrEP, said councillor Teresa ONeill, London Councils executive member for health. Prevention is the cornerstone of the NHS Five Year Forward View and so it is counterintuitive to drop plans for a new preventative treatment. ONeill said the decision by NHS England was a further blow as it reneged on an agreement it had with local authorities over funding. We have been working with NHS England (NHSE) for some time, she said, to try to find a way to offer Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to those most at risk in London, based on the understanding that they would pay for the drugs and local authorities would negotiate with providers through sexual health clinics to include PrEP in their delivery. London Councils said NHS England funds a series of similar preventative medication, such as the contraceptive pill, statins, and PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis), which is a short-term treatment that can block HIV following exposure to the virus. The criticisms from councils comes amid mounting pressure on NHS England to reverse its decision. In the Commons on Tuesday, Labours Catherine West MP asked Jane Ellison, minister for public health: Does she agree that yesterdays decision to abandon the rollout of a game-changing drug totally failed those who are at most risk of contracting HIV? View this image  iwantprepnow.co.uk Ellison replied that NHS England recognises that it [the decision] could have been made earlier but did not criticise the decision itself, instead adding: We must now work with both NHS England and Public Health England to understand how we can continue to learn from, for example, the test sites. The Conservative MP Mike Freer, however, told BuzzFeed News he was disappointed by NHS Englands decision. I will be meeting with the minister to discuss how the trials will be monitored and whether this would enable a fuller rollout later, he said, before adding in the Commons that he share[s] some of the concerns of Catherine West. Liberal Democrat Norman Lamb MP, a former health minister, also confirmed to BuzzFeed News that he would be lobbying against the decision, as Conservative London mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmith MP told a hustings on Monday night that he would use whatever influence he could to persuade the government to intervene. Following a raft of criticisms from HIV charities immediately after the NHS England announcement, the British HIV Association (BHIVA) joined the chorus of attacks. In a statement, the organisation said it was perplexed and deeply concerned about the decision, which, it said, raises many questions about how the test sites will be implemented and who will be eligible for the drug, and which could have devastating consequences with many more people infected with HIV. We will now urgently seek clarification of the process required to reach a commissioning decision, BHIVA said. If a decision cannot be reached by NHS England supported by a comprehensive array of stakeholders including local authorities, then we need to know who can make the decision and how it can be made. TV doctor and sexual health specialist Christian Jessen also lambasted the decision, highlighting the bureaucracy now encircling the issue. Shameful that 2000 men will still get #hiv every year because officials cant see beyond which department should be responsible for #PrEP, he tweeted. Shameful that 2000 men will still get #hiv every year because officials can't see beyond which department should be responsible for #PrEP ! Meanwhile, Greg Owen, a leading PrEP activist who is HIV-positive and runs PrEP information site IWantPrEPNow.co.uk, said he would stop taking his HIV medication in protest against the decision. Alarmed, however, by the number of other HIV-positive people who vowed to join him in stopping their HIV treatment, he announced today that he would resume his drug regime. Grindr Grindr Grindr, the US-based gay dating app, has also weighed in to the furore. Last night it sent a message to every user with a pop-up advert stating that the company is shocked at the statement from NHS England that the drug that prevents HIV will not be made widely available and linked to the petition set up to demand that that PrEP is given to everyone at risk of HIV. Thousands have so far signed the petition as campaigners and members of the public use the hashtag #WhereIsPrEP to rally support for it. NHS England did not respond to BuzzFeed News request for comment and refused requests for BuzzFeed News to interview its chief executive, Simon Stevens.   Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Following a letter from top drug advisers, the Home Office has confirmed that poppers wont be covered by the new legal highs bill. View this image  Mario Tama / Getty Images In a victory for LGBT and drug campaigners, poppers will now not be banned, the Home Office has confirmed prompting accusations of a U-turn. After the governments own drug advisers wrote a letter last week explaining that in their view poppers could not be deemed a psychoactive drug and thus would not come under the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016, a minister has responded stating that they had accepted and will be implementing this advice. Poppers the slang term for alkyl nitrates (the most commonly used of which is amyl nitrate) are taken recreationally to intensify sensation during sex and to relax muscles during intercourse. Following a debate in the House of Commons before the act was passed into law on 28 January, the government asked the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs to report on how poppers would be affected by the legislation. Todays letter from Home Office minister Karen Bradley MP to Professor Les Iverson, chair of the ACMD, says: I understand that the Council has now advanced itsunderstanding of the psychoactivity of the alkyl nitrites group under the Act andconcluded that only substances that directly stimulate or depress the centralnervous system are psychoactive under the Act. Clone Zone Clone Zone Bradley continues: Having given due consideration, the Government agrees with your advice and interpretation of the definition. We do so in the understanding that poppers have these unique indirect effects. She also confirmed that although poppers will be exempt from the legislation because of the particular way that the chemicals affect the body, all other substances that had been covered by the act will still be included. The minister added that the Home Offices acceptance of this advice from the ACMD will be conveyed to the police so that no one is arrested for the sale, purchase, or use of the substance. We will ask law enforcement agencies to be guided by our agreementwith your advice, she said. The act is due to come into force in April.  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Time to unlock the back door. View this image  Anal sex is often a thing people can be nervous about if they havent done it before. There are certain things you already know if youre something of a pro, but what about if youre completely new at all this butt stuff? BuzzFeed UK spoke to Dr Sen Cassidy, a doctor working in sexual health, and Tracey Cox, a sex expert, to help put together a guide so everything runs smoothly. View this image  If youre going to have anal sex with somebody else, it might be best to try exploring yourself first. You wouldnt buy a new car without giving it a test drive first, right? You can begin exploring using just your hands. Finger insertion is a great way to get your bottoms used to being penetrated, says Tracey. Sex toys should also be something you take into account. Tracey told BuzzFeed: If youre nervous about trying anal with a partner, try inserting a butt plug before masturbating to see what it feels like. There are a ton of sex shops online that you can buy anal-specific toys from to help you get used to the feeling of having something in your ass: A butt plug or a beginners dildo is a good start (just make sure whatever you buy has a flared base so it doesnt disappear and get lost in there). If youd rather not spend money on sex toys, Tracey says your hands will do the trick: If you dont want to invest in a toy, try inserting a well-lubed finger. Youll feel the sphincter muscles contract around your finger and have more of an idea what to expect when you insert a toy or penis. View this image  Its time to get scientific and look at the butt in more detail. An ass includes an external and internal sphincter. The external sphincter can be squeezed and released voluntarily while the internal sphincter works involuntarily and on reflex. If youve ever tried anal sex or explored your own ass (which you should totally do anyway if you want to have all the butt sex), you might notice that you naturally clench when something goes in. Tracey points out: The more you gently play around the area, the more it will relax. This is why foreplay and exploration is extremely important! But thats a separate point altogether. Its also worth pointing out that if youre doing anal sex with a man who is receiving, his prostate (aka P-spot or male G-spot) is located up his rear. Find that (up and back a bit) and hell thank you later. View this image  Lets be honest here, we all know what comes out of an ass, which is why a lot of people worry about the same thing: Will I shit myself? The short answer is no, so long as you follow a couple of guidelines. The basic principle is to be careful what you eat before you have someone knocking at your back door. Tucking into gas-inducing foods like onions, chickpeas, broccoli, or cauliflower is not going to add to the experience, says Tracey. A valid question is: Why should you have to monitor what you eat just so you can have anal sex? Well, you dont have to. By all means, go ahead and have a sloppy burger for lunch and a curry for dinner. Just make sure your sheets arent white Food is more of a judgment call on your end. If you feel comfortable, go full steam ahead and bend over. If you think you could lose half a stone as soon as look at a toilet seat, its probably best not to attempt putting anything up there for a while. View this image  If you know youre going to receive a dick in your butt, you need to make sure youre clean (unless youre into that shit). Sen points out that there should only be poo in the anal canal when you actually need to go to the toilet. Cleaning can be really easy: Simply empty your bowels first and then give the whole area a good wash with warm water, says Tracey. Wipes are also very handy to have nearby. If youre still not entirely confident that youre clean down there, douching is another option. For those who arent acquainted with a douche, its basically a ball that you fill with water and use to flush yourself out. Some people prefer to douche before anal sex to reduce the risk of a nasty surprise, says Sen. He recommends that if you do douche, use a bulb douche instead of a shower-head attachment as its difficult to control the water pressure, and only use clean plain water at room temperature. However, although douching is a thorough way of keeping yourself clean, it can come with some risks. The problem with douching is that it can irritate the lining of the rectum, says Sen. This can facilitate the transmission of STIs including HIV. View this image  Basically the most important element of successful anal sex is lube. Have you ever seen Brokeback Mountain, where Heath Ledger chucks it in without so much as a lick of spit and Jake Gyllenhaal is like lol this is fantastic? THAT WAS A FUCKING LIE. If that had happened in the real world, Jake would be sending Heath the bill for his new wheelchair. Even anal pros need some kind of lubrication, because unlike the vagina, the ass doesnt self-lubricate. So if you take away just one thing from this guide, make sure that its to ALWAYS USE LUBE. YOU CAN NEVER HAVE TOO MUCH. USE THE WHOLE DAMN BOTTLE IF YOU WANT TO. Tracey says that you should apply [the lube] liberally before you have anal intercourse (to the anus and penis). And never be afraid to stop doing the butt banging to add more. There are many different types of lube, some of which are harmful to latex and silicone. Make sure you use a water-based lube if youre using latex condoms, says Sen. Anything oil-based can cause latex condoms to break. View this image  This is v v v important to those who are beginners at anal sex. DONT GO IN DICK-FIRST. Things are tight and will naturally tense if you try prying it open like a fucking safe. This is why foreplay is important not to mention its a lot of fun, so why would you even want to skip it? As Sen says: The more time you take over foreplay, the easier it will be. Start with your hands. Tracey says that its important to have clean hands and trimmed nails and to remove all rings. You dont want to be fishing for gold if you leave your wedding ring on. Using lube, you should start by gently circling the opening with the pads of your fingers. When it gets to the point of insertion, you should start with one finger and only insert a little at a time. Remember, SLOW AND STEADY. Theres no use finger blasting a newbie because they will (hopefully) tell you to get out of both their anus and their house. You should wait for them to get used to the sensation and for the sphincter muscles to relax before going in a bit more. Youll find that once the person receiving is used to having something in their ass, they will start to relax. You should also think about multitasking if youre the one doing the anal exploring. If the receiving person is female, she might like it if you wash her front windows too. If the person receiving the finger is male, he might like an accompanying hand or blowjob. Rimming (using your tongue on the ass) is also a useful foreplay tool. Tracey says that you should keep your tongue soft and wet with gentle licks to begin with, before making your tongue stiff and pointed. View this image  Once youve done the foreplay and both of you are comfortable, its time for the penetration. Again, DONT FUCKING RUSH. This isnt the Olympic sprint and you dont need to have finished the job in 9.5 seconds. Take your time when entering and use the same technique as when you used your hands: Slowly push in a bit at a time, pausing to allow the receiver to get used to it before pushing in further. This might take some time and will depend on your partners penis size and shape, says Sen. Once youre in, Tracey says you should move very gently and very slowly. Move in and out but in super slow motion and only withdraw an inch or so. Also try circling your hips while keeping your pelvis close. One of the easier positions to try if its your first time is the receiver on top. If the person about to be penetrated is decidedly nervous, it makes sense to put them completely in control, says Tracey. Other positions you can try are missionary (requires a bit of flexibility) and doggy style. If you want a really gentle, non-threatening first time, try spooning, Tracey also recommends. Penetration is shallow and deep thrusting is difficult, making it perfect for beginners. Sen adds that positions where your knees are bent up to your chest generally feel more comfortable as this straightens out the anal canal. View this image  The most important thing about trying anal sex for the first time is communication. Communication is crucial, especially if its your first time, says Tracey. Whoever is on the receiving end needs to constantly give feedback about how its feeling. As the receiver, you need to be confident enough to tell the other person hey, that doesnt feel so good or Im not a pound piece, please calm down. As the giver, you need to be able to listen, take note, and change things accordingly to make sure the person on the end of your dick is comfortable at all times. View this image  Anal sex should never be a chore. Yes, more preparation and effort has to go into it sometimes, but it should be something that both parties enjoy. Just like vaginal sex, taking it up the bum wont always feel great. Sometimes it wont feel comfortable, and sometimes you might just not want to have a snake roaming around your back garden. And thats OK! But Sen says you should also bear in mind that the rectum contains thousands of nerve endings so basically it can actually feel great. The key thing is dont rush. Take your time to try different positions and work out what feels best for you, says Sen. With time and patience youll learn whats best for both of you. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The NHS has scrapped plans to make Truvada available, prompting fury from HIV organisations. View this image  Justin Sullivan / Getty Images HIV charities are shocked and angry over a shameful NHS statement released on Monday announcing that the drug that prevents HIV infection will not be made widely available on the NHS. NHS England published a decision on its website on Monday following an 18-month consideration period outlining its reasons for not funding Truvada in the majority of cases. The main reason cited was that NHS England is not responsible for commissioning HIV prevention services. (NHS England does, however, fund other sexual health prevention medication such as the oral contraceptive pill.) Truvada was approved for use in the USA in 2012, in a prevention regime referred to as PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis), which blocks HIV infection in those who take it, but has not been available on the NHS, except for those involved in a study. This study found that it was effective in almost all cases. The National Aids Trust (NAT) told BuzzFeed News: NAT shares the anger and distress felt by many thousands of people across the country at NHS Englands decision to abandon its work to provide PrEP, near the very end of the process. In a shocking U-turn, NHS England has pulled the plug on over 18 months of hard work which demonstrated the need, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of PrEP. View this image  NAT The Terence Higgins Trust, Britains biggest and longest-running HIV charity, said they were in shock and disbelief at the news. By denying full availability of PrEP we are failing those who are at risk of HIV. Todays decision by NHS England to depart with due process, and, instead, offer a tokenistic nod to what has the potential to revolutionise HIV prevention in the UK, is shameful. The NHS England statement outlined what it will provide instead: A fund of 2m over two years to supply the medication for just 500 gay men who are most at risk of infection a tiny proportion of what charities and campaigners were hoping for in order to dramatically reduce the number of HIV infections per year. View this image  NHS England / Twitter This 2m, said the NHS statement, will be used to set up a number of early implementer test sites. These will be undertaken in conjunction with Public Health England and will seek to answer the remaining questions around how PrEP could be commissioned in the most cost effective and integrated way to reduce HIV and sexually transmitted infections in those at highest risk. But the National Aids Trust attacked these measures as muddled and ineffective. The decision is not informed by any due process; the amount of money is arbitrary; the claim that more testing of PrEP is needed is disingenuous, said NAT. 500 does not remotely cover the number of gay men at high risk of HIV nor meet the needs of heterosexuals at risk. There is no clarity within the Department of Health, the NHS or Public Health England as to who long-term is responsible to commission and fund PrEP. View this image  THT The Terence Higgins Trust also called for clarity: PrEP has already been approved in the US, Kenya, Israel, Canada, France. And yet, our own government refuses to take responsibility for PrEP. Todays statement makes it no clearer who is responsible is it the Department of Health, local authorities, the NHS or Public Health England? We need answers, we need access, and we demand both. The NAT warned that NHS Englands decision will have serious consequences and appealed to senior politicians to intervene. Over 5,000 gay men will get HIV over the next two years very many of whom would not have done so if PrEP had been delivered as proposed Faced with one of the most exciting prevention options to emerge since the HIV epidemic began, and which offers the prospect of real success in combatting this virus, the NHS has failed miserably to deliver. The statement concluded: We call on Ministers to intervene and reverse this deplorable decision securing a process to provide PrEP on the basis of evidence and need. View this image  prepster.co.uk Dr Will Nutland, who runs prepster.info, a PrEP and Truvada information website, and who has campaigned for the NHS to offer the drug, also lambasted NHS bosses for this decision. The UK once had a reputation for being a leader in HIV prevention and that reputation now lays in tatters, Nutland told BuzzFeed News. The proposal to fund PrEP for another 500 men is a stalling tactic to cover up the arguments and confusion about how NHS services and prevention services should be commissioned. He continued: NHS England has turned its back on a process that could have significantly contributed to turning the tide of HIV in this country. The decision is ill-conceived, is not based on evidence, and will directly contribute to the on-going sexual ill health of the nation. NHS England on Monday declined BuzzFeed News request to interview its chief executive Simon Stevens about the decision.  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS" View this image  NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell AP / David Goldman The NFL and Georgias top sports teams suggest there could be economic repercussions for the state if Gov. Nathan Deal allows a religious freedom bill to become law. But the top lawmaker in the state legislature, which passed the bill last week, condemned inflammatory rhetoric about the bill and suggested overblown opposition is based on a misunderstanding. Gov. Deals office has said the governor will decide in April whether to veto the measure, which has been criticized as a vehicle for LGBT discrimination. If Deal fails to nix the bill, the NFL said, it would be a factor in deciding where to schedule the Super Bowl in 2019 or 2020. NFL policies emphasize tolerance and inclusiveness, and prohibit discrimination based on age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or any other improper standard, Brian McCarthy, an NFL spokesman, said in a statement to BuzzFeed News when asked about the bill. Whether the laws and regulations of a state and local community are consistent with these policies would be one of many factors NFL owners may use to evaluate potential Super Bowl host sites, McCarthy added. But House Speaker David Ralston, who backed the bill, implied critics didnt understand the legislation. The Speaker has been disappointed in some of the inflammatory rhetoric that has followed the passage of this bill, Kaleb McMichen, a spokesman for the Ralston told BuzzFeed News when asked about the the NFLs comments. He is concerned some may be reacting without reading the legislation itself. McMichen said the bill protects religious freedom without opening the door to discrimination. The bill wouldnt apply to businesses or commercial transactions, he said. [Speaker Ralston] would encourage interested parties to take the necessary time to read the bill and understand its impact before rushing to judgment. Critics have argued House Bill 757 is designed to allow people and certain religious organizations to deny services to LGBT people, motivated by a backlash to the Supreme Courts marriage equality ruling last year. It would protect certain religious groups including those funded by the government from being penalized if they decline to employ someone for religious reasons. It would also protect those organizations from government retaliation if they refuse charitable services on the basis of religion. Other parts of the bill would protect individuals exercising their faith. Although the bill passed by wide margins in the state house and senate, The Atlanta Journal Constitution reports that the Atlanta Braves, Atlanta Falcons, and Atlanta Hawks forming the citys trifecta of pro sports teams issued blunt criticisms of the bill as it sits on the governors desk. The Braves said the team believes that House Bill 757 is detrimental to our community and bad for Georgia. Our organization believes in an environment that is inclusive of all people. Falcons owner Arthur Blank said: I strongly believe a diverse, inclusive and welcoming Georgia is critical to our citizens and the millions of visitors coming to enjoy all that our great state has to offer. House Bill 757 undermines these principles and would have long-lasting negative impact on our state and the people of Georgia. Long considered hostile or ambivalent to LGBT rights, Fortune 500 companies and top sports franchises have increasingly become outspoken supporters. Explaining their opposition to discriminatory legislation across the country, the companies have argued LGBT-friendly laws are critical for businesses to remain competitive, saying they fear LGBT talent will avoid jurisdictions where discrimination is condoned by lawmakers. But that corporate advocacy has created a fissure among conservatives. Corporations have been traditional constituents of pro-business Republicans, and the lawmakers are torn between those lobbies and socially conservative activists who push bills designed to minimize LGBT rights. Still, sports brands have hardly been fundamentalists. When Houston voters repealed the citys nondiscrimination ordinance last fall, the NFL declined to withdraw the Super Bowl from the city, and the NCAA said it would still play scheduled games in the city. However, the NCAA also said said the citys vote could impact the NCAA returning to Houston for a future Final Four. The Human Rights Campaign, a national nonprofit that works closely with corporations on LGBT rights, announced the following groups also oppose the bill in Georgia: Apple, Dell, Dow Chemical Company, Georgia Chamber of Commerce, Hilton, Intel, Intercontinental Hotels, Live Nation Entertainment, Marriott, MailChimp, Metro Atlanta Chamber, Microsoft, Paypal, Salesforce, Square, Turner, Twitter, Unilever, Virgin, and Yelp. Gov. Deal who has been critical of the bill in the past and House Speaker David Ralston did not reply to a request to comment on the NFLs statements. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Exclusive: The World Psychiatric Association has condemned so-called conversion therapy and called on governments around the world to decriminalise homosexuality. View this image  Nicolas Chinardet The largest international organisation for psychiatrists is to publish a statement condemning conversion therapy as unscientific, unethical, ineffective, and harmful, BuzzFeed News can reveal. In a wide-ranging call to reduce the stigmatisation, discrimination, and resulting worsened mental health of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people, the World Psychiatric Association (WPA) will formally announce on Tuesday its opposition to any attempts to turn LGBT people heterosexual known as conversion therapy or reparative therapy. There is no sound scientific evidence that innate sexual orientation can be changed, says the WPAs position statement, which has been supplied to BuzzFeed News. View this image  WPA Furthermore, so-called treatments of homosexuality can create a setting in which prejudice and discrimination flourish, and they can be potentially harmful. The provision of any intervention purporting to treat something that is not a disorder is wholly unethical. View this image  Getty Although many psychiatric organisations in Western countries, such as the UK and the US, already publicly oppose conversion therapy, the WPA represents over 200,000 psychiatrists in over 118 countries, many of which criminalise homosexuality and, in some cases, condone attempts to cure it. The WPAs statement, which will likely be seen as controversial by many of its members, says: A same-sex sexual orientation per se does not imply objective psychological dysfunction or impairment in judgement, stability, or vocational capabilities. It continues: [The WPA] acknowledges the lack of scientific efficacy of treatments that attempt to change sexual orientation and highlights the harm and adverse effects of such therapies. The WPA also calls on governments around the world to scrap laws against homosexuality: WPA supports the need to de-criminalise same-sex sexual orientation and behaviour and transgender gender identity, and to recognise LGBT rights to include human, civil, and political rights. But to reduce the suffering and mental ill-health experienced by a disproportionate number of LGBT people, governments and psychiatrists alike need to go much further than decriminalising homosexuality and banishing conversion therapy, the statement says: [The WPA also] supports anti-bullying legislation; anti-discrimination student, employment, and housing laws; immigration equality; equal age of consent laws; and hate crime laws providing enhanced criminal penalties for prejudice-motivated violence against LGBT people. It also cites research demonstrating that countries that liberalise laws around homosexuality and provide equal legal treatment see a resulting improvement in the mental health of their LGBT citizens. View this image  WPA And in a radical move that goes much further than its British or American counterparts, the WPA says psychiatrists have a duty to fight discrimination against LGBT people. Psychiatrists have a social responsibility to advocate for a reduction in social inequalities for all individuals, including inequalities related to gender identity and sexual orientation, it says. The WPA will publish the statement in full on Tuesday and email it to the heads of all member organisations shortly after. View this image  Prof. Dinesh Bhugra Lynzy Billing / BuzzFeed In an interview with BuzzFeed News in 2015, Professor Dinesh Bhugra, president of the WPA, said: LGBT individuals are still seen as outsiders, not like us. If youve legally ended discrimination, great, but stigma hasnt gone away. He spoke of the need for radical solutions to combat the double jeopardy facing LGBT people suffering mental illness, adding that governments have to take responsibility for the mental health of the whole population. To say Im going to support the 90% or whatever who are heterosexual is against basic human respect and human rights.  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .

aS"The cherished aspects of my former country and gender continue to be part of my life. I live in the space of possibility between homes. Being trans is like running away from home. Alok Vaid-Menon I moved to the U.S. from the Philippines when I was 15, where I had been raised as a boy. About a decade later, I started to live as a woman and eventually transitioned. I think of migration and transition as two examples of the same process moving from one home, one reality, to another. But the two are also similar in a less obvious way. Like immigrants to the U.S., trans people whove moved from one gender to another are often expected to pick sides, to forget what we lost along the way just because were now in a happier place. There might be immigrants and trans people who are completely happy in their new homes, but I am not one of them. My relation to home, both in place and in gender, will always be conflicted and fraught. And being an immigrant helps me navigate my difficult feelings about gender as a trans person. View this image  Bishakh Som for BuzzFeed News My family immigrated to the U.S. specifically so that my siblings and I could have more opportunities, a better life. I took full advantage and ended up going to fancy schools, getting good jobs, achieving a degree of success I wouldnt have had if I stayed. When people ask me where home is, I might say New York out loud, but in my mind I still imagine the bamboo house and open rice fields of the Philippine province where I grew up. I legally relinquished my allegiance to the Philippines once and for all in 2012 when I gave up my passport, reciting a pledge that began: I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen. Somehow, even though it happened with less fanfare, I couldnt help but be reminded of the last time I went to a courthouse, to legally change my name and gender. Just like when I picked between the U.S. and the Philippines, I was also faced with two options, M or F, and I chose to move from one to the other. View this image  Bishakh Som for BuzzFeed News But the emotional truth is a lot more complex than these legal truths. The fact is that I will always be bound to the Philippines, loyal in heart if not on paper. Many immigrants have written about how we always keep a part of ourselves even when were somewhere else, but as a trans woman, its hard to talk openly about an experience I often have, of being reminded of my former life as a boy and young man. Even though I live my life as a woman, just as I live my life as American, my imagination still conjures up and talks to the memory of the Filipino boy I once was. When I find myself or others silenced or overlooked, Im tempted to keep quiet because I know thats whats expected of me. Thats when I consult the self of my past, who tells me: If you were still a boy, you would not allow yourself to be quiet. And so I find myself speaking. On days when I feel pressure to present myself in conventionally feminine ways simply to be noticed, that young Filipino boy tells me: You dont have to dress for anyone other than yourself. View this image  Bishakh Som for BuzzFeed News But to admit this to say that having walked in the world as a man gives me strengths I wouldnt have otherwise is to open myself up to accusations that I am not really a woman now, that I have not been through the same struggles women who were born in their genders have been through. This, too, is so similar to how immigrants to the U.S. are accused of not being really American, and of profiting from the labor of people who were born in this country. What these accusers refuse to understand is that whatever advantages I and other trans women have gained from our upbringing is more than offset by the challenges we face. But more than this, many of us use our experiences to champion the rights of women, precisely because we viscerally know the vast difference between how men and women are treated, in ways that those who have only lived as one gender cannot understand. Immigrants too have this same sense of comparison, a visceral gauge for valuing the different places we call home. View this image  Bishakh Som for BuzzFeed News Whenever I feel persecuted or misunderstood, I calm myself by thinking of the ocean, because its the best way I can describe the gulf in my immigrant and transgender identities. I often feel that my immigrant identity lives in that space in the Pacific Ocean between New York and Manila, where theres no land or other people so theres no possible way for me to live there. My gender often feels the same way, lost in the societal expectation that my behavior and presentation have to be tied to one of two options, the country of man or of woman. These days, Im more comfortable being American just as Im more comfortable being female. But to the extent that its possible, the cherished aspects of my former country and gender continue to be part of my life, and I live in that space of possibility between homes. Despite the hardships, being a person who has moved from one gender to another has been a great source of strength, the same way being someone who moved from one country to another has. Maleness for me is a land I have no intention of permanently forsaking, but rather one that Ive simply moved away from. Like the beloved contents of a suitcase, I remember and cherish the good parts of all my homes with fondness, and keep those parts with me wherever I go.

aS"None of which involve eating a doughnut off anything. Heres what they had to say about making it even more awesome, whether youre on the giving or receiving end. Because when it comes to giving head, everyone should be thoroughly enjoying themselves. Disclaimer: Theres probably no list of tips where every item will appeal to every person. So take what you like and leave the rest. Also, its important to talk about any new or different sex things with your partner before trying them. Consent is everything; please enjoy these tips responsibly! View this image  If Im giving head to a guy, then Ill sometimes ask him to sit on the edge of the bed while I do it. Its more comfortable for me, lets me deep-throat more, and he gets the aesthetic of me kneeling in front of him. It means that I can look up and he can have his hands in my hair, too.  emmal41 View this image  Talk to them! Ask them if they like what youre doing, ask them what they want. Have an open conversation and keep that conversation going throughout the sexual experience. But most importantly, dont do anything you arent comfortable with.

aS"Exclusive: In the first full interview with a serving British ambassador about being gay, Judith Gough describes what life is like in Ukraine for her, her partner, and their children and how she tackles homophobia while promoting LGBT rights. View this image  Lynzy Billing / BuzzFeed Everyone is tense and pretending not to be. Judith Gough, the British ambassador to Ukraine, appears from nowhere in a corridor at the Foreign Office, tall, striding, hand outstretched. She has the mannered air of a BBC newsreader breezy, graceful, with immaculate deportment which almost conceals the sense that she is paddling furiously beneath the surface. The Foreign Office press officer, meanwhile, is paddling furiously on the surface. This, it seems initially, is due to a sincere desire to ensure the interview unfolds without a hitch, but rapidly escalates on account of the fact that hitches start befalling us at every turn. The lift will not take us to the third floor where our designated room awaits. Or the next lift. Or the next. The staircase is blocked off. And the next one. The entire floor, unbeknown to anyone, has been closed. Then a door handle comes off in BuzzFeed News hand. The press officer looks mortified. He apologises. When we try to get a coffee from the internal caf, the queue is too long for us to wait. He apologises again. We walk and walk and cannot find a room anywhere. Finally, BuzzFeed News jokes that perhaps this is all down to a Russian plot to STOP GAYS TALKING. There is polite, awkward laughter. No one mentions the underlying reason for the tension: Never before has a British ambassador given an interview about being lesbian or gay. There is a small clutch of out British LGBT envoys, and one, David Quarrey the ambassador to Israel has mentioned being gay in an Israeli newspaper. But this is the first full discussion with a member of the press about life as an out-and-proud ambassador. It has taken 25 years for this to even be conceivable and it isnt until the end of the interview that the real reason for Goughs anxiousness emerges. Until 1991, the Foreign Office deemed homosexuality a character defect. You could not get a job there if you were gay and if you did and were found out, you would lose it. Official papers and memos that circulated during the 1980s and were unearthed by former ambassador Charles Crawford in 2010 reveal the prevailing attitudes among politicians, advisers, and staff. View this image  The courtyard of the Foreign Office. Lynzy Billing / BuzzFeed Crawford picked out some choice quotes from these internal documents for his expos. Homosexuality is described as manifesting in a variety of forms from inconspicuous stable relationships through promiscuity or exhibitionism to paederasty. One officer was given a chance to serve overseas after an isolated homosexual incident [but] has had to be withdrawn as his behaviour was giving rise to an unacceptable level of gossip. Gay staff would be open to compromise if they indulge in unlawful activities, or mix with unsavoury elements in louche bars, according to one of the documents, and should not be allowed in the service as homosexuals tended to promiscuity which involved mixing with undesirable elements with consequent security implications. Today, alas, there is no louche bar, just an echoing space at the bottom of a stairwell the final resting place for our endless search for an interview room. There is at least a three-piece suite. After just one question, however, the press officer falls through his chair. It is like a sudden collapse of a souffl. Or an empire. Gough, 43, is unable to control herself. She laughs and laughs, mortified for him and for her inability to close the pressure valve that has been loosened. Could anything else go wrong? the press officer asks as he attempts to free himself from the chair. Gough has regained composure. We pause for a moment, air cleared, and start again. Diplomats are famed, if nothing else, for gliding through social situations like silver service waiters. But what happens at a reception in Ukraine when Gough is introduced with her female partner? You get used to the double take, she says. But I get that for a couple of reasons. One is because often when Im introduced to people they think I am the ambassadors wife. So I get the double take. Ive had said to me, Oh, but youre young and female, you cant be the ambassador. And then if you introduce a female partner, yes, you get another double take. But on the whole in those situations people are polite. Gough says that in the countries in which she has served South Korea, Georgia, and now Ukraine she has not encountered problems from those hosting her but instead the reaction of other diplomats from other countries. Ive had some quite biting comments. BuzzFeed News asks her to specify. She pauses, eyes moving back and forth. Erm That might reveal who they are, but: Somebody like you shouldnt be posted in a country like this. Or: You shouldnt be doing the job youre doing. These comments relate to her being a lesbian? Lynzy Billing / BuzzFeed Lynzy Billing / BuzzFeed Yes, she says. There is a level of difficulty sometimes in dealing with other countries where they do not have the same approach to LGBT issues as we do. But then Ive also had comments that as an ambassador really you should be at home with your children, and not being a full-time ambassador. Gough has two children aged 3 and 11 with her civil partner, Julia Kleiousi, whom the Daily Mail once said was a tennis coach. Kleiousi is a civil engineer. Stereotypes are not only evident at ambassadorial receptions. But what does Gough say when other ambassadors fling judgements at her? A couple of things, she begins, One is: Im here because Im good at my job and I have the right expertise, and the second is: I represent the UK and we are a diverse country based on a certain set of values. I therefore reflect that country. She says it does not happen often but when it does, she retorts. There are ways of responding politely, saying, But of course Im the right person for the job my government thinks so. Goughs career began conventionally enough, as a consultant at Ernst and Young. In the mid-90s I believed that I was the only gay person working in the City and then, lo and behold, discovered that wasnt true at all, although she did not come out then as she was much younger and less confident. But by 2001, when considering joining the Foreign Office, Gough wasnt concerned about her sexual orientation being a barrier. I knew I wanted to be a diplomat and therefore why should I let my ambitions be thwarted? she says. Her voice has the clipped, quiet authority of someone who knows exactly how to wield power without alienating anyone. It wasnt only Goughs sexuality that might have thwarted her goals. More uppermost in my mind was the fact that I went to a state school and a university that was not Oxford or Cambridge, she says. The impression at that time was that the Foreign Office was only open to people of that educational background. Now it is much more diverse, she says, but after being accepted, there were other concerns: namely, whether as an openly gay woman she could be sent where she wanted. In the early days [after 1991] there was a perception that gay diplomats could go overseas, but much better if they went to Chicago or Amsterdam. But they didnt really appeal I like the grittier postings. View this image  Lynzy Billing / BuzzFeed And in the early days after she joined the service, Gough found there were very few role models there, in terms of fellow openly gay ambassadors. My sense was that yes, there were [other gay] people in the organisation, but they were not necessarily open about their sexuality. Gough, meanwhile, never felt the need to hide it. I think we have more role models now, she says. Do we need more? Yes, of course we do. She adds, as if to speak directly to any LGBT people considering joining: I can genuinely say that within the Foreign Office I have never experienced discrimination or harassment on the grounds of sexuality. Her tone is proud and upbeat, conveying a sense that this is a remarkable, impressive feature, rather than a department merely not breaking employment laws. It has taken 15 years in the Foreign Office for Gough to decide to speak about her life, sexuality, and career, and as with much of what is discussed, her reasons trickle out gradually. Ive always taken the view that I would rather be the British ambassador and oh, by the way, shes a lesbian, shes a mother, she has green eyes, and theres a whole set of characteristics that are about me, rather than being the lesbian ambassador, because I think that pigeonholes me. For any facet of identity to become unremarkable, however, requires more people who share it to be visible. Until then, Gough may well be seen as an intrepid LGBT pioneer, which wasnt strictly her intention. I have not gone out there and led the charge from the front, she says, because I think we are more effective if we are who we are and we introduce the aspects of our personality and character as we go through the role. Later, however, as she relaxes a little, we return to her motivation for speaking out now, and something deeper emerges. Lynzy Billing / BuzzFeed Lynzy Billing / BuzzFeed Its about being able to stand in front of your children and say, This is me, this is who I am, and for them to have the confidence in who they are and where they come from. I owe them that. I want them to be comfortable in their own skin. Will Gough convert her civil partnership into a marriage? When we get round to it, she says. When you live the lifestyle we live there are lots of things you want to do and get round to thats one of them. Gough grew up in Buckinghamshire, with one foot in the countryside, one foot on the underground line to the city. When BuzzFeed News asks if she was out at school she replies no, with a breathy snort that suggests it would have been unthinkable. 1970s Britain was a very different place, she says. When did Gough come out to herself? I have absolutely no idea, she says, laughing. Ive just always been me, if that makes sense? No, replies BuzzFeed News, to encourage her to explain. Was there not a time when she attached the word lesbian or gay to how she was feeling? Ive never been comfortable she begins, before changing tack. I dont know, I think theres always been a slightly rebellious streak in me that says, Labels are labels, Im me, and this is who I am. So, you know, yes, Im a lesbian ambassador in Ukraine, Im a mother, keen mountaineer, you name it, a whole set of circumstances and things. Ive reached a certain age where Im just me. After more than a decade in the diplomatic service, last year Gough accepted the ambassadorship in Kiev. Was taking a posting in Ukraine, a country beset by anti-gay sentiment and laws, a difficult decision? You weigh it up, she says. Can my partner work there? Will my children be happy there? Can I exist within that framework in a way that is comfortable for me and my family? She adds that the Foreign Office is pretty good at providing local information about a post beforehand, and the in-house LGBT staff association, FLAGG, is excellent at supporting officers. Lynzy Billing / BuzzFeed Lynzy Billing / BuzzFeed However, the situation in Ukraine for LGBT people remains hostile. There are no laws allowing any form of partnership between people of the same sex and no opportunity for gay couples to adopt. Pride marches have been banned or marred by violence and arrests. Surveys have shown negative attitudes towards LGBT people among the majority of the population. And in the last two years there have been neo-Nazi attacks on gay venues using firecrackers and smoke grenades. Some activists have said the situation is worsening. But is it? For LGBT people in Ukraine it is not easy, she says. If you look at the level of violence against gay people, there are frequent incidents. And there are very few clear Ukrainian role models. Whether the level of violence has increased or whether the reporting of violence has increased is not clear. She starts to talk about some of the LGBT activists on the ground. She speaks of their courage, the huge personal risk they take, and mentions the most well-known campaigner, Bogdan Globa, whose address to the Ukrainian parliament in 2013 about LGBT rights and the need for anti-discrimination laws was the first of its kind. Globa appealed to the somewhat startled besuited politicians on political and pragmatic grounds, but also through a personal plea. He described what life was like for him as a gay teenager in Ukraine. I was bullied and abused in school, he said. I was beaten and chased by older guys. I got driven from my own family because my parents thought that I was ill. I found the strength and courage to go through it, and today I use every opportunity to openly and honestly talk about it. Bogdan Globa speaking in the Ukraine parliament. youtube.com Bogdan has done great things, says Gough. As a gay man, standing there and addressing parliament was fantastic. Last year Globa told BuzzFeed News at a meeting at the Elton John Aids Foundation that Russias annexation of Crimea has been partly responsible for an increase in anti-gay violence in Ukraine. He showed footage of thugs storming a gay club he believes they were put up to it by Putins government. He also played a video of what appeared to be a fake gay pride parade, with what he said were actors carrying rainbow flags and EU flags. It was a stunt, he said, choreographed by Russia to entwine gay rights with the EU in the minds of Ukrainians an attempt to trigger anti-EU sentiment through homophobia. But Gough will not be drawn on who is responsible. Its very hard to attribute homophobia to any particular force or individual, she says. I think what you can say is that there have been those who have politicised LGBT issues as a reason for Ukraine not to have a closer relationship with Europe. YouTube YouTube Ukrainian police clash with LGBT people at a pride march. The British government, meanwhile, has promised to promote LGBT rights abroad. But what is being done to further such rights in Ukraine? We have conversations on a range of issues, and one has to be realistic, says Gough. When you are working in a country that is facing conflict and economic crisis and when you have 2.5 million displaced people the conversations tend to focus round those issues. [But] there is a subset of conversations and human rights runs through all of that. She continues: Diplomacy takes many forms. Some of the most effective diplomacy we do is the quieter diplomacy and the quiet support. There are conferences we support in Ukraine; there are activists we also support in Ukraine. There are also encouraging signs of change. Late last year the Ukrainian parliament outlawed employment discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation precisely what Bogdan Globa was urging. The debate, says Gough, prompted a huge discussion that had never taken place before in wider society. And among young people on social media, a much more mixed picture of attitudes appears, in both Ukraine and Russia. Gough mentions a recent Russian-language hashtag #GaysAreNotPeople that she says was largely hijacked by people mocking such a suggestion. YouTube YouTube Tear gas, Ukrainian police, and LGBT marchers with drums. Gough is active on Twitter, writes most of her own tweets, and, she says, is subjected to abuse from trolls. Some of them are quite aggressive, she says. Are they homophobic? No, she says, pausing. I rather suspect this interview might lead to a raft of that. Judith Goughs life as an out-lesbian ambassador with a civil partner and two children, tweeting about human rights and championing LGBT activists, is not merely extraordinary but, of course, has only become possible within the last two decades. What, asks BuzzFeed News, would a teenage Judith have made of it all had she known what lay in store? I would have been astounded and thrilled, she says. I always wanted a job where I could actually make a difference being a diplomat is not all cocktails and gin parties; its hard work, you see all sides of life. She smiles and looks up. The other thing I would have been pleased with is having a family life. Our time is up and she leads us into the most extravagantly decorated core of the Foreign Office to take pictures. She shows BuzzFeed News a vast painting, the figures in which portray different countries in the Commonwealth. There is a man naked but for maple leaves: Canada. An Australian flag flutters overhead. And down in one corner, there is a black slave child carrying food on his head: Africa. Gough says there have been debates about whether to paint over this depiction to see a continent represented like this is astonishing but, she says, the conclusion was to leave it so no one can erase the past. Countries can change. As Gough poses for photos, with Britains ignoble history providing an ornate backdrop, her guard slips. She talks momentarily about her fears about what we are doing and what we have spoken about. Finally, the reason for her earlier underlying anxiety surfaces: Doing this interview, she says, carries a potential personal risk to her. We walk out into the courtyard towards the exit chatting informally about the people Gough has spoken about her partner and children, her fellow gay ambassadors, the LGBT people of Ukraine. As she mentions the activists again and turns to march back inside BuzzFeed News catches a determined, righteous look in her eyes, conjuring something she said earlier that hangs over everything she has said: They are everybodys sons and daughters.

aS"Pee-wee Hermans first movie in nearly three decades, now on Netflix, is his most subversive work yet. WARNING: Major spoilers for the plot of Pee-wees Big Holiday. View this image  Joe Manganiello and Pee-wee Herman in Pee-wees Big Holiday. Glen Wilson/Netflix Before the credits roll in Pee-wees Big Holiday, Pee-wee Herman and Joe Manganiello are riding off into the sunset together. The new Netflix movie, Pee-wees first in nearly three decades, takes the Paul Reubens character on a cross-country journey to reconnect with the hunky Magic Mike actor (Manganiello plays a fictionalized version of himself). Because if Pee-wees Big Adventure is actually a love story about Pee-wee and his bike, Big Holiday is a love story about Pee-wee and Joe. From the moment Pee-wee and Joe meet, the two form an instant bond. (In this universe, Joe shares Pee-wees youthful exuberance and isnt married to Sofia Vergara.) As Pee-wee treks his way to Joes birthday party in New York City, he dreams of their eventual reunion. At one point, he imagines them jousting, which is probably the closest Pee-wee has ever gotten to a sex dream. And when Pee-wee is held up in typical Pee-wee fashion, Joe spends his party sulking, fixated solely on the one person he wanted to be there. View this image  Joe puts Pee-wees motorcycle helmet on before the two ride off. Netflix Once the two are finally brought together again, Joe forgoes the festivities to take Pee-wee to the roof, where they sit together so closely in a treehouse that a kiss seems nearly inevitable even though it never happens. It would be easy, albeit woefully nave, to dismiss the relationship between Pee-wee and Joe as a bromance. The homoerotic subtext is too readily apparent to be accidental, not to mention that Pee-wee is the polar opposite of a bro. And categorizing Pee-wee and Joe as just friends would be, at best, a euphemistic solution to a relationship thats deliberately vague but undeniably queer. Because Pee-wee is almost entirely sexless, his age indeterminate but his interests decidedly childlike, he can never consummate anything. Instead, he and Joe share the kind of mutual crush that passes for grade-school intimacy. No, Pee-wee and Joe dont fuck, but they do exchange friendship bracelets. Pee-wee has always been something of a queer character, but speculation about his sexual identity is fraught. Still, the character has long trafficked in subtext, due in part to his raunchier origins. Reubens created Pee-wee out of his work with the Groundlings, an improv team with a decidedly more adult sensibility. Pee-wee has never come out, but his coded queerness is, at the very least, a winking nod at an older, more perceptive audience. View this image  Pee-wee rejects Dotties advances in Pee-wees Big Adventure. Warner Bros. When Pee-wee who got his own series in the late 80s, Pee-wees Playhouse made his movie debut in 1985 with Pee-wees Big Adventure, he flirted with romantic entanglements with the opposite sex, without really flirting at all. With Dottie (Elizabeth Daily), the lovelorn bike shop employee devoted to him, Pee-wee is a bratty kid, repulsed by the idea of any real affection between them. Theres a lot of things about me you dont know anything about, Dottie, he tells her. Things you wouldnt understand. Things you shouldnt understand. And while his dalliance with a waitress named Simone (Diane Salinger) is slightly more mature, or at least suggestive enough to arouse the suspicions of Simones boyfriend Andy (Jon Harris), Pee-wee doesnt actually offer Simone anything more than a kind ear and some words of encouragement. (In 1988s Big Top Pee-wee, Pee-wee is engaged to Penelope Ann Millers Winnie and falls for trapeze artist Gina Piccolapupula, played by Valeria Golino. But the less said about Big Top Pee-wee, the better.) More than 30 years later, in Pee-wees Big Holiday, Pee-wee has another girl making eyes at him, Emily (Katherine VanderLinden), and he shares a brief kiss with Alia Shawkats 60s exploitation-style outlaw, also named Pee-wee. But the real romance at the heart of Big Holiday is between Pee-wee and Joe, in all his six-packed glory. Their love isnt explicit, however, because while the world has moved forward, Pee-wee himself has not: At 63, Reubens imbues his character with the same wide-eyed innocence and preadolescent mannerisms he has always had. Pee-wee and Joe kissing would feel unnatural not because its two men, but because one of those men is Pee-wee. Even Joe, with his well-developed grown-up muscles, is basically a kid in Pee-wees world. View this image  Pee-wee slips a friendship bracelet on Joe in the treehouse. Netflix However open-ended it might seem, Pee-wees Big Holiday truly is a queer love story. The subtlety of Pee-wee and Joes romance is not repressive so much as subversive. The use of queer themes in whats largely a kids movie introduces young audiences to the idea of bucking societal trends in a playful but powerful way. Pee-wee, who narrowly avoids a shotgun wedding in Big Holiday, is a reminder that you dont have to meet heterocentric expectations: You can ride off on a motorcycle with your arms around Joe Manganiello. (Or, in the case of a 1987 episode of Pee-wees Playhouse, you can marry fruit salad.) Its the kind of queerness that older, straighter audience members could conceivably miss, because its not for them. Instead, it embraces the kids who are different, and the grown-up queer viewers who, from a young age, were drawn to Pee-wees persistent rejection of the norm. Big Holiday is the natural progression for a character who, consciously or otherwise, has long served as a point of identification for queer audiences. Its the closest Pee-wee will likely ever get to a gay happily ever after, and for all that the movie holds back, its remarkably satisfying. For anyone who ever felt welcomed by the Playhouse and for young people who cant yet articulate that need Big Holiday is more than just 90s nostalgia. Its the kind of love story that still desperately needs to be told. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .   Hey! This video may have privacy restrictions.

aS"A jury found there was a business interest in CSL Plasma turning away Lisa Scott. View this image  AP / Jose F. Moreno A federal jury in Minnesota has ruled against a transgender woman in a leading case over discrimination at a blood bank. Although the jurors agreed that CSL Plasma turned away Lisa Scott because she is transgender, they also believed the company had a legitimate business reason to do so. CSL Plasma is pleased with the courts favorable decision, Robert Mitchell, the director of marketing for CSL Plasmas U.S. operations, told BuzzFeed News on Friday. The jurys March 9 verdict does not set a legal precedent like a judges opinion would, but the decision raises questions about the viability of similar claims of discrimination at blood banks, including a lawsuit by another transgender woman against the same plasma company in Washington State. Blood banks turn away transgender people routinely around the country, attorneys and LGBT advocates told BuzzFeed News. John Klassen, a lawyer for Lisa Scott, who filed the case, explained, This is a hard case to win. Florida-based CSL Plasma had argued in court briefs that federal rules ban all transgender people from donating blood, and that transgender people a have higher rate of HIV than the general population. CSLs Mitchell explained by email on Friday, Our position is always to follow the guidance provided by regulators such as the Food and Drug Administration and other government agencies to ensure the safety of the plasma we collect. But Klassen contended that here is no such federal policy banning transgender people from donating blood. He stood by the lawsuits allegation that CSL Plasma violated a Minnesota state law that prohibits businesses open to the public from discriminating against transgender people. He said that the verdict form used by jurors should have asked whether the companys ban on transgender donors broke that state law not if there was a business interest. We are very disappointed, Klassen continued, adding that the judge chose the verdict forms questions and the case was before a very conservative jury. When the judge asked what social and civic groups jurors belonged to, I think 10 out of the 12 said they are active in their church, said Klassen. That is not going to be the most favorable jury pool for a claim like this. The case started in 2008, when Scott visited a CSL Plasma center in Minneapolis, according to records in U.S. District Court. When a nurse found out Scott was transgender, the nurse allegedly told Scott, You people cant give plasma We cant take plasma from your type. The nurse also allegedly said that Scott had taken part in risky behaviors. The Minnesota Human Rights Commission found the blood bank had violated the states human rights law. But lawyers for CSL Plasma appealed that decision, saying in court briefs the company was following guidance from the FDA that says men who have had sex with men anytime since 1977 cannot donate blood. CLS Plasma argued that ban also applied to all transgender people. But the FDA has not been clear whether the ban applied to all transgender people on its face, the ban did not address transgender people at all. After the FDA relaxed the ban applying to gay men in December, FDA officials said explicitly that trans people are not banned. Moreover, Scotts lawsuit argued the ban should not apply to her because she has never had sex with a man. At no point, either before or after her transition process, has [Scott] ever been a gay man or engaged in any sexual contact with a man, her lawsuit said. In court proceedings, CSL Plasma did not present evidence that shows that transgender people who have never had sex with a man have a high rate of HIV. And the company did not respond to questions from BuzzFeed News about whether there was a ban in its case in Washington State. In that case, Jasmine Kaiser another transgender woman who says she has never had sex with a man has an ongoing similar claim in state court against CSL Plasma. Klassen said the jurys verdict in Minnesota creates a dangerous and slippery slope for blood banks to turn away people, even if the law protects them from discrimination, based on assumptions instead of risky behaviors. He added there is still a window to appeal the verdict. View this embed  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The report is being used by lawmakers who say the government must block LGBT propaganda. View this image  Adek Berry / AFP / Getty Images Police in the Indonesian province of Central Java said Thursday that they had thwarted a marriage between man and man in a statement posted on an official Facebook page of the Police Public Relations Division. Conservative politicians and religious leaders immediately responded to the report as further evidence of the need for the government to crack down on propaganda from the LGBT movement, a measure the Communications Ministry recently announced it would write in response to an uproar over LGBT rights that began in January. But details of the police account including the fact that the couple is from a very remote part of Indonesia and appear to have been organizing their wedding with the blessing of their families suggest that the couple may been organizing their wedding without any concern that it might be controversial. Neither the couple nor residents of the small village of Wonosobo could be immediately reached by BuzzFeed News to confirm the report, but the police account suggests that this was not a same-sex wedding. Instead it appears to be the attempt of a trans woman known as Andini Budi Sutrisno to marry a man named Didik Suseno. Pictures of the pair that accompanied the police report show one of them wearing a suit and the other decked out in full bridal regalia. facebook.com If the police account is current, the couples appear to have been marrying with support of their family. The account said the brides family facilitated customary wedding rituals, including announcing the union during a recitation of the Koran and receiving the grooms wedding party at their house. The account suggests the couple ran into trouble when the grooms family requested legal documentation for the wedding from the district office of Indonesias Religious Affairs Department. The request was denied because Sutrisno is legally designated as male, and the local officials wrote to both families ordering that the wedding be called off. The police said they were called in by people in the village who objected when the families prepared to hold the ceremony anyway. Indonesian law is clear that marriage in Indonesia must be between a man and a woman, the police statement quoted Criminal Investigation Unit commander Harsono as saying. The law obviously forbids marriage between a man and man. The release also quotes the head of the local religious school, KH Ismail of the Al-Iman Tanjunganom Pesantren blasting the attempted union. God created only male and female, fixed as man and woman at birth not transgender [waria] nor transvestite [banci], Ismail reportedly said. News of the police intervention broke amidst an unprecedented outcry against LGBT rights in Indonesia, which has also lead to new hostility towards the countrys traditional third gender community, the waria, who were have historically been treated as separate from LGBT activists with international ties. There have also been periodic reports from throughout Southern Asia spanning many decades before the birth of an LGBT movement in the region of similar couples attempting to wed according to local customs. But anti-LGBT leaders held up the police account as evidence that LGBT advocacy had polluted Indonesian culture. It shows the propaganda of the LGBT community remans incessant, said Hidayat Nur Wahid, deputy speaker of Indonesias legislature, told a local news outlet. So it has made victims of two [people] in Wonosobo.     Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"But lets shut it down anyway. Facebook: video.php Christensen has been campaigning against the program for weeks, calling on prime minister Malcolm Turnbull to cut its funding, but in an interview with BuzzFeed News he admitted he had only read some of the programs eight lesson plans. I havent read every single one of them, but I have read some of them. And the ones that I have read are a bit disturbing, he said. I have to question what its got to do with bullying. View this image  Safe Schools The genesis of it was about breaking so-called heteronormativity, to put in gender confusion amongst students, he said. Stuff in the resource guide says you shouldnt say boys and girls or ladies and gentlemen. Thats not just political correctness, thats trying to do away with gender. Gender is a reality. I think there should be an anti-bullying strategy right across the board, including children that identify as gay or lesbian or any one that sort of spectrum where theyre questioning their sexuality or have gender identity issues. [I have] absolutely no problem with that, he said. But lets look at all kids and lets look at it from the point of view of stamping out bullying and resilience rather than some other agenda. I do think that safe schools comes from some other agenda. View this image  AAP Some coalition MPs have labeled the review a fraud because it did not investigate websites linked to the program and the reviewers only spoke to five of the participating schools. Christensen is now circulating a petition among his backbench colleagues, calling on Malcolm Turnbull to cancel the programs funding until a parliamentary review can be conducted. But Christensen has admitted that despite calling for the review himself, no amount of change could justify the programs continued existence. I dont think it can continue. The program is fundamentally flawed, he said.

aS" View this image  AP / David Goldman Progressive advocacy groups on Thursday pleaded with Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal to veto a bill passed the previous night that they contend would allow LGBT discrimination. The groups may find a friendly audience with him Deal had denounced a previous version of the legislation and appears to remain critical. The governor has been clear as to his position on this issue and will assess the legislation in April during bill review, Jen Talaber, a spokeswoman for Deal, told BuzzFeed News on Thursday when asked about the final bill. On Wednesday night, both chambers of the Georgia General Assembly passed House Bill 757 to protect people and faith-based organizations that act on their religious beliefs one of dozens of measures filed in legislatures across the country as a backlash to the Supreme Courts 2015 decision for marriage equality. Most pointedly, the bill would ban the state from penalizing faith-based organizations that act in the name of religion to turn away people seeking charitable services or employment. It passed 104-65 in the House and 37-18 in the Senate. The final bill was a settlement between the House and Senate, which had approved a broader version of the bill in February. Critics worried it could let businesses discriminate in commercial transactions. This bill is a compromise that is the result of extensive discussions between the legislative and executive branches as well as the business community and many other interested parties, Kaleb McMichen, a spokesman for House Speaker David Ralston, told BuzzFeed News. The compromise bill, he added, would protect religious liberties without even the appearance of inviting discrimination. It is limited to clergy, churches, faith-based organizations and individuals. It does not impact businesses or any commercial transactions. Now its fate is up to Deal. The governor had opposed the more broadly written version of the bill earlier this month because it could be seen as allowing or encouraging discrimination, he said in a statement. But Deals office did not state directly on Thursday whether he would veto the bill in its current form or let it become law. Advocacy groups, working in tandem with business coalitions, argue that he must reject the measure. Carving out a small niche to discriminate is still wrong, Brandon Hanick, a spokesman for the progressive group Better Georgia, told BuzzFeed News. A little bit of hate is still hate. Democratic state lawmakers had universally opposed the bill. Rep. Karla Drenner, a lesbian, said in a floor speech, This bill says that I am not as much of a citizen as my neighbor. View this image  House Speaker David Ralston AP / David Goldman She argued the bill was a license to discriminate that would allow religious service providers to refuse LGBT youth or a religious school to turn away LGBT students. House Bill 757 has taken a particularly convoluted path. It began in the House in February as a so-called Pastor Protection Act, which would essentially re-affirm the rights of clergy and religious organizations to refuse services to same-sex couples that clash with their faith. The Constitution and other laws are regarded to already guarantee those rights. The House passed the bill in that form. But the Senate amended the bill later that month, approving new language that would also ban government from penalizing an individual or faith-based organization for acting in accordance with their religious opposition to same-sex marriage. That version defined faith-based organizations as any entity with governing documents that acknowledge a religious belief a definition loose enough that LGBT advocates worried it could apply to businesses open to the public. LGBT advocates, including Freedom for All Americans, howled that the expanded bill was a carte blanche for discrimination, and activists and businesses pressed Speaker Ralston to reject the Senate proposal. Which led to the brokered new bill. In the legislation approved Wednesday, the bill drops mention of opposition to same-sex marriage and instead frames its scope around protecting religious freedom in general. The version that passed Wednesday also limits the scope of faith-based organizations to exclude businesses. It would protect the organizations including those funded by the government from penalties if they decline to employ someone on the basis of religion. It would also protect those organizations from government retaliation if they refuse charitable services for religious reasons. Other portions of the bill echo the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, known as a RFRA. The bill says the government may not substantially burden a persons right to exercise of religion unless the government has a compelling reason and uses the least restrictive means possible. In its original form, this bill was respectful to all of us, Drenner said about the original Pastor Protection Act. This bill replaces it with a license to discriminate.

aS"The ambassador of the U.S. and his husband [were] in a school promoting gay relationships, people protested on social media. Facebook: EmbajadaUSASantoDomingo Conservative Christian groups in the Dominican Republic have renewed their efforts to oust U.S. Ambassador James Wally Brewster following his visit to a school accompanied by his husband, Bob Satawake. Mr. Brewster approaches our children in public and private schools, in sports tournaments, and other youth activities presenting Mr. Bob Satawake as his husband, the Catholic bishops conference for the Dominican Republic wrote in a statement issued on Tuesday. They are trying to confuse our youth and children by presenting a distorted model of the family, and in that way disparaging the authority of our laws defining marriage as between a man and a woman. Brewster, the former LGBT co-chair of the Democratic National Committee, was one of a several out gay ambassadors named by President Barack Obama in 2013. Most of these have caused little controversy in the countries to which they are posted, but Brewster has encountered stiff resistance from religious leaders from the minute he was nominated. The countrys cardinal called him a faggot (maricn) in a press conference denouncing his appointment that June, and the cardinal has continued to use rhetoric toward Brewster so offensive that Senator Dick Durbin wrote to Pope Francis in protest in December 2015. The new outcry began after pictures appeared on social media earlier this month of Brewster and Satawake visiting with a group of school children accompanied by accusations that they were there to promote homosexuality. ESTO ES UN ABUSO!Por qu a las escuelas? Por qu se permite? Sea ud lo que decida ser pero NO influenciar ni@s? THIS IS AN ABUSE! Why the schools? Why is this allowed? Be whatever you decide but DONT influence our children. In an appearance on a Dominican radio program a few days after the outcry began, Brewster said that the photo making the rounds was not from a recent school visit, but from an older visit he and Satawake had made to a low-income school. His most recent school visit was to participate in a United Nations week during which students discuss international affairs, he said, and he was there to speak about U.S. diplomacy. youtube.com In response to a question about whether they had set a bad example for the school children, Brewster said, Were promoting equality around the world [and] our objective worldwide is to promote LGBT rights. Thats not why we went to the school, but were not going to have people continue to condemn and try to keep Bob and I or anyone else in the closet. because thats not who we are and were proud of who we are, and were proud of representing the values of making sure that people arent marginalized. Brewster has made promoting LGBT rights part of his work in the country, including help establish an LGBT Chamber of Commerce with support from the U.S. Agency for International Development and meeting with local LGBT advocates as U.S. ambassadors in many countries have done. Along with the bishops protests, the countrys largest evangelical organization, the Dominican Council of Evangelical Unity, launched a petition on the White Houses website calling for Brewsters removal that collected more than 30,000 signatures in one week. The White House responded to Brewsters critics by issuing a statement to Dominican and U.S. media in which National Security Advisor Susan Rice said Brewster has the full support of this President, this White House and the entire U.S. government. Bigotry in any form is against the universal values that we promote and does not support the social inclusion that we believe is important for a free society to succeed, she said. We will continue to support Ambassador Brewster as he advances universal human rights. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Top drug experts have told the Home Office that poppers arent psychoactive and so wouldnt be covered by the new legal high law. View this image  Mario Tama / Getty Images Government drug experts have advised that the new legislation banning so-called legal highs does not cover poppers, as the chemicals in them dont affect the brain in a direct way. In guidance that appears to call into question the validity of the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) said poppers do not fall under the definitions of psychoactive as laid out in the legislation due to come into force in April. The new advice follows a controversial Commons debate in January that specifically discussed whether poppers should be included in the legislation. MPs believed when voting for the bill that it would cover the liquids the chemical name for which are alkyl nitrates. (Amyl nitrate is the most commonly used in poppers.) The government subsequently tasked the ACMD in February with examining how poppers would by affected by the new legislation. Its conclusion is clear: Alkyl nitrites (poppers) do not fall within the scope of the current definition of a psychoactive substance in the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016. View this image  leedsdrugclinic.com Therefore, the ACMD said, calls for poppers to be specifically removed from the legislation are unnecessary: Consequently, the ACMD does not see a need for an exemption under the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016. In a letter to Home Office minister Karen Bradley MP, the ACMD explained: The definition of a psychoactive substance in the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016 is not explicit with respect to direct or indirect effects on the central nervous system. Professor Les Iversen, the chair of the council, wrote that the definition of psychoactive as stated in the bill as stimulating or depressing the persons central nervous system is unclear. He added that in the view of the ACMD, a psychoactive substance has a direct action on the brain. Poppers, he ruled, do not, and therefore substances having peripheral effects, such as those caused by alkyl nitrites, do not directly stimulateor depress the central nervous system. ACMD ACMD In the letter, he explained that the ACMDs view is that poppers appear to induce a high in those taking it, but as this is not caused by changes in the brain but in related areas, poppers are not strictly psychoactive. The brain perceives a transient rush or high as an indirect effect caused by increased blood flow caused by the dilation of blood vessels in brain and periphery, he said. The effects of poppers on blood vessels in the brain should be considered to be peripheral as these lie outside the blood-brain barrier. In a statement to BuzzFeed News, the Home Office said: We have noted the advice of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs and we intend to respond shortly. The slated ban on poppers which has a variety of uses recreationally, including heightening sensation during sex, increasing arousal, and relaxing muscles during intercourse has sparked widespread criticism, and prompted Conservative MP Crispin Blunt to reveal that he uses the substance. I out myself as a poppers user, he said during the Commons debate, And would be directly affected by this legislation and I am astonished to find it is proposing to be banned so would very many other gay men.

aS"Noah Galvin is a young gay actor proudly playing a gay teenager on ABCs The Real ONeals. But he also understands why Hollywoods old guard finds his openness surprising. View this image  Galvin at the Television Critics Association winter press tour in January 2015. Image Group La / ABC When Noah Galvin casually referred to himself as a gay man in front of 200 TV journalists in January, he thought nothing of it. The 21-year-old actor spoke at the Television Critics Association winter press tour, on how his friends reacted to his being cast as gay teen lead Kenny ONeal on ABCs The Real ONeals his first small-screen gig and mentioned his own sexual orientation almost in passing. I have found that there is a very clear distinction between how young people view the show as opposed to older people who have gone through this, he said at the time about the family comedy. Im gay myself, and I havent gone through a lot of the things that Kenny goes through in the series. I felt a little disconnected from it because I was experiencing these things again but I was like, Is this crazy new and groundbreaking? Noah Galvin didnt think much of saying those three words Im gay myself two months ago. Ive been out since I was 14 years old, he recently told BuzzFeed News over coffee at a sunny cafe in Studio City, California. But when he left the press conference that day, Galvin was quickly reminded that, for many people, the idea of an openly gay actor playing a proudly out teenager on a network TV show is still something noteworthy. I came off the stage and Twitter was ablaze with Noah Galvin comes out at TCAs stories, he recalled with a laugh. I was like, I didnt come out to anybody. It was just new information to you. View this image  The cast of The Real ONeals: Bebe Wood, Matt Shively, Galvin,  Jay R. Ferguson, and Martha Plimpton. ABC Galvin is part of a generation that grew up with a previously unimaginable amount of LGBT representation in the mainstream media, from Degrassi and Glee to Ellen DeGeneres and Neil Patrick Harris. The importance of LGBT visibility has been a predominant motivation in many coming-out stories in the last 20 years, the logic being that kids are more likely or willing to embrace their own sexuality if they grow up seeing a larger number of LGBT performers and characters in the spotlight. So Galvin completely understands why his nonchalant approach to referencing his sexuality in such a public forum elicited a strong reaction, most notably from the older sect. They are the generation that went through the bullshit in order for this show to be possible, he said. He notes, however, that not everyone in Hollywood shares his outlook on embracing ones authentic self. There is a certain level of closeted-ness among the male acting community here I experienced that doesnt exist in New York, he said with palpable incredulity in his voice. View this image  Galvin ABC Galvin who was raised in an artistic community in upstate New York moved to New York City when he was 15 to audition for theater roles following a stint in a national tour of Les Misrables. Two years after the move, he began flying back and forth to Los Angeles to try out for television shows, with little success. Then, in 2015, he landed the role of Kenny, the son of uber-Catholic Eileen (Martha Plimpton) and Pat (Jay R. Ferguson) who comes out to his family in the pilot episode. Kennys landmark moment is overshadowed, at first, by a trio of additional revelations: His introverted sister Shannon (Bebe Wood) has been stealing the money she raised for charity, his jock brother Jimmy (Matt Shively) is anorexic, and his parents are getting a divorce. This group confession notwithstanding, Galvin stressed that he and his character had very different coming-out experiences: Mine was in a very liberal family and his was not. The connection between the shows religious and sexuality-focused themes is one of Galvins biggest sources of pride when it comes to talking about The Real ONeals. Hes gay and Catholic and has a relationship with God, and its the others around him who need to accept it and get used to it, he said. Its a cool thing to show kids that they can be religious and they can have a relationship with God regardless of their sexuality. View this image  Garrett Clayton and Noah Galvin in a fantasy dance sequence on The Real ONeals. Carol Kaelson / ABC The first three episodes of the series which is loosely based on author and show executive producer Dan Savages childhood not only tackled Kennys coming-out and his religious mothers struggles with her son owning his sexuality, but most recently told the story of Kennys first date with a guy, Ricky (Garrett Clayton). In The Real Lent, which aired March 8, the date doesnt go quite as hoped; however, the episode did feature a fantasy dance sequence between the two men that Galvin felt was significant. One of our showrunners showed her daughter the episode and after she watched it, she stared at it for a little while and then asked to watch it again, because she had never seen two boys dance together, he said, a smile exploding on his face. I love that [people] can watch this on TV and its going to be completely the norm. Its not going to be something thats an oddity. Its going to be a complete nonissue, and thats a really cool thing. View this image  Galvin and Plimpton. Vivian Zink / ABC Upcoming episodes chronicle some more firsts for Kenny his first kiss, the first time he asks a boy to prom. Its personally important to Galvin that the show continues to honor the romantic elements that are part of every teens coming-of-age, not just gay teenagers. There wasnt a lot of man-on-man or woman-on-woman affection on TV when I was growing up, and Im excited for kids to see that, said Galvin, citing Will & Grace and Modern Family as shows that have been criticized for failing to show realistic physical contact between the gay male characters. Kennys just like any kid going through adolescence, so I like the idea of him getting to ask a person out it just happens to be a boy and getting to have his first kiss it just happens to be with a boy. Its not lost on Galvin that he is now playing the kind of prominent gay character that the next generation of TV watchers may look to for comfort; that was why it was of particular urgency to him that a gay actor played the role of Kenny, so it wasnt an affectation. You cant replicate the gay experience or the coming-out experience to really understand that was so important to me, he said, his hand unconsciously rapping against the table to emphasize his thought. I have been given this amazing opportunity to tell the story of a young gay man coming out of the closet, and even cooler its not the story of a kid who is struggling with his sexuality. Im excited for people to see that. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .

aS"SB 180 would allow people to refuse creative services in certain situations on the basis of religion, and it could clip local LGBT nondiscrimination laws that prohibit those sorts of refusals. View this image  Republican Senator Albert Robinson, the bills sponsor. Via ket.org The Kentucky State Senate voted 22 to 16 on Tuesday to approve a bill that would protect people who refuse services in the name of religion in certain situations, and could partially override local laws designed to protect LGBT people from discrimination. However, lawmakers were unclear what the bills ultimate impacts would be. The senate also adopted an amendment that states the bill would not apply to those providing standard goods or services in the ordinary course of business or at a place of public accommodation, resort, or amusement. The bill advances next to the state house. Republican Senator Albert Robinson said the bill aims to protect individuals who want to refuse services to same-sex couples such as wedding cakes. This protects people in business who dont want to go beyond their conscience, he said on the senate floor. Robinson sponsored the bill, he told fellow lawmakers, because the homosexual community makes it an issue. Senate Bill180 is one of dozens bills filed in legislatures around the country to protect people of faith a Republican backlash to the Supreme Courts ruling last summer that legalized same-sex marriage in all 50 states. Democrats opposed the measure, including Sen. Reginald Thomas, who argued it would allow discrimination against LGBT people and possibly Jews. I hope this senate would not pass a bill that promotes hatred and bigotry. View this image  lrc.ky.gov SB 180 says that no ordinance or public agency shall restrict the rights of people who provide customized, artistic, expressive, creative, ministerial, or spiritual goods or services. Lawmakers questioned whether the bill particularly given the amendment limiting its scope would expand the rights of Kentuckians. But many LGBT advocates have been alarmed. Eunice Rho, advocacy and policy counsel for the ACLU, said the amendment approved Tuesday is a slight improvement on the current bill since it clarifies that not all public accommodations have a right to discriminate. Nonetheless, she added by email, it still would allow businesses open to the public to pick and choose whom they will serve without regard to local nondiscrimination ordinances or other laws prohibiting such discrimination. The bill essentially builds on the states 2013 Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which prevents the government from burdening a persons exercise of faith. Twenty other states have similar laws, with most being narrowly tailored to mirror a federal law of the same name, and most have unexplored legal impacts. Lawsuits have not established that they allow LGBT discrimination. However, SB 180 may go further than those religious freedom laws by spelling out specific individuals who are protected including those who create customized and expressive products and overriding parts of laws local laws. Speaking to preempting those local laws, the bill states, Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, no statute, regulation, ordinance, order, judgment, or other law or action by any court, commission, or other public agency shall impair, impede, infringe upon, or otherwise restrict the exercise of protected rights by any protected activity provider. LGBT advocates warn this bill will gut nondiscrimination laws in Covington, Danville, Frankfort, Lexington, Louisville, Midway, Morehead, and Vicco. As WCPO recently reported, The bill comes after the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Human Rights Commission ordered a Christian T-shirt company to get diversity training for refusing to print shirts for a gay pride festival. A state judge overturned the order, but an appeals court is reviewing the case. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Raffi Freedman-Gurspan is now the White Houses main point of contact for LGBT groups on all issues. View this image  White House President Barack Obama has appointed Raffi Freedman-Gurspan as the White Houses primary LGBT liaison, making her the first transgender person in the role, White House officials told BuzzFeed News on Monday. LGBT leaders applauded the announcement. Raffi is a great choice, said Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality. President Obama has said he wants his administration to look like America, and they have moved to include trans Americans. Raffis skills and personality make her the exact right person for this important job. Freedman-Gurspan became the first transgender staffer appointed to the White House in 2015, working as the outreach and recruitment director in the presidential personnel office. In her new role as the Outreach & Recruitment Director for Presidential Personnel and Associate Director for Public Engagement Freedman-Gurspan becomes the White Houses lead point of contact for LGBT groups on all issues. Marsha Scott, a straight woman, was the first White House gay and lesbian liaison, named to the role by President Clinton in 1995. Later, cisgender gays and lesbians held the role in the Clinton and Obama administrations. The position was held most recently by Aditi Hardikar, who left the post in January to join Secretary of State Hillary Clintons presidential campaign. Before joining the White House, Raffi was a policy adviser at the National Center for Transgender Equality and a legislative director in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. The Obama administration has been a steady advocate for transgender rights, including the use of existing civil rights laws to protect the rights of transgender workers and students from discrimination. We believe it is a tremendous decision by the White House to recognize Raffis leadership as well as the importance of having transgender leadership in an important role for the community, said JoDee Winterhof, the senior vice president of policy and political affairs for the Human Rights Campaign.

aS"I know who I am, and I dont need other people to know who I am to feel valid. With a new album and a new perspective, Ryan Cassata who came out as trans at 15 on live television has grown to embrace a manhood that isnt defined by societys rules. View this image  Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Its been seven years since Ryan Cassata came out as trans at 15 on The Larry King Show. And after being in the news last year when he called out American Idol for taking advantage of his trans status, hes grown to embrace his identity as a trans man who has chosen not to take hormones as part of his transition. BuzzFeed News caught up with Cassata on a New York rooftop a couple of weeks before his new album Shine comes out, which he considers his best yet. View this image  Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News For Cassata, the song that best expresses his thoughts about being trans is Were the Cool Kids, an upbeat dance anthem that squarely counters the idea that young trans people are freaks and outcasts. Its about not fitting into the lines of the gender binary, Cassata said. Were all gonna rise up together because were doing this new thing, and its cool, and its hip, and its about coming together and rising up, battling the ignorance and hopefully beating it. View this image  Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Its taken a long time for Cassata to fully come to terms with his gender identity, and especially his decision not to take testosterone as part of his transition. When I was 16 years old I wanted nothing more than to go on testosterone and to pass as male and to fit into that stereotype, he said. And luckily my parents were like, you cannot start hormones until youre 18. So I had two more years to think about it and I spent those two years thinking about it almost every day, like obsessing over it. And then I came to the decision that I dont need testosterone in order to be happy, and I dont need testosterone in order to be a man. View this image  Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Now, the singer feels comfortable not fitting into peoples gender expectations. According to Cassata: I identify as male but I feel like I dont fit into the gender binary. Sometimes I like to wear stereotypically feminine clothes, and sometimes I wear stereotypically masculine clothes. For most of it I fall in the middle and I dont really feel like I have to act male. I feel that I just need to be myself, and if my gender expression reads more female than male then thats okay. I know who I am, and I dont need other people to know who I am to feel valid. View this image  Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News His decision not to take hormones also has to do with his passion for singing. Because testosterone typically thickens the vocal cords and lowers the voices of trans men, Cassata wanted to make sure to preserve his sound. I worked really hard on my singing voice. I used to not be able to sing at all and I would just talk-sing, he said. And now I could sing, and I dont want to trade that for anything. Its something that I take pride in and its something that didnt come easy for me at all. I had to work on it a lot and I dont wanna risk it at all. View this image  Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Cassata hopes that his example would allow trans and cis people alike to feel comfortable just being themselves, and to find comfort in his music. I want my music to touch people, he said. I want to take people away from pain and I think that the good thing about music is that when you hear music it takes you away from whatever youre going through. You could totally get lost in music and I think thats why music is such a powerful tool and why I love music so much.

aS"Because sometimes three is so much better than two. View this image  Michelle Rial / BuzzFeed News Jim and John, New Yorkers in their mid-thirties, recently celebrated their 10-year anniversary. They met in 2005 an AOL chatroom Queens M4M and quickly hit it off. To celebrate a decade of commitment, the two exchanged rings last year. During the private exchange, Jim and John also gave a ring to their partner, Thomas, whom the couple began dating two years ago after meeting on Scruff, a popular app for gay men to connect. We didnt want him to feel left out, John explained. Decades ago, such a ceremony might have seemed unthinkable. However, the practice of polyamory among both queer and heterosexual populations has become more visible in recent years. In 1997, Dossie Easton and Catherine A. Liszt penned The Ethical Slut, a landmark manual for those trying to navigate non-monogamy. Seventeen years later, estimates from Psychology Today suggested that between 1.2 million and 2.4 million Americans are engaged in poly arrangements, meaning that they have more than one romantic or sexual partner at a time. But aside from books like The Ethical Slut or Franklin Veaux and Eve Rickerts More Than Two, the resources for people in relationships like John, Jim, and Thomass remain few and far between. BuzzFeed talked to poly folks about what makes their relationships work and what they would recommend for others willing to give triads a shot. View this image  Jim, John, and Thomas live in the Rockaways, the peninsula located at the southern tip of Queens. Jim and Johns two-story house looks more like somewhere my grandmother might call home dressed in decorative pillows and tchotchkes for the impending Christmas celebration. The trio have built a life together that can appropriately be described as wholesome. John, 33, is a librarian, while Jim, 39, is employed at a local Duane Reade, and they ride the train together to work each morning. In 2014, they met Thomas, 21, a Brooklyn native who is working as a cook while he gets his degree, and in the time since, theyve spent almost every day or every other day with him. Thomas lives in Bergen Beach but spends time in between his apartment and the home Jim and John share (which is an hour commute via public transit). John mentioned that negotiating that imbalance, where two partners live together and the other does not, has made it important to make Thomas feel welcome from day one. I never want him to feel like its two against one, John said. All three of them grew up in the city, enough to know that life, like the citys ever-shifting neighborhoods, changes. Restaurants come and go, your favorite independent caf becomes a high-rise, and friends move to other cities. But bringing Thomas into their relationship has provided unexpected stability, giving them an equilibrium that they otherwise lacked. Thomas really balances both of us, John said. Each of them fills a different role in the relationship: John is the most outgoing one, the person the group relies on when they need to call to order a pizza. Thomas is more inclined to go with the flow, someone comfortable with staying on the couch and doing nothing. Jim is the decider, the one most likely to be a definitive vote when opinion is split. View this image  If communication is an essential part of any healthy relationship, thats especially true in triads, when you have to navigate three different sets of desires, needs, and expectations. According to Anna, 32, poly folks are forced practice conflict resolution in a way that many couples do not. [Communication] is not something youre born with, she said. Its a skill like riding a bike. Theyre forced to develop it, because theyre forced to talk about all these problems that you wouldnt even think about in other relationship configurations. You dont take anything for granted. When I asked how John, Jim, and Thomas ensure honest and open communication among the three of them, they all were quick to respond at the exact same time: group texts! They also agreed that having a third person around to hash out issues can actually be a boon to communication. When youre in a one-on-one relationship, you always think youre right, John said. In a group, theres always someone to be the voice of reason. According to John, the issue in many dyads (two-person relationships) is that its me against them, them against me. You sometimes need the mediator, he continued. Traditional couples might end up in therapy because they dont have that other person coming in. But whether or not youre in a poly arrangement, Anna believes that communication is the number-one key to any relationship. She said, Ninety percent of questions in a relationship are answered by talking to your partner. If you cant talk about whats upsetting you or making you happy, its hard to connect in ways that make relationships work. View this image  For Billy, Danny, and Dominic, the biggest issue wasnt communication but scheduling, including negotiating their varying schedules. Billy, 21, met Dominic, 28, last summer, shortly before reconnecting with Danny, 23, an old love interest with whom he had lost contact. After scheduling a date with Danny, Billy called it off confessing that he and Dominic were in a relationship. Danny proposed a solution: What about polyamory? But the reality of that arrangement proved even more complicated in the early weeks of the relationship. At that time I was working two jobs and was really busy and lived 40 minutes from Dom, Billy said. Danny lived even further away. I would get jealous because they would get to spend most of a weekend together, whereas I might only get to see them for one evening. To ease the burden of their differing schedules, Danny, Dom, and Billy recently decided to move in together, signing the lease for a two-bedroom last December. That extra room ended up coming in handy, simply because fitting three people in the same bed can be surprisingly difficult. When we first moved in together we all shared one bed, Billy said. Dom is very broad because hes always in the gym, so after a while we spread out over two rooms. According to Billy, they try to trade off nights in the third bedroom to be equitable. Billy explained that making time together has remained a challenge for their relationship. We do have to plan things quite far in advance to make sure we can all get the time off, he said. According to Kari David, 28, the issue is that triads arent just a matter of coordinating three peoples calendars. You have to worry about three partners with potentially very different schedules. Theres more logistical concerns: It really is a balancing of four relationships, not just one, he said. All four need time (although not necessarily equal time) and care, and thats a lot to schedule and keep track of. When its going well, it can work really nicely, but its definitely a bigger commitment. If relationships in general can be time-consuming, poly arrangements have the potential to be even more so. Thats why Kari David, who identifies as nonbinary and uses male pronouns, strongly advocates the use of Google Calendar to keep track of appointments. Its necessary to be aware that you are going to want one-on-one time with each partner (and them with each other), in addition to the time all three of you spend together, he said. View this image  In addition to communication and scheduling, a common problem in poly relationships is negotiating jealousy. Triads can definitely amplify relationship problems, Kari David said. In one of his relationships the less successful one each of his partners would come to him to vent about the others perceived faults, instead of addressing the complaint directly. That might have eased tension in the short term, but it rarely solved anything. It was really hard for all of us to figure out how to have boundaries when we were all so intimate with each other, but not equally suited to one another or all equally involved in every conflict, he said. But in good triads, forcing each partner to be more mindful about how they interact with each other can strengthen the relationship. According to Kari David, the biggest lesson he has learned from engaging in polyamory is not to make assumptions and to negotiate things explicitly: Even if two people luck out and are on the same page, the third is likely to want something different, he said. Amanda, 34, agreed arguing that it all comes down to consent. As she explained, its important to [make] sure that you dont take your partners consent for granted. She continued, Understand that your relationship is a living thing, and that it will change, and have a degree of understanding and flexibility when confronted with that reality. View this image  Polyamory often involves a lot of trial and error trying things that dont work and being open to to the fact that you might be afraid of life outside monogamy. Sometimes we have reactions that are more societal than personal and its worth giving yourself a minute to parse through that, Amanda said. Some of my first encounters with polyamory involved cheating, and it took me a while to figure out that I hated lying much more than I hated my partner sleeping with someone else. As Amanda explained, it can be difficult to deal with the pervasive stigma around poly relationships. But whats so great about them is that you get to reflect on those societal pressures and define the terms of your relationships for yourself. How you love and whom you love is up to you. You learn that you can change the rules and do things in a way that feels good to you, even if its not the way you grew up being taught relationships work, Amanda said. While John explained that hes learned a lot more patience through dating Jim and Thomas, he felt that what has made their triad work is that its a democracy. Its majority rules what works best for the most amount of people, John said. This wouldnt work if we were all extremely stubborn. Because you know that, in the long run, you need to think about someone other than yourself. When youre dealing with three partners, John explained that its incredibly important to make sure everyone is equally heard and equally valued. But if poly relationships have their advantages and their unique challenges, being in a triad is just like any other relationship. Theyre pretty much the same, Billy said. We still cant decide where we want to eat out, or what movie to watch; were worried our mothers-in-law wont like us; and we get annoyed at each other for not tidying up after ourselves.

aS"The celebrated author, playwright, and HIV/AIDS activist Larry Kramer might be 80 but, he told BuzzFeed News, hes still just as angry. View this image  Andrew H. Walker / Getty Images It is four days after the death of Nancy Reagan when Larry Kramer picks up the phone to BuzzFeed News and, with his once thundering voice now more a quiver, delivers the following verdict on the former first lady: The woman was a horror story. She was an over-sexed woman who was famous for it in Hollywood and shes been made into some sort of saint, he says. She was not at all what she appeared to be. Her husband was awful in terms of AIDS and one can only assume she was very much part of that. In the hours after Reagans death on Sunday, reports re-emerged of her refusing to help her friend Rock Hudson, the gay Hollywood legend, when he was dying of AIDS. Kramer mentions the 1988 play he wrote about Nancy Reagan Just Say No: A Play About a Farce the name of which references her much-ridiculed anti-drugs campaign. Its a farce, he spits, as if to emphasise what is already in its title. It would be a courageous writer who ever attempted to depict Larry Kramers life in similar terms. There are two things people say when describing the 80-year-old, Oscar-nominated writer and totemic HIV/AIDS activist: He is furious and he has saved lives. Indeed, almost everyone who appears in the HBO documentary Larry Kramer: In Love and Anger riffs on these themes themes that will play out again in two special screenings of the film in London this weekend. They mention the fear he instilled (in just about everybody). They mention that he did not care what anyone thought. In the 1980s footage we hear his pickaxe words and firebomb speeches, fuming, vibrating, a primal scream fashioned into the purest rhetorical punches: AIDS is intentional genocide. PLAGUE. We are in the middle of a FUCKING PLAGUE. How long are you going to let your presidents get away with murder? HBO HBO Larry Kramer in the 1980s He made scientists shake. He forced politicians to listen. He founded the Gay Mens Health Crisis (GMHC), the largest private HIV/AIDS service in the world. And he started ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power), the direct action group that transformed the response to the disease, bulldozing the bureaucracy and apathy many felt had infected the government and pharmaceutical companies. Finally in 1996, after 15 years of AIDS and millions of deaths, the drugs came. Many credit Kramer with the fact that effective antiretroviral medication arrived at all. This year marks its 20th anniversary. But there is more to Larry Kramer than fury and fighting. His writing, which earned an Academy Award nomination for the screenplay to Women in Love, a Pulitzer Prize shortlisting for The Destiny of Me, and an Emmy for The Normal Heart, is infused with love and obsessed with the quest for it. Even the inflammatory Faggots, his bestselling 1978 novel, which could have been subtitled Gay Men Are Fucking Up by Constantly Fucking Each Other, was really about longing for a profound, lasting connection. Kramer, finally, found it. HBO HBO Mark Ruffalo and Julia Roberts in HBOs The Normal Heart. In the documentary after more than an hour of archive film showing Kramer raging at demos, at politicians, even at fellow activists we see him frail in hospital in 2013, recovering from a liver transplant. Barely able to speak, he marries his long-term partner, David Webster, an architect, from his bed. They first met in 1966 Webster inspired Faggots. Theyve been reunited since 1991. Afterwards, outside the hospital room, a friend called Louis Bonsignore says the following: Im alive today because of him. Larry Kramer is the one that spurred the government, spurred the [former New York mayor] Koch administration. He was the pain in the ass that everyone needed him to be. There are thousands and thousands and thousands of men, women, and especially children that are alive today because of Larry Kramer. But is he still a pain in the ass? It is mere moments into the conversation with BuzzFeed News when another question suggests an answer. The question was: Are you worried with this HBO documentary that you are in danger of being well liked? He laughs briefly. I dont think about things like that. I have things to say and I say them, and I dont care whether you like them or not. As the interview builds and his opinions spill out, they look less and less likely to raise his popularity. Just nine months after same-sex marriage was secured in the US, one of the great victories for the LGBT rights movement, Kramer says, The gay population is still not very good at fighting, at being united for our rights. He adds, We dont have any recognised leaders who speak for us and were facing an enormous backlash because of gay marriage. Why does he think there is this apparent failure of LGBT activism? Ive just published a book called The American People, which is my attempt to write the history of homosexuality in America from the very beginning, he says. And you realise how hated everyone gay was since the very beginning. You can understand how hard it is for gay people its almost as if that fear of being hated is genetically born into us because there are all these centuries of our hiding. And that is the closest Ive come to a reason as to why were not fighting any more. Amazon Amazon BuzzFeed News asks Kramer, whose parents were Jewish, whether he thinks there is more hatred towards gay people than Jewish people. In this country? Yes I do, he replies. But perhaps the most incendiary comments come when the discussion moves on to Truvada, the antiretroviral drug that prevents people becoming HIV-positive and that was approved by the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) in 2012. Kramer was widely criticised for comments in the New York Times in 2014 in which he opined: anybody who voluntarily takes an antiviral every day has got to have rocks in their heads. Theres something to me cowardly about taking Truvada instead of using a condom. Youre taking a drug that is poison to you. Last year, his stance seemed to soften. Has it? I never was against it, he begins. I never said dont take it, I just said its complicated this was at the beginning and Im still being hung for something that was several years ago when we knew very little. In what some might consider an exaggeration of what life is like on Truvada, he adds, I just said we dont have enough information and I wonder if people realise that taking it requires constant monitoring of your blood constant visits to the doctor to take the blood to see if its working and are only taking it to be able to return to the kind of life that got us into this turmoil in the first place. Such judgment will likely not be well received by many, but he emphasises, Im still worried about that. What, asks BuzzFeed News, is wrong with that kind of life? He pauses for a while. Well, the statistics are beginning to show that certain things are happening: People dont take Truvada regularly, or for instance, theres been an enormous rise in [other] sexually transmitted infections, hepatitis suddenly going through the roof Truvada doesnt take care of them and why are they suddenly going through the roof? Because were now back to the days where sex was like a candy store. There is no time for BuzzFeed News to point out that studies have not yet shown a correlation (or causation) of Truvada with increased STIs because Kramer is still holding forth: Theres responsibility involved in all of this, that people seem very much to overlook, the fact that infected people are capable of murdering other gay people by their behaviour. ACT UP ACT UP LONDON / Facebook Publicity material for the original ACT UP (left) and Londons unofficial offshoot What does he think about the fact that in the UK the National Health Service has still not made Truvada available to patients at risk of infection? Well our [the US] government isnt providing it either, he replies, before adding, Where are the protests and making demands such as ACT UP was doing here constantly? You dont get anything without being very in-your-face angry and in large numbers. Thats when theyre scared of you. I dont see much on the internet that says the [UK] gay population is angry and protesting. Has he heard of a new, British version of ACT UP? No. What do they do thats different from the old ACT UP? Partly they campaign for Truvada in the UK, says BuzzFeed News. Why isnt the old ACT UP doing that too? he asks. The British government has recently blocked attempts to make sex education compulsory in all schools. What does Kramer think about that? You will pay the price for that, he says, adding that the price is death in many instances. While he is still in full flow despite his partial deafness meaning questions sometimes have to be repeated several times we return to US politics. I would like Hillary Clinton to win because I think she is smarter at how power and government works than Bernie [Sanders] is, he says. But just as Kramer is about to explain his doorbells goes. He screams: COME IN, COME IN. HELLO. A voice male and, it seems, a neighbour replies, Larry, Ive got dessert for you and David. Kramers tone immediately sweetens, Oh bless you, thank you, before he picks up the receiver and the invective continues: Shes been through such shit since day one and she knows how to play that game and unfortunately power is a game. View this image  Larry Kramer and Mark Ruffalo at the 2015 premiere of HBOs Larry Kramer In Love And Anger Dave Kotinsky / Getty Images What will he do if Donald Trump wins? Move to Canada. Has Obama helped in the fight against HIV/AIDS? Yes and no, he replies. There hasnt been one single president since 1981 who has taken AIDS on as an issue to discuss publicly and that includes Obama. Congress right now is in the process of chopping away at the NIH [National Institutes of Health] budget for research so it would be nice if Obama said something about that publicly. But he hasnt. That said, Kramer adds, He certainly helped us with the marriage thing and has been a better president for us than any of his predecessors. Obama is also the first president to preside over an era in which survivors of the 1980s AIDS crisis grew old. A recent report by the San Francisco Chronicle depicts elderly people living with HIV since the 1980s as forgotten: left unsupported facing old age with little security, community, or assistance from the government. Does Kramer think the few, like him, who made it have been forgotten? Thats a very good question, he says. Its beginning to be talked about a little bit. Finally. But the answer is many of these people dont have partners and as you get old and your health becomes more complicated you really need a partner to help you get through all of this. A lot dont have proper insurance and they lead sad lives with decreased mobility. Its not a subject you hear much talked about, but it should be. When BuzzFeed News probes into Kramers current health he seems sanguine, offering, I dont feel well a lot of the time. The things bothering me now are mostly due to old age. My T-cells [the chief markers of the immune system] slowly continue to decline although Im told its still within the safety range. I dont know what happens when they arent and I worry about that, but I tend to worry about almost anything. He laughs again. He says the most painful part of watching the documentary was seeing himself in hospital recovering from the transplant. Fortunately Im married to a wonderful man and he hasnt let me feel too sorry for myself. Mike Coppola / Getty Images Getty Larry Kramer and his husband David Webster In any case, Kramer is still furiously busy working. Hes finished the sequel to The Normal Heart, and says he is awaiting details from HBO about a televised adaptation. He has the second instalment of The American People to finish the first is 777 pages long. And he is working on a production of his play A Minor Dark Age. Did he ever think he would live this long? No, I did not, he says flatly. But I still have things to say. Im grateful that my mind is still very healthy. If I couldnt write I would rather be dead. There is a piece of footage in the documentary in which Kramer likens living amid the AIDS crisis or plague as he would have it with living through a war. BuzzFeed News asks what psychological effects remain from that war, but Kramer sidesteps the question. The war is still going on, he says, with a glimmer of his old rhetoric. It fuels my anger. It gives me energy to fight. Entwined with this notorious fury is something else: unstinting certainty. I dont regret anything Ive done, he reflects. I dont know whether they were mistakes or not. I dont think they were. Everything I say, and said, to me seems so obvious. Attempts by BuzzFeed News to prompt self-examination are not wholly successful. What was beneath all that anger? He replies: You mean, am I a pussycat? He roars with laughter. View this image  Kramer at the 2011 Tony Awards Andrew H. Walker / Getty Images No, says BuzzFeed News, what was really informing the anger? Was it hurt? Frustration? I dont think theres anything behind the anger thats not upfront I just believe that gay people deserve the same thing as straight people have in every possible field and its not fair we dont, he says. So the fact that something is so patently unfair continues to be on top of my anger and underneath it. Without pausing he adds, Im just as angry now as I was in the very beginning, its just that Im older and it may sound different coming from an older man its not yelling so much as explaining. In the spirit, then, of passing down knowledge, what would Kramers advice be to a young gay person today? Be proud that you are gay, he says. You belong to a very distinguished history and culture. Be proud of it. Be proud of yourself. Make being gay the most important thing in your life. Stop hiding behind it and fight for whatever youre not getting. The warrior, the man who buried 18 friends in as many months before burying many more, who has lived with HIV since 1988, who has won fame and acclaim while being attacked from every side, seems in the end more like a lioness, protecting, roaring. He adds that he loves gay people, loves being gay, and simply wants everyone to feel that way. And so, as the conversation reaches the end BuzzFeed News thanks him, not only for his time but for his work. A writer, after all, who does not at least infuriate some people is not worth much. Despite the many plaudits he has received, along with decades of praise from various quarters, Larry Kramers tone suddenly changes, brightening with humility. Oh thank you, he says, touched.

aS"Gov. Bill Haslam is worried that if lawmakers pass a bill to ban transgender students from certain restrooms, public schools could lose federal funding, his spokesperson told BuzzFeed News. View this image  AP / Mark Humphrey Republican Gov. Bill Haslam worries that public schools in Tennessee could lose federal funding if lawmakers pass a bill to ban transgender students from school restrooms that correspond with their gender identity, a spokesperson for Haslam told BuzzFeed News. The governor does have financial concerns over the loss of Title IX funding, Jennifer Donnals, the press secretary for Haslam, told BuzzFeed News in reference to a 1972 federal law that bans discrimination on the basis of sex in public schools. Under Obama, the Education Department has interpreted that law to also ban anti-transgender discrimination. Currently in Tennessee, this issue is being handled on a local basis, situation by situation, Donnals continued, responding to a question from BuzzFeed News about whether the bill could clash with federal policy. The governor trusts our teachers and local school boards to make necessary accommodations in those situations. Tennessee legislators are scheduled to consider the bill in a house subcommittee next week. Although still its nascent stages, it is notable as the first bill of its type to advance since South Dakota Gov. Dennis Daugaard vetoed a similar measure in February. Explaining his veto, Daugaard told lawmakers he feared it could expose the state to federal lawsuits. National Republicans and conservative groups have placed a priority this year on state legislatures passing bills to restrict restroom access for transgender students as a backlash to the Obama administration. But both governors Haslam and Dauggard are Republicans, and their resistance to these bills may show unwillingness to tangle with federal lawyers over transgender student rights. An unprecedented two-dozen anti-transgender bills have been filed in state legislatures this year but to date, no state has ever enacted a law to ban transgender students from school restrooms. Tennessees House Bill 2414 states: Public schools shall require that a student use student restroom and locker room facilities that are assigned for use by persons of the same sex as the sex indicated on the students original birth certificate. The House Education Administration and Planning Subcommittee is scheduled to hear the bill on March 15. The bill does not mention transgender people specifically, but it is the latest step in a conservative effort nationwide to ban transgender people from using restrooms that reflect their gender identity. Campaigns have united around a battle cry of banning men in womens bathrooms to push such policies and to block LGBT nondiscrimination laws arguing that they are protecting women and girls from sex predators. Letting boys into girls restrooms and changing areas, for example, is an invasion of privacy and a threat to student safety, said a statement from Matt Sharp, legal counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which promotes such bills. In January, the Republican National Committee approved a resolution encouraging states to pass bills like the ones in Tennessee and as a backlash to the Obama administrations overreach on transgender student rights. Under President Obama, federal agencies have interpreted Title IX of the Education Act of 1972 which bans discrimination in publicly funded schools on the basis of sex to also ban transgender discrimination as a form of sex discrimination. The Department of Education has pushed several school districts into compliance when local officials attempted to deny transgender students access to school restrooms. In courts again citing Title IX the Justice Department has supported a transgender student in the lawsuit over student restroom access that has proceeded the furthest in court. Heeding that precedent, South Dakotas Gov. Daugaard vetoed the bill in his state, arguing it would put every school district in the difficult position of following state law while knowing it openly invites federal litigation. LGBT advocacy groups and businesses have opposed the bills. Hedy Weinberg, executive director of the ACLU of Tennessee, told BuzzFeed News in a statement, This legislation calls for one group of students to be treateddifferently from others, which is discrimination, pure and simple. Codifying such discrimination into law serves only to have a devastating impacton young people who are already under tremendous stress and at greater risk ofbullying, she said. Rep. Susan Lynn, the sponsor of the Tennessee bill, did not respond to BuzzFeed News requests for comment. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The bill would create a constitutional amendment that protects religious people and organizations opposed to same-sex marriage. View this image  Missouri Senate President Pro Tem Ron Richard. AP Kelley Mccall After breaking a Democratic attempt to block the legislation earlier this week, Republicans who dominate the Missouri State Senate led a 23-7 vote on Thursday to pass a bill that would protect religious people, religious organizations, and certain businesses opposed to same-sex marriage. The bill goes next to the state house, where Democrats are outnumbered more than two to one. Democrats were also outnumbered for the senate vote by a three to one margin. But they attracted national attention with a record-breaking, 39-hour filibuster that started Monday a procedural effort to stop legislation they said would enshrine discrimination into the constitution. Yet again on Thursday, Democratic senators held up the chamber for several hours by debating how the filibuster would be documented in the senates official journal. The debate was a furious game of parliamentary Twister in part over whether lawmakers had observed senate rules but the underlying theme was Democrats attempting once more to block the bill. Senate Joint Resolution 39 would create a constitutional amendment that prohibits the state from penalizing clergy, religious organizations, individuals, and certain businesses who act on their religious beliefs against marriage between two people of the same sex. Republican Sen. Bob Onder, the bills sponsor, issued a statement responding to the bills critics this week, saying, We are fighting for fairness and the right for people to freely live out their faith while not infringing on the rights of others. This is not about discrimination. SJR 39 is one of dozens of religious freedom bills filed in legislatures around the country an unprecedented number, filed as a conservative backlash to the Supreme Courts ruling last summer that legalized same-sex marriage in all 50 states. House Speaker Todd Richardson, a Republican, did not respond to questions from BuzzFeed News about whether his chamber would try to pass the bill. However, Richardson is likely to face a crush of pressure from corporations, which have increasingly leaned on legislators to block anti-LGBT bills in state legislatures. During this weeks filibuster of SJR 39, for example, Dow Chemical, Missouri-based Monsanto, and the St. Louis chamber of commerce announced their opposition. Because Missouris bill concerns a constitutional amendment, SJR 39 does not require approval from of Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, who opposes it as discriminatory. He said in a statement this week, the measure would be contrary to our values and be harmful to our economy. If passed by the house, the bill must be approved by popular vote at the ballot. SJR 39 would protect religious organizations even if they are only religious in part for taking action based on their opposition to same-sex couples marrying. Those organizations could include a religious society, corporation, entity, school, ministry, charity, social service provider, and others. Further, it would protect individuals including a closely held commercial entity from refusing goods of expression or artistic creation for a same-sex wedding. The state would be barred from penalizing, taxing, denying a tax exemption, refusing a license, terminating a contract, and taking various other actions against a qualified entity. Missouri lacks a state law protecting LGBT people from discrimination. Still, LGBT advocates warned the measure, if passed, would create a constitutionally dubious double-standard because it singles out one type of person those in a same-sex marriage for discrimination.

aS"The porn stars company faces $77,875 in fines for nine violations, including performers not using condoms on set, California officials said Wednesday. Deen responded Thursday to say no one had contracted any illness on his sets. View this image  AP / David Azia An adult film company owned by porn star James Deen is facing $77,875 in fines for workplace safety violations, including $18,000 for failing to use condoms on set, California officials announced Wednesday. Investigators at Cal/OSHA the California Department of Industrial Relations Division of Occupational Safety and Health found that last fall, Third Rock Enterprises violated the states bloodborne pathogens standard. The rules are designed to protect workers from infections that include HIV and hepatitis. Officials have interpreted those standards to mandate that a barrier be used when potentially infectious materials contact mucous membranes for example, a penis in a vagina. Cal/OSHA cited the company, which does business as James Deen Productions, with nine violations. Four are classified as serious including one that states the employer failed to require the use of engineering controls (condoms) and work practice controls (condoms) to eliminate or minimize employee exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials during the production activities associated with adult content videos or media. Another citation alleges the company failed to provide a vaccine or follow-up examination to employees potentially exposed to hepatitis B. Five citations were classified as general or regulatory, such as $350 for failing to post a worker safety notice. Cal/OSHA Chief Juliann Sum said in a statement that the company failed to protect employees from illness and injury while on set. The fines are described as proposed penalties, and Deens company can appeal the decision. A spokesperson for Cal/OSHA could not confirm to BuzzFeed News if Deen was on the set or what evidence the inspectors used as the basis for the citations such as witnessing comdomless sex during a shoot. Brian Sevilla, who goes by the stage name James Deen, responded to the allegations Thursday. An excerpt from his statement, which appears in full at the bottom of this article, states: At no time did any performer contract any illness or suffer any injury while working for James Deen Productions. None of the citations issued by Cal/OSHA even allege that there was any actual injury or illness that occurred. The vast majority of the $77,875.00 in fines was for potential exposure, not actual injuries or even an actual exposure to any illness. It must be noted that this Cal/OSHA investigation was not instituted at the request of any adult performer that worked for James Deen Productions nor was it instituted by Cal/OSHA directly. Rather, it was solely based on a complaint filed by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation with Cal/OSHA in their attempt to use California tax-payer resources to further their political and moral agenda of condoms in porn. One of the serious citations was for a film in which James Deen performed only oral sex on his female co-performers. There was not a single act of penis to vagina penetrative sex in that film. However, Cal/OSHA has made the determination that oral sex performed on a female can lead to serious bodily injury or death. This is simply not supported by medical science. The head of the leading porn industry trade association considered the proposed fines overblown. I think this is a bit far fetched, Eric Paul Leue, executive director of the Free Speech Coalition, told BuzzFeed News. View this image  Gabriel Bouys / AFP / Getty Images He noted that proposed fines have been reduced for other studios in the past. We know cases where much higher penalties were proposed and then were reduced to a $700 fine for not having a fire extinguisher, he said. Leue also argued that the timing of the citations was politically motivated. In February, a California state board failed to pass new regulations that would clarify rules for workplace safety on adult film sets, saying officials needed to collaborate more closely with the porn industry. The same division tasked with revising a new proposal for adult film sets issued the citation on Wednesday. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation said it filed the complaint that launched the investigation, which began Dec. 8, and they lauded the citation. We want to thank Cal/OSHA for acting so swiftly on our workplace safety complaint against James Deen Productions and Third Rock by citing and fining Deen, one of the industrys most well-known producers and adult performers and the one who is the most vocal critic and prominent public face of the industry in its opposition to condom use, Michael Weinstein, president of AIDS Healthcare Foundation, said in a statement. In the weeks before the complaint, women alleged that Deen had sexually assaulted them. Deen has said he is shocked and baffled by those allegations. Cal/OSHA did not cite Deens company for assault or sexual misconduct. View this embed  View this embed   Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Think you know what a feminist looks like? Think again. View this image  When society hears feminist they automatically see a woman, not a man, he explained in a brief interview with Wildfang. What people fail to realize is feminism is a movement and a belief that supports the equality of women. I can only hope that when my three daughters are out in the real world on their own, they are judged based on experience, education, their morals and beliefs, and not on their gender. View this image  People dont understand that sex work is a true model for how consent SHOULD work, said Elle. I provide access to my time and body in exchange for money. I am a gatekeeper for this access, and my clients do not receive service if they do not respect me or my boundaries. View this image  I think some may be surprised to hear that I identify as feminist depending on how they define it and whether or not they see my hijab as a symbol for feminism or oppression, she said. Feminism to me is being able to remove all the checked boxes that define a person based on cultural expectations and societal norms, and being able to define yourself based on your own values and ideologies. We live in a time of injustice, inequitable access, and hatred towards different identities. As a country that constantly talks about equal rights and justice, weve failed, and we must change that. View this image  I probably get judged for being a beauty queen, but being a feminist isnt about what job you do or how you look, its about treating each other with respect and allowing each person to make their own choices without being held back or restricted. View this image  Sadly, the Christian church, for almost its entire history, has too often been used to justify and bolster patriarchy, racism, and inequality, he said. Because of this, the church has become synonymous with all these evils for many people, and sometimes they are surprised to hear the true spiritual life of compassion and equality articulated by a Christian Minister. But my read of the scriptures leads me to believe that Jesus himself was a feminist, so how can I not do my best to follow this example? View this image  Some people think young girls cant have opinions or be activists, she said. I am a feminist because I believe gender does not matter, we should all be equals. We are all humans; living, using, and relying on this earth. View this image  I am a Republican man so some (false) stereotypes might suggest that I cannot also be a feminist, but I thoroughly support the idea of equal opportunity for all women, he said. The term feminist has picked up radical connotations in the past, but to me equality isnt radical. View this image  The leading Republican candidate has disparaged women for breast feeding and menstruating; in 2015 alone, 17 states passed more than 50 abortion restrictions and 11 states slashed funding to Planned Parenthood; and women are underrepresented at an executive level in almost every Fortune 500 company, she said.

aS"Piper Kermans number one goal is to reduce the number of people in prison. Heres why. View this image  Yaya Stempler She spent 13 months at a correctional centre in Danbury, Connecticut, from February 2004. As a white, middle-class prisoner, Kerman quickly became aware of the ways the prison system fails Americans but particularly poor Americans, and people of colour. Since her stint behind bars, shes become a vocal advocate for prisoners rights. Shes been on the board of the Womens Prison Association for six years and teaches nonfiction writing in two prisons in Ohio. And in a move that brought her story to prominence, she also wrote a memoir that served as the inspiration for hugely popular Netflix show Orange Is the New Black. Kerman recently spoke at the All About Women festival at the Sydney Opera House and sat down with BuzzFeed News. View this image  Ian Waldie / Getty Images My fundamental and most important goal is to reduce the number of people sent to prison in the first place, Kerman says. Prison is very, very punitive. In America, at least, it is not rehabilitative. She says asking questions like Why do we punish? and What do we expect from punishment? is essential. Theres retribution that age-old eye-for-an-eye kind of thing. But if we expect restoration, rehabilitation, change then we have to do things differently. Women offer a crystallizing example of stupid uses of prisons, Kerman says. The vast majority of women we incarcerate are not there for violent crimes, are not criminal kingpins, but are there for low level-offences tethered to poverty. When Kerman came out of prison, people were really interested in what she had just experienced. But most people assumed Kerman had been beaten up by hardened thugs every day, or, alternatively, that she had been kept busy by all the constructive programs and learning opportunities. Nope to both, says Kerman. Theres a persistent idea that what happens in US prison and jail is rehabilitative, that its a punishment that gains a good result, she says. Its really about warehousing people. View this image  Jesse Grant / Getty Images Kerman teaches nonfiction writing at a mens prison and a womens prison in Ohio. Each week, her eager students read the story of someone whos been touched by prisons and jails people who have done time, their loved ones, former guards, counsellors and discuss it. Then they write their own stories. Its hard to imagine a more silenced group of human beings than prisoners, Kerman says. One of the things you regain by writing is that sense of agency, that sense of yourself creating your own life. View this image  Scott Olson / Getty Images In the US, a womans kids are five times more likely to enter the foster system when their mother is incarcerated than when their father is, Kerman says. The punishment isnt just felt by those who break the law. The Womens Prison Association (WPA) tries to combat this in two ways. Firstly, it advocates for diversion programs in other words, programs that take things like motherhood into account and try to find alternatives to prison. And for mothers who do end up in prison, the WPA runs reunification housing, to help moms get on their feet and seek custody again. In a place like New York, [regaining parental rights] is an incredibly challenging thing, because you must be able to afford housing which is safe and large enough for your entire family, Kerman says. View this image  Andrew Burton / Getty Images Kermans privilege as a white, middle-class woman permeates her advocacy. Shes hyper-aware of how these factors made her incredibly lucky in terms of navigating the American justice system. We have a criminal justice system that is profoundly racist, and profoundly unjust to poor people, she says. That was apparent from the very first day in prison. And thats something I think about every day. Its also about recognising that we as a society dont have sympathy for certain groups, Kerman says. When I teach in the mens prison, the stories these men write about their lives reveal terrible victimisation, she says. We find it hard to perceive men of colour from poor communities as victims, because we always cast them as villains. Thats a huge problem. View this image  Netflix Kerman says the use of humour in Orange Is the New Black doesnt make light of prison but rather, is a valuable tool to help people understand. The show has a provocative marriage of drama and humour, she says. I think the use of humour to analyse the world is incredibly useful. Bluntly, some of the issues that lodge in our prisons and jails are so difficult and so horrific that its hard to get people to think about them. Humour is an incredible survival skill. In prison, there are times when if you dont laugh you would cry. View this image  Kerman with Taylor Schilling, who plays Piper Chapman in OITNB. Craig Barritt / Getty Images Piper Chapman is a creation of Taylor Schillings acting and Jenji Kohans writing, says Kerman. The show makes these huge departures from the true story of my own life. One of [Kohans] brilliant choices is not to have this Walter White, Tony Soprano, single-character protagonist. To me, thats an outdated way of looking at the world. Instead, its an incredible array of overwhelmingly female protagonists. Why shouldnt Piper Chapman be a villain? But what side of the love/hate Piper divide does she fall on? I love all the characters, she says diplomatically. Except Pornstache. Hes hard to love. Prison or jail is not a safe place, she says. Its a strange place with complicated rules, layers of power, often things are not what they seem. Both for your own safety and sanity, you have to understand the context in which youre living. Its dramatically different to the free world.  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"As an unincorporated territory, the judge ruled, the Supreme Courts ruling on marriage bans doesnt automatically apply to Puerto Rico. [Update: Puerto Ricos governor says in a statement that he will continue to follow the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on marriage.] View this image  People celebrate outside the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., on June 26, 2015 after its historic decision on marriage equality. Mladen Antonov / AFP / Getty Images WASHINGTON Puerto Ricos marriage ban remains valid and the law of the territory, a federal judge ruled on Tuesday. [Update: On Wednesday, however, the governor of Puerto Rico said in a statement that he will continue to follow the U.S. Supreme Court and First Circuit Court of Appeals rulings that such marriage bans are unconstitutional.] Because Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory, the Supreme Courts ruling on same-sex couples marriage rights does not automatically apply there, U.S. District Court Judge Juan Prez-Gimnez ruled in a 10-page decision on Tuesday. The judge had previously upheld the marriage ban in Puerto Rico in October 2014, before the U.S. Supreme Court struck down marriage bans nationwide in Obergefell v. Hodges. After the Supreme Courts ruling in Obergefell, both the plaintiffs and territorys defendants agreed that the ban was now unconstitutional. So did the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals, to whom the plaintiffs had appealed Prez-Gimnezs ruling. The 1st Circuit vacated the district court ruling upholding the ban and sent it back to the district court for further consideration in light of Obergefell v. Hodges in a July 8, 2015, order. Going further still, the court noted, We agree with the parties joint position that the ban is unconstitutional. Back at the district court, the parties filed a joint motion for an entry of judgment on July 16, 2015, noting, in light of Obergefell v. Hodges and the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, the parties hereby jointly move this Court to enter the enclosed proposed judgment in favor of Plaintiffs. Without any further briefing on the matter, Prez-Gimnez denied that request on Monday. View this image  View this image  View this image  View this image  View this image  Shortly after the opinion was released, however, ACLU attorney Joshua Block noted a 1976 Supreme Court decision stating that, despite ambiguity overall regarding how and when the U.S. Constitution applies to Puerto Rico, It is clear now, however, that the protections accorded by either the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment or the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment apply to residents of Puerto Rico. Omar Gonzalez-Pagan, staff attorney for Lambda Legal, which is representing the plaintiffs, called the rulingaberrant and fundamentally flawed and incongruent with the constitutional principles applicable to all persons in the United States, whether they live in a state or territory and whether they are straight or gay. Echoing Blocks comment, he added, The U.S. Supreme Court has unequivocally stated that the constitutional promises of liberty and equality apply with equal force to residents of Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit was clear when it stated that Puerto Ricos marriage ban was unconstitutional. An appeal of the judges decision back to the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals is expected.

aS"Behind the happy, smiling faces is one simple message for the government. View this image  The song booms from the float behind us. As I sneak glances at the bright young things I dance beside, I wonder how often this group of LGBT teenagers get to feel like they have the whole world rooting for them. Its Mardi Gras night in Sydney and Im with Wear It Purple, a not-for-profit organisation who work to empower, educate, and support queer youth. Tonight they provide something these young people dont always have: a safe space to celebrate their sexuality. Gyan Yankovich Gyan Yankovich Bella is a year 8 student and identifies as pansexual, meaning shes attracted to people of all gender identities. Along with her mum and step-dad, shes going to march in the parade tonight and celebrate her queer identity, in spite of the criticism shes faced. I ask her why she decided to march today. She pauses and then says: Hopefully my dad sees this, somehow. Im still not sure if hes supportive. Nobody used to say anything to my face. Theyd write notes and leave them in my tray, which was maybe even worse. I was always left wondering who it was. You know, was it one of my friends? I asked her what the notes used to say and she references the F-word. Not fuck, shes talking about faggot. Bellas new school has its own LGBT support group, that meets weekly. Her school also hosted a Wear It Purple day, which is how she found out about the organisation. As the night goes on, I find that almost all of the young people marching today have found the group through school programs. Gyan Yankovich Gyan Yankovich I find out that several members of the group identify as a non-binary gender and that almost all of the young people I speak to identify as pansexual. It seems teenagers have a more fluid view of sexuality and gender than generations past. One of the pansexual, non-binary identifying people I speak with is 14-year-old Louie, who prefers they/them pronouns. Theyre easily spotted in the crowd with a perfect rainbow painted over the shaved side of their head. Im out at school. Im out everywhere, they tell me. Louie is intelligent, loud, and above all else, aware. Hes an old white dude; everyone listens to him, they say. I hate that. I tell Louie that theyre one of the most confident young people Ive met not just today, but ever. The look of shock on their face makes me realise that Im meeting these teenagers in what could be the safest environment theyve ever been in; these passionate, intelligent voices may not be the ones these teens use every day. As I speak to these young people, they all have one message for the government: Stop making decisions for LGBT teens, without speaking to them first. instagram.com Instagram: @chandravidar When I first found an online community of asexual people, I realised Im not the only person who feels this way, says 19-year-old Chandra, who identifies as graysexual; a place on the asexuality scale where some sexual attraction does occur, but rarely. Twitter and Tumblr are where I found my community. Before finding these online spaces, Chandra had thought that she was perhaps just a really good Christian, when in reality, she just didnt know a label for her sexuality even existed. But what of the students whove not found Wear It Purple or a community online? What of the teens still dont feel safe in public or at home? View this image  View this image  Closing the walk he tries to explain over the crowds roar that its hard to be so open, after so long being so closed. And I get it. Not every queer person opens metaphorical rainbow flood gates when they come out. For some, the process is more like a drizzle. And it can take some getting used to. The LGBT youth of tonights parade may not have the same struggles as the original protesters of 1978, but that doesnt mean they dont have battles to fight. And I like to think that this is what the crowd are cheering for as we walk together. I like to believe that the spectators understand that the possibility of an equal future lies in the hands of these young people. Lucky for all of us, I am beyond confident that these hands are not only strong enough to carry the burden, but are damn ready to grab onto it. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS'The filmmaker wrote in a statement to the Windy City Times that she was coming out in response to pressure from a tabloid reporter. This story has been updated with a comment from DailyMail.com. View this image  The Windy City Times published this selfie of Lilly Wachowski. Via windycitymediagroup.com Lilly Wachowski, the filmmaker who rose to prominence with the 1999 film The Matrix, came out as transgender in a statement to Chicagos Windy City Times March 8. The writer, director, and producer, whose sister, Lana, came out as transgender in 2012, wrote that she was already living as an out transgender person but hadnt formally announced her transition yet. In her statement, Wachowski said she decided to come out after a reporter from the Daily Mail knocked on her door and asked to interview her about her gender identity, which she had not yet discussed publicly. She recalled that the Daily Mail was the same media organization that nationally outed an elementary school teacher who later killed herself, and rather than speak further with the Mail reporter, Wachowski opted to come out to a local LGBT media outlet. (She grew up in the Chicago area.) Despite coming out under outside pressure, the filmmakers statement contained moments of humor. She began it with the salacious headline shed been expecting for a year, SEX CHANGE SHOCKER WACHOWSKI BROTHERS NOW SISTERS!!! She also cited the high rates of violence and murder against transgender people, threats that inform the recommendations of GLAAD and other LGBT organizations that media outlets refrain from outing trans people. She said that shes one of the lucky ones because she can afford doctors and therapists to not only transition which she said she has done but to actually survive this process. And she also noted she has the support of her family, friends, and colleagues. Everyone is cool with it, she wrote. Yes, thanks to my fabulous sister theyve done it before, but also because theyre fantastic people. Without the love and support of my wife and friends and family I would not be where I am today. Wachowski took control of her narrative, saying, We need to elevate the dialogue beyond the simplicity of binary. Binary is a false idol. Citing the scholar Jos Muoz, she wrote, I will continue to be an optimist adding my shoulder to the Sisyphean struggle of progress and in my very being, be an example of the potentiality of another world. You can read Wachowskis statement in full on Windy City Times. Besides The Matrix franchise, the Wachowskis wrote and produced V for Vendetta in 2006, they wrote and directed Speed Racer in 2008, co-wrote and co-directed Cloud Atlas in 2012, and found cult success with the 2015 film Jupiter Ascending, which they wrote, directed, and produced. Most recently, they released the series Sense8 on Netflix, which featured a trans character played by a trans actor. BuzzFeed News has reached out to Wachowskis representative. UPDATE When reached for comment, a representative for DailyMail.com told BuzzFeed News that the publication categorically denies that the reporter who appeared on the filmmakers doorstep tried to coerce Lilly Wachowski into revealing her gender transition. The statement goes on to say DailyMail.com made absolutely clear multiple times that they were only interested in reporting the story if and when she was happy to do so and with her cooperation and that the reporter was extremely sympathetic and courteous at all times. In their statement, the publication also denied outing Lucy Meadows, the elementary school teacher to whom Wachowski referred in her statement, noting that Meadows did not mention the press or The Daily Mail in her suicide note. The statement differentiated DailyMail.com from the newspaper The Daily Mail, which ran a column referring to Meadows with male pronouns and stating, he isnt entitled to project his personal problems on to impressionable young children.

aS"American Crime creator John Ridley and stars Felicity Huffman, Connor Jessup, and Joey Pollari tell BuzzFeed News how socially responsible storytelling turned the ABC drama into the most daring TV show in years. View this image  American Crime stars Connor Jessup and Lili Taylor with creator and executive producer John Ridley. Felicia Graham / ABC There is nothing on television quite like American Crime. In the current second season of the ABC drama, viewers have been gripped by a scandal in an Indiana community after one closeted high school student accuses another of rape. Boys dont get raped, Regina Kings character, Terri LaCroix, says. But of course, thats not true, and American Crime has been shattering those kind of outdated myths about sexual assault as Taylor Blaine (Connor Jessup) and Eric Tanner (Joey Pollari) have become embroiled in a battle that has taken over their small town. Season 1 of creator John Ridleys anthology series which dealt with racism, drug addiction, and murder received glowing reviews, and was nominated for 10 Emmys, one of which it won (Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or a Movie for Kings astounding performance). For Season 2, Ridley doubled-down on what made his critical darling so successful: socially relevant themes, no holds barred writing, groundbreaking direction, and bold editing choices. Weve seen all kinds of shows go into a second season and sometimes theyre not as good, Ridley told BuzzFeed News during a phone interview. Its incumbent on the people involved to learn from everything we did and improve. View this image  Timothy Hutton and Felicity Huffman in American Crime Season 2. Ryan Green / ABC The sophomore season of American Crime shifts the focus from Modesto, California, to Indianapolis, Indiana specifically a private school, run with a steely ferocity by Felicity Huffmans Leslie Graham. One of its students, Taylor who attends the prestigious Leyland School on scholarship alleges that another student, Eric, drugged him at a party and raped him, but he doesnt come forward at first. Its only after scandalous photos from the evening in question begin circulating online and result in Taylors expulsion from Leyland that his mother, Anne Blaine (a never better Lili Taylor), learns what her son says he experienced that night and reports the alleged crime to the police. What unfolds is a powerful and rarely seen examination of what its like to be closeted in small-town America, the lengths the rich and powerful will go to protect themselves, and, eventually, a school shooting. Education, family, socioeconomic differences, sexual orientation, violence in our schools, cyberbullying many of the themes that weave through the second season, everyones had direct experience with those things, Huffman told BuzzFeed News in a phone interview. The first season, when youre dealing with drug dealers and murder, the majority has hopefully only heard about that intellectually or through the news. This one hits a little closer to our hearts. View this image  Jessup. ABC Thats particularly true of the seasons harrowing seventh episode in light of the 64 school shootings that occurred in the U.S. in 2015. In the installment, which aired on Feb. 17 and was written and directed by Ridley, Taylor hits a low after being physically and emotionally beaten down as a result of coming forward about the assault. He decides to steal a gun, down a bunch of drugs, and exact revenge on the people who scorned him: first Leslie, the headmaster of the school that turned his attack back on him; then Kevin LaCroix (Trevor Jackson), the basketball captain who hosted the party where he was allegedly assaulted; then Wes Baxter (Michael Seitz), the main aggressor in the group of students that gay-bashed him; and finally, of course, Eric. View this image  Merrilee McCommas in American Crime Season 2. ABC As Taylor waits outside Leslies office, gun cloaked, ready to avenge, a single voice sobers him up. I thought the school could have handled your situation better, Leslies assistant Grace (Merrilee McCommas) offers as tears begin to form in her eyes. I see things here sometimes and I think you deserve better than how you were treated a lot of us do. Its a moment of emotional solace that Taylor desperately needs: true compassion without any ulterior motive. And it reminds him that there are people who love and support him. Taylor abandons the plan, but as he is exiting school property, he runs into Wes, who, assuming Taylor has reported the assault, grabs him and threatens to kill him. While the audience doesnt see or hear the gunshot that follows, what they do see is a wave of disbelief ripple across Taylors face and Wes fall to the ground, blood rushing from a wound in his stomach that later kills him. With that episode, American Crime did the seemingly unthinkable by asking viewers to sympathize with a school shooter. And thanks to one of the years best television performances, Jessup managed to earn that empathy. View this image  Joey Pollari Ryan Green / ABC What I was really worried about going into filming, and this is even before I knew what the season would be in its entirety, was that it would make Taylor feel like nothing but a victim in a very one-dimensional, flat way, Jessup told BuzzFeed News in a phone interview. Its almost like once you check the victim with a big V box, you dont necessarily pay attention to them anymore because you just think, Oh, that character is nothing more than a victim. I think were used to seeing victims on TV in a very Law and Order kind of way and it was really important to me that people not react to Taylor that way. And for the most part, that doesnt seem to be peoples reaction. Jessup said hes gotten letters from viewers whove appreciated seeing Taylor struggle and not just have it be in the background or plot device for a single episode, but an actual examination of what its like to be a victim of a crime like that. To Pollaris surprise, the audience has been equally invested in Erics journey, despite the fact he is at least at first the accused perpetrator of a sexual assault. I definitely thought the whole time he was going to be a completely unlikable character, but the show is so well-crafted that they do give you peeks into that heart hes trying so desperately to protect, Pollari told BuzzFeed News during a phone interview. People are very sympathetic and it just goes to show how movies and TV shows can open peoples eyes to some much-needed understanding of difficult people in our lives. I dont think I understood the breadth of it until now. View this image  Regina King and John Ridley. Ryan Green / ABC Bringing a series to television that feels fresh and bold, especially on network television, is a challenge, but American Crime has done just that. Ridley credits that success in large part to the shows diversity both in front of and behind the camera. Not only does the cast include black, Middle Eastern, and Latino actors, but women or people of color wrote more than half of the episodes in American Crime Season 2. The writers do so much more than just put pen to paper; they offer up moments from their lives perspectives, things that happened to them, circumstances theyve been through that just add a sheen of humanity to everything thats going on, Ridley said. Additionally, women or people of color including Boys Dont Cry director and writer Kimberly Peirce and Mysterious Skin director Gregg Araki directed more than half of this seasons episodes. I say this with no disrespect to any other broadcast shows or network or cable, but in its inception, this was a show that wasnt being done, Ridley said. You dont see a lot of people of color in prominent roles, in complicated roles, and you certainly dont see enough behind the camera. View this image  Huffman with director Kimberly Peirce on the set of Episode 8 of American Crime Season 2. Ryan Green / ABC That diversity has helped American Crime stand out not only in the way its tackled prescient themes head-on, but also in how those themes were presented. Editing on the show, for example, is incredibly sparse. Every episode is dominated by lengthy, uninterrupted close-ups that linger on the actors faces, often while theyre not the ones speaking. So instead of using dialogue to tell the audience what a character is going through, their wordless reactions subtly send those messages. Why cut from Lili for two minutes? Why cut from Connor Jessup in a scene? The minute you cut away, you dissipate whats going on, Ridley said, praising American Crimes editor, Hank Corwin (an Oscar nominee this year for his work on The Big Short), for that approach. The only velocity is emotional velocity. The shows quest to honor the authenticity of every moment also manifests itself in its language. American Crime doesnt use an alternate word for a curse that would pass FCC standards or audibly bleep expletives; the show drops the audio and the video, resulting in a momentary blackout on screen. That choice was twofold: First, Ridley feels solely excising the sound in that moment can often feel like a mistake and he wanted it to be clear that these characters are not choosing their words based on broadcast standards; plus, it lends a power to the moment. View this image  Taylor. Ryan Green / ABC To say to an actor, We want you to have a really great windup in this moment, but when you get to this spot, we want you to say fudge or shoot instead, its like asking someone to throw a fastball at 32 miles per hour, Ridley said. We didnt want to dilute the run for performers. We didnt want to drop in a word that the audience would hear and think, Theyre supposed to be saying this word; thats just a reminder to the audience that its broadcast TV. Ridley was also able to mine genuine emotion from every word by only giving his actors the portions of the script in which their characters appear. I really wanted some of the characters to not have any idea whats going on in other peoples worlds, he said. There are moments where I think it throws actors off kilter in a good way. It also allowed the actors to focus on what their characters believe about the night in question. I knew what was going on with Leslie Graham, but I didnt know what was going on with Connors character or Richard Cabrals character, Huffman said. It was revelatory and new for me. And Ridleys approach was particularly imperative for Jessup and Pollari. I always told them, your truth is your truth. Youre not going to find out later that X happened, but you said Y, he explained to the actors. As the story went on, and as feelings and emotions calcify, as people become more segregated in who they are and the stance they take, for me, it just made more sense for the characters to have less sense of whats going on in someone elses world because theyre not part of that world anymore. Pollari Ryan Green / ABC Jessup Ryan Green / ABC Conventional storytelling wisdom might lead audiences to expect a flashback to illuminate the truth of what happened that fateful night in the March 9 finale or some sort of revelatory resolution in the seasons closing moments. But American Crime is anything but conventional, and those looking for answers will be disappointed. Im a huge fan of elliptical narratives where a character makes a journey but kind of ends up in a similar place to where they started, Pollari said, implying Eric may still have some emotional growing to do. Life is cyclical and we tend to go through things many times before we get ourselves out of it. It feels like the natural progression especially for a show that prides itself in dealing with the gray. Jessup, whose character has been to hell and back again, sees a silver lining in the finales shades of gray. I might be alone in this, but I actually feel that its a happy ending, he said. Not in the sense that all is right in the world but it presents a notion that is, in the long run, essentially a very optimistic one and I think it presents it in a very real way and a very unadorned way. View this image  Felicity Huffman ABC The actors on American Crime have grown accustomed to working in a world without answers, and viewers should be too because Ridley isnt interested in resolution. I dont think art is about answering questions; its about posing them, he said. If youre watching the show, you dont need someone to come in and dust their hands at the end of 42 minutes and say, Well, heres your answer. Theres nothing but questions that need to be asked and with a show like this, one of the great things is we can ask, but I think we get into a danger zone where we start proselytizing and start writing these big, long summations about how we can be better citizens. Even if American Crime doesnt provide answers, the cast hopes it ignites discussions about important topics that are often considered too taboo for primetime network television. And Huffman believes that alone has the potential to bring viewers closer to seeing even some of the most divisive issues from different perspectives. Storytelling, like any kind of art, has the innate ability to transform and to expand your experience, Huffman said. That brings understanding and usually what follows understanding is empathy. And when people have empathy for each other, the walls go down and we become more unified. Hopefully we are becoming more understanding and accepting. At least thats the goal.

aS' View this image  Democratic State Sen. Jamilah Nasheed is one of the filibuster leaders. AP / Jeff Roberson Republicans in Missouris state senate broke a 39-hour Democratic filibuster Wednesday morning, voting to advance a bill that would protect religious people and organizations opposed to same-sex marriage. The GOP state senate voted 23-9 to end debate Wednesday morning by using a rare procedural move called a previous question. The senate must pass the bill again on a final reading which is scheduled for Thursday when the senate convenes at 10 a.m. Central Time before it goes to the state house. If approved by both chambers, the bill must be approved by popular vote at the ballot. We fought the good fight today. But this is just one battle in the long war against injustice. Thanks 4 all your support,my friend! Democrats are in the legislative minority in Missouris capitol, but they seized control of the microphone on Monday afternoon by taking advantage of state rules allowing legislators to hold up a bill by talking or debating its merits, also called a filibuster. Both procedure and theater, the action drew national attention and support from major companies, presidential candidates, and the governor. I want to see us go for 24 hours, said Democratic Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal halfway through the marathon session. Democrats traded off the floor in three-hour shifts, with banter that took on the texture of a morning talk show: eyedrops, watercolor painting, health care management, and, of course, the issue at hand. They said the measure to protect those opposed to same-sex marriage would enshrine discrimination into the state constitution. At issue is Senate Joint Resolution 39, which would create a constitutional amendment that prohibits the state from penalizing clergy, religious organizations, and individuals who act on their religious beliefs against marriage between two people of the same sex. It is one of dozens of religious freedom bills filed in legislatures around the country. Republican Sen. Bob Onder, the bills sponsor, issued a statement on Tuesday responding to the bills critics. This measure does NOT discriminate, he said. We are fighting for fairness and the right for people to freely live out their faith while not infringing on the rights of others, the statement continued. Its about liberty. The Republican state caucus tweeted that the bill was a shield, not a sword. 17 hours later, Senators are still debating #SJR39. "It\'s a shield, not a sword." #ShowMeReligiousFreedom But major corporations and politicians argued otherwise. Hitting close to home, the Missouri-based agricultural giant Monsanto issued a statement Tuesday amid the filibuster when asked about rumors that the company was lobbying to defeat the measure. At Monsanto we remain committed to diversity and inclusion for all. This legislation would be contrary to that position, Monsanto spokesperson Charla Lord told BuzzFeed News. Monsanto is calling on other businesses and the agricultural community to join the company in speaking out against discrimination here in our home state of Missouri and around the world. The St. Louis chamber of commerce also weighed in, saying SJR 39 sends the message to the rest of the country that Missouri condones discrimination. The group called to amend the bill. Likewise, Dow Chemical, which maintains plants in the state, announced during the filibuster that it opposed the legislation. Dow opposes Missouri Senate Bill #SJR39 and any efforts that allow for discrimination of any colleague or citizen. Politicians, including Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, weighed in while the filibuster persevered through the Tuesday primary. Marriage equality is the law. I stand with those filibustering in MO to make sure discrimination won\'t be. -H https://t.co/u34dGDcVeY Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, also rallied for the filibuster. The bill does not require his signature to become law. Inspired by senators\' heroic stand against discrimination in #MO. The nation is watching & cheering you on! #SJR39 #NotInMyState LGBT advocates warned that Onders measure, if passed, would create a legally dubious double standard because it singles out one type of person those in a same-sex marriage for discrimination. The state cannot constitutionally prefer one set of religious beliefs (here, those opposed to marriage for same sex couples) over all other beliefs, Eunice Rho, advocacy and policy counsel for the ACLU, said in an email to BuzzFeed News. She added that the measure raises serious constitutional concerns because the Supreme Courts marriage equality ruling last June ensures same-sex couples enjoy the same constitutional right to marry as everyone else. Likewise, the Human Rights Campaign said in a statement on Tuesday that the measure is shrouded in language about protecting those with religious beliefs. But, the group argues, it opens the door to discrimination against same-sex couples. SJR 39 would protect religious organizations even if they are only religious in part for taking action based on their opposition to same-sex couples marrying. Those organizations could include a religious society, corporation, entity, partnership, order, preschool, school, institution of higher education, ministry, charity, social service provider, and others. Further, it would protect individuals including a closely held commercial entity from refusing goods of expression or artistic creation for a same-sex wedding. The state would be barred from penalizing, taxing, denying a tax exemption, refusing a license, terminating a contract, and taking various other actions against a qualified entity. Missouri lacks a state law protecting LGBT people from discrimination. The filibuster against the bill was being led by Democratic Sens. Jamilah Nasheed, Jill Schupp, Scott Sifton, Jason Holsman, Chappelle-Nadal, Joseph Keaveny, and Kiki Curls. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"I am extremely aware of all the things that make me scared. View this image  Gessen lived in Russia until her mid-teens, and then moved to the US with her family in 1981. Ten years later, she returned to Moscow on assignment. Gessen currently lives in New York City. Her latest book is about the Tsarnaev brothers, the perpetrators of the Boston Marathon bombings. Heres what she told BuzzFeed News. View this image  While Gessen has written about a wide variety of topics, her two best known books are The Man Without A Face and Words Will Break Cement: The Passion of Pussy Riot. Neither has made it into Russian. This guy at a publishing house has just bought my backlist. Hes going to translate an old book about my grandmothers, and a book about medical genetics. Not Pussy Riot, and not Putin. The publisher told Gessen he wanted to start slow, publish the safer books first and see how they went. The risks are always vague, thats the problem, she says. What would be the risks of publishing Putin? The risk might be that no bookstore would order the book, they wont be able to sell it. Thats an economic risk. Or else they put out just the ebook and then they get charged with extremism. Or they dont. He thinks hes making a smart calculation, he may well be. But in another sense, its self-censorship. No one is actually banning the Putin book. But everybody is too scared to publish it. View this image  I dont think of them as dangerous topics. They are the best stories! Gessen says. I dont feel like I have to be confrontational in the topics I choose. I am interested in the ways we think about the world, and the ways in which those ways are fucked up. View this image  I actually think I have a theory about this I think the people who look like theyre brave, from the outside, I think theyre cowards. How so? Gessen explains: Ive known many war correspondents, and they basically fall into two categories. The reckless ones, and the scared ones and Im always on the scared side. The reckless ones are the people who dont feel much fear, or get a thrill from being in physical danger. I am definitely not one of those people. When I was a war correspondent, I was always looking for ways to avoid gunfire. Its rational, says Gessen but its not brave. If youre naturally a pretty scared person, in order to function in the world, you have to be quite aware of all the things that scare you, and how youre going to deal with them. And thats why I dont think of myself as brave. I am extremely aware of all the things that make me scared. A huge consequence of the violence directed towards LGBT Russians has been a flood of refugees, says Gessen many of them in New York City, where theres an entire community who fled Putin. Gessen, who had a US passport, said she had a very soft landing compared to other Russians. I have a US passport and the Supreme Court gave us the very great gift of the Windsor decision, meaning my partner and I could get married and she could have her green card. We had the material means to buy a house before moving. I dont want to call myself a refugee, I moved. Gessen says the laws that caused this exodus are more designed to send a message than they are to be enforced. You cant enforce the homosexual propaganda laws, unless you do it selectively, she says. Once you write a law that can only be enforced selectively, then the point of it is not to have legislation, the point of it is to have a message in the public. View this image  Gessen didnt pay attention at first, mostly because the homosexual propaganda laws just seemed ridiculous. I thought they were funny, she says. And I certainly did not think they were going to affect my life. The fact Russia was slowly progressing in terms of LGBT rights before it started to backpedal in the early 2000s left LGBT people particularly vulnerable, says Gessen. You had people who were living openly. Not necessarily publicly openly, but openly to their neighbours, their kids kindergarten teachers. All of a sudden they became outlaws. They didnt have a closet to go back into, it wasnt there, she said. Which makes Russia in some ways a more dangerous place than some other countries, for individuals. Because if youve never stuck your nose out, youre less likely to be subject to attack than living this experience of being completely exposed, and all of a sudden made into a second class citizen. I tried to get a bureau job, because that seemed like a nice professional thing to do. But who was going to give a bureau job in 1991 to someone who looks like me and came from the queer press? she asks. Now I think I was so lucky, because I had to become a magazine journalist. That gave me so much more freedom than having a bureau job. And gave me more financial stability who would have thought that at the time? View this image  Her schedule, summed up: I get up at noon. I work until four in the morning. After Gessen gets up, she goes for a 30km bike ride before coming home and cooking for her household. My household is pretty expansive, she explains. I live with my partner, our three kids, my ex partner, and often theres someone else with us. And Im the cook, so I cook. We have dinner, and then I go up to my study and work until four in the morning. I have very little patience for the idea of objectivity, Gessen says. I have more patience for the idea that theres an objective style, to serve the original concept of objectivity in journalism. That original concept, says Gessen, is the idea that journalism has to be evidence based, with transparent sourcing. Im down with that, but Im not down with the idea that the journalist is some sort of hovering presence with no subjectivity, and no location. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend features a middle-aged male character who just came out as bisexual. He might be the most radically unremarkable bi guy ever to appear on television. View this image  Darryl (Pete Gardner) on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. The CW A quiet but subversive courtship has unfolded on The CWs freshman musical series Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. It began with a flirty chat on a party bus in the Jan. 25 episode. Then, there was a gentle kiss on the cheek, and a few episodes later, theres a date. Its been slow, deliberate, and sweet. The endearing will they or wont they would almost be clich if not for the fact that the romance is between a young gay man named White Josh (David Hull) and a middle-aged lawyer named Darryl (Pete Gardner) whose dorky shift into queerness might make him the most vanilla bisexual man on television. Darryl, the bumbling boss of protagonist Rebecca (Rachel Bloom), is the essence of sincerity. His joyful coming-out both to himself and to others is just this wonderful discovery, Gardner told BuzzFeed News over the phone. Theres another way to love. There are other people that might love him. This is the kind of visibility bisexual people especially bisexual men often miss out on: As GLAAD noted in its 20152016 report, the few bisexual male TV characters that exist are frequently depicted as untrustworthy, manipulative, and self-destructive. (See the duplicitous Frank Underwood on House of Cards and the scheming Tyrell Wellick on Mr. Robot.) But on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, bisexuality is an ordinary facet of a principled person. Darryls self-actualization parallels that of the shows titular crazy ex-girlfriend, who quits her job and moves across the country to pursue a likely unrequited love. Bucking the trend, Darryl is the open and honest one, where heterosexual Rebecca is semi-tortured and secretive. View this image  White Josh (David Hull) and Darryl (Pete Gardner) on a fateful party bus ride. Mike Yarish / The CW Ive gotten letters from bisexual friends that have written to me, and said that actually, when I kissed White Josh, they were holding their breath because they were just waiting for me to go, Nope! Not gay! Gardner said. [Its] like a joke, their sexual orientation. And thats just not what it is [with Darryl], and thats whats so nice about it. In the March 7 episode, Darryl comes out to his co-workers in a song that explicitly rejects misconceptions bisexual people encounter namely, the idea that bisexuality is a cover for homosexuality, or that bisexuality is a sign of confusion or promiscuity. (Lyrics include I dont have the gotta choose blues.) We definitely wanted to confront the stereotypes, series co-creator Aline Brosh McKenna told BuzzFeed News on the phone. I think that Darryl has done his research and understands that people are going to confront him with these stereotypes, and so he wants to make sure that everybody knows that those are not the issues. In the writers room, Darryl has always been bisexual, McKenna said, but the character hasnt had the vocabulary for it the first time he comes out, he literally doesnt know the word, calling himself bothsexual. Society has changed tremendously since Darryl came of age, she said, and taboos around sexuality have been, to some degree, lifted. Still, McKenna added, I think if youre a man and you are attracted to women, you sort of think, Oh, well, then I must be straight, and I can just go with that. And you dont want to upset the apple cart by trying to expand your identity into other things, because it makes people uncomfortable. Both McKenna and Gardner separately recalled the meeting between the actors and the writers during which Gardner was informed of his characters sexuality: It happened with a matter-of-factness that mirrors the no-nonsense treatment of sexuality on the show. They were like, OK, so here, in Episode 5, thats when you sing your song. And I was like, Oh boy, good to know, he remembered. Then they were like, And heres Episode 11, and youre bisexual. Bisexual? Yeah, thats right, thats where that happens. I was like, All right! Well! McKenna said both she and star/co-creator Bloom knew bisexual people in their lives, but had not often seen them depicted on television or in movies it seemed fresh and honest. And, like the writers, Gardner wasnt thinking about the character in the political terms bisexual viewers might: When asked how he felt about playing what is probably the most radically unremarkable male bisexual character on television, he laughed. Awesome! he said. I really approached this as just a love story.  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .

aS"The PFLAG float for parents and friends of LGBT people has been a Mardi Gras regular for decades. BuzzFeed News spent the night with them. View this image  Jeffrey Feng for Sydney Gay & Lesbian Mardi Gras Narelle Phipps cant quite remember what year she joined PFLAG. It was before the days of the web and so on, she says. The president at the time lived near us, and put a whole lot of reading material in our letterbox. Shes standing in Sydneys Hyde Park, a couple of hours before the annual Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras parade kicks off. The park is abuzz with revellers drifting excitedly towards the glittery floats lining up along Liverpool Street. A boisterous marching band rehearses to the left, a troupe of glamorous dancers carefully step out a routine to the right. But Phipps is focused on the question. Neil, what year did we join PFLAG? Her son, tall and in his late 30s, looks up from a conversation with his boyfriend. Well, I came out in 96, he says. So maybe it was 96, Phipps muses. Would that work? They go to and fro, and decide yes, it must have been 1996. And then Phipps realises. Thats 20 years! Neils reaction is immediate: he opens up his arms and pulls his mother into a warm embrace. As they mark the milestone, surrounded by the chaos of Mardi Gras, time seems to slow; the intimacy of the moment lingering for longer than the physical second it took. And then its over, but the night has just begun. Phipps and Neil are marching with PFLAG, formerly known as Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays. Founded in New York City in 1972, the group is now embedded in LGBT culture, with hundreds of chapters in countries across the globe. As the Australian chapter assembles in Hyde Park, one thing becomes clear: PFLAG is straight edge. The float dress code is a white top or official PFLAG shirt, paired with dark slacks or a skirt. President Judy Brown wanders around with a clipboard, doling out rainbow lanyards and badges to those who have turned up without them. Probably three out of four marchers are wearing joggers. Its a stark contrast to the wild and wonderful costumes of other floats. But PFLAG isnt in the parade to be a fabulous spectacle. Theyre there to make a simple point: we love our LGBT children and friends. View this image  Lane Sainty / BuzzFeed The group has guided thousands of parents through their childs coming out process, offering a helping hand to parents who are struggling, and an avenue to advocacy for those who want to fight for their childs rights. Mostly, the people assembled to march are parents but there are scattered siblings, relatives and friends too. Natalie Cooper, currently the NSW PFLAG secretary, is handing out wristbands to the marchers. The F in PFLAG, Cooper joined as a way to support her gay and lesbian friends. Sometimes were a little bit too laid back, she says. Sometimes we need to acknowledge that unless you stand up and push, nothing will change. For those of us who have nothing to lose, especially straight supporters, its about time we stood up and started putting ourselves out there, fighting for our friends rights. After about an hour assembling in Hyde Park, the group picks up and enters the marshalling area, where the real fun starts. Theres nothing quite like the pre-parade Mardi Gras vibe anything goes, and everyone is buzzing. Lane Sainty / BuzzFeed Lane Sainty / BuzzFeed Amidst the hubbub, Les Mic is carefully checking the rainbow flags fastened to the PFLAG ute. Its been 19 years since Mic and his wife Sue listened to their eldest son tell them he was gay, at age 18. Two years later, when their other son turned 18, he, too, came out of the closet. Weve been in the committee from almost the word go, Mic says. We wanted our kids to know that we were right beside them, ready to walk with them anywhere they went. Reality is, theyve walked us into some beautiful areas, that we would never have had the opportunity to go to otherwise. Mic said his kids probably werent expecting the warm reception all those years ago. But he and Sue quickly realised that if they didnt get on board, they might lose their sons. Our lives wouldnt be worth it without them, he says. Inwardly, we were torn. But we werent going to let them see that in the beginning. View this image  Lane Sainty / BuzzFeed After another hour of lingering in the marshalling area, the powers that be start to assemble the scattered PFLAG-ers into formation. Glittery letters spelling out the group acronym are handed out, along with huge hearts on sticks. A banner is unfurled, and the group poses for photographs. Adela McDonalds job this year is to hold the G. She joined PFLAG about three years ago, when her daughter came out as a lesbian, and is now a committee member. McDonald is quick to clarify that she didnt seek out the group because she was struggling to accept her daughter. She used to work at the next desk to a founding member, and thought it sounded up her alley. In fact, when her daughter came out, McDonald said she had just two thoughts, both of them comparatively mild. One, she didnt want her daughter to be discriminated against; two, she might not be a grandmother. Fairly selfish, really, she says, on the latter. But not everyone in PFLAG joined the group in a show of support for their child. After Neil came out, Phipps used the group as support for herself reaching out to other parents of gay children to find out how they were handling it. I needed it, she says. We went to our first meeting where I listened and talked and drew a lot of support and strength. I also cried an awful lot, in the beginning. Slowly, the crying stopped. Neil says PFLAG helped his mum become his biggest supporter. It was everything, he says simply. And despite her qualms 20 years ago, Phipps wouldnt change a thing. I feel really privileged to have a gay son, because its just changed my life so entirely. As the PFLAG marchers make their way up the iconic parade route, they dont dance, just walk and wave. The group is sandwiched between Rainbow Babies and the Inner City Legal Centre, marching transgender kids and their parents. For the procession of family-oriented floats, the cheers from the crowd are enormous and emotions run high. In her first parade, McDonald was hit with the realisation that not all mothers react the supportive way she did. As we marched, someone in the crowd said to me I wish you were my mother, she says. That just got me. I thought, Ooh, thats sad. Its a common experience for the parents marching with PFLAG. For Phipps, memories of the first time she experienced it are almost too much to bear. As we were walking along, there was a lot of young people on the sides and they were weeping. And so was I. Her voice starts to crack. Theyd call out, I wish you were my mum, I wish you were my dad. View this image  Lane Sainty / BuzzFeed It took a while to get Phipps to that first parade. Her husband Keith, a former PFLAG president who passed away in 2007, marched first without his wife, who was still coming around to the exhibitionist Mardi Gras. But when Keith got home after the parade, he told her it was the most extraordinary natural high he had ever experienced. Phipps resolved to see it for herself the next year but worried about the very strange sights she might encounter. When we got into our formation, you wouldnt believe it. We were behind the NSW Gay Male Nudists Association, she says, laughing. They carried their genitalia in what looked to be a hairnet. There wasnt a decent body amongst them! Fourteen parades later, shes not bothered by anything. Back then, I said to Keith, Now Ive seen everything, she says. And Ive been fine ever since. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The statements he has made about LGBT issues are all over the place, said the president of the Log Cabin Republicans. youtube.com With Donald Trump racking up delegates needed to cinch the GOP presidential nomination, the countrys leading gay Republican group is pressing their partys frontrunner to untangle what it says are his conflicting positions on marriage equality. Where do you really stand on marriage equality, Mr. Trump? asks a video released Monday by the Log Cabin Republicans, which juxtaposes comments by Trump that are friendly to LGBT rights to his comments that appear hostile. On one hand, the one-minute web ad features Trump saying he respects the Supreme Courts 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which allowed same-sex couples to marry in all 50 states. The decisions been made, and that is the law of the land, Trump said in interview on MSNBCs Morning Joe. Trump is also seen telling a reporter that if hes elected, LGBT people could expect forward motion on equality. Those comments and others have led some to see Trump as LGBT-rights trailblazer among Republican candidates. But in the video, Trump is also seen on the Christian Broadcasting Network being asked if evangelical voters can trust him to oppose same-sex couples marriage rights. Trump replies, I think they can trust me on traditional marriage. Trump has also said that he backs traditional marriage. More pointedly although this is not included in the video Trump told Fox News in January that he would strongly consider appointing Supreme Court justices to reverse the Obergefell decision if elected. Gregory T. Angelo, president of the Log Cabin Republicans, told BuzzFeed News in an interview Monday, I dont know that we can take Mr. Trump on his word because the statements he has made about LGBT issues are all over the place. I think they are contradictory, Angelo continued. I dont understand how overturning the Supreme Courts marriage equality decision could be considered forward progress for LGBT rights. Last year, Angelo had cited Trumps gay-friendly comments to say Trump would be the most pro-gay candidate in the GOP field. He then asked the Trump campaign in November to clarify where he stands. But I have not heard back from them, Angelo said. I understand being out on the campaign trail can be hectic, but we are getting to the point where time is short, and if Mr. Trump does emerge as our partys nominee, I would like some assurance from his campaign or the man himself that the Log Cabin Republicans can trust him to do no harm to the progress we have already made in this country. Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, the other front runners in the GOP primaries, have both taken hardline positions against same-sex marriage. Mr. Trump is an outlier in that he is the Republican frontrunner for the nomination, said Angelo. He has attended a same-sex wedding and donated tens of thousands of dollars to gay charities what other Republican candidate for president has done that in the past? Asked if he thought that Hillary Clinton, a Democrat, would be better on LGBT rights, Angelo said, I cant answer that question until I recieve a response from the Trump campaign. The group also ran a web ad in January that said Clinton was wrong on gay rights when it mattered. Trumps campaign did not respond to questions from BuzzFeed News about his positions on same-sex marriage. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Beautiful, handsome, perfect. Allison Slattery Rachael Hellman Allison Slattery View this image  Chellise Michael Photography / Via chellisemichaelphotography.com Jess Caragliano, 34 Describe your everyday style:  Typically pretty laid-back I work in the music industry, so its completely acceptable for me to wear whatever I want at all times. I basically wear black denim jeans every day, often paired with Doc Martens and a vintage band tee. I have quite a collection of old Genesis shirts. Did you always know you would suit up for the big day?  Growing up, I would basically have a meltdown any time there was reason to dress up for any sort of special event or family gathering. It was always an awful, stressful experience, where I just didnt ever feel like myself. As a young teenager, I would occasionally get away with wearing combat boots with whatever dress my mom wanted me to wear but even that compromise still never felt quite right. Prior to being part of a queer community, I honestly just thought my only dress-up options included awkwardly wearing a dress or just being inappropriately underdressed. When my brother got married, I wore the bridesmaid dress that I was supposed to wear, and while I felt extremely uncomfortable, I didnt even think to ask them if I could wear a suit instead. Looking at his wedding photos, I barely recognized myself and felt embarrassed knowing that these pictures would live on in my family forever. That was probably a tipping point for me, and I knew I would wear suits moving forward especially on my wedding day. Tell us about finding the one, meaning your suit!  I didnt have a particular vision heading into it, but as soon as I saw the Noose & Monkey blue velvet suit jacket online, I impulsively bought it and hoped it would fit. I did the same thing when I spotted the zebra YSL creepers. Both of those items are distinctly bolder than my usual style, but for some reason I felt compelled to create my wedding look around them. The jacket was clearly too big on me, so I contacted Bindle & Keep, who have a great reputation for making custom suits for queer women, and asked if they would tailor the jacket for me. Luckily, they agreed to do it, despite not typically tailoring suits that arent made by them. Gender was a non-issue during the fitting, which was really refreshing. I definitely had a pre-wedding pang of insecurity that the blue velvet jacket and zebra shoes were a ridiculous combo, but my amazing wife reminded me to just trust my gut, be myself, and own the look. So thats what I did! chellisemichaelphotography.com chellisemichaelphotography.com If you could do it all again, would you change anything?  My bow tie was a bit crooked all night. How did your spouse feel about it?  She was completely supportive I think she probably would have been horrified if I didnt want to wear a suit! Plus, she wore an amazing custom gold lam jumpsuit, so clearly she doesnt feel confined by what is considered traditional wedding style. What would your advice be to anyone thinking about (and nervous about) donning dapper duds on their wedding day? Or even just to attend a wedding? There is already enough stress and pressure involved with planning and hosting a wedding; the last thing anyone needs is to feel uncomfortable in their own clothes. Wear whatever style is going to make you feel the most confident and the most like yourself, so you can project that positive energy among your friends and family. Plus, its important to remember that everyone in attendance loves you and just wants to see you happy, so there is no need to hide behind the clothes that you think people expect you to wear. As for attending someone elses wedding, the same spirit applies. Ive certainly had frustrating encounters at other peoples events where Ive been mistaken for a 13-year-old boy or where Ive been told I was in the wrong restroom a suit and short hair can really throw some people off! Fortunately, in those instances no one was being hostile or purposefully offensive, so I was able to roll with it and move forward maintaining my personal confidence. Ultimately, Ive found that its far better to just be true to yourself even if that means making a few people uncomfortable along the way. Sum up your emotions on the big day in three words? MY WIFES HOT! View this image  chellisemichaelphotography.com View this image  amygrayphoto.com Adraea, 30 How would you describe your everyday style?  Tomboy preppy, I guess. I like to be comfortable, but most of my clothes come from the mens section. Did you always know you would suit up for the big day?  I think so. Ive never seen myself in a dress for my wedding. I figured Id wear a ladies pants suit, but once we started planning, I decided I wanted the full dress-up. Tell us about finding the one, meaning the suit! The suit I wore was actually my replacement suit! As a plus-size woman, I have the hardest time finding clothes that fit the way I like, so I knew for a suit I would have to go a tailored route. My original planned wedding suit was tailored by Crown Tailor out of Bangkok, Thailand, who I found after months of research. (They came to New York, and I went out there to get fitted and pick out fabric.) The suit arrived and some things were off. Crown agreed to make the alterations quickly. So I sent the suit back priority mail, and my suit disappeared! No kidding; it disappeared. Even with the tracking, no one knew where it went. So, with about 16 days till my wedding, I jumped onto Sumissura, a womens made-to-measure company that had tailored a blazer for me previously. They were good working with me and allowed me to pick measurements and customizations that gave the clothes a menswear look for my body. So, the only emotionally stressful part was knowing that I couldnt just go to a store and find a suit to fit me once my original suit went missing. Overall, it worked out fine, and I would highly recommend either tailor. If you could do it all again, would you change anything?  For that day, not really. I wouldve adjusted a few of the measurements, but overall, I think it turned out great. My wife prefers the suit I wore to the wedding rather than my original one. I keep looking at other ideas for what Id like to wear when we renew our vows, but otherwise, I was really happy. How did your spouse feel about it?   She loved it! I think she just loves seeing me in a tie. What would your advice be to anyone thinking about (and nervous about) donning dapper duds on their wedding day? Or even just to attend a wedding? If thats what you feel comfortable in, do it! There were times when I was getting dressed that I was nervous to let my mother see me like that. She had never seen me in a tie before then. Bu, I knew that it was my wedding and I had to be true to myself, and Im very happy I did. Be you! You only get one life, and your wedding is your big day. And, if you want to wear it to someone elses wedding do it too! Everyone has the right to feel comfortable in his/her own style. Sum up your emotions on the big day in three words? This is me. View this image  Erica Camille / Via ericacamilleproductions.com Crys Fitzgerald-Moore, 35 Describe your everyday style:  Im probably somewhere between normcore, street, and the Patagonia type. My favorite outfit is a pair of all-white Jordan low-tops, really worn-in Levis, a black Uniqlo T-shirt, and a trucker hat embroidered with a wolf. I run and rock climb a lot, so Im more often than not still wearing the wolf hat, but the rest of me is decked out in either climber-approved denim (aka Uniqlo) or Outlier. Outlier is great. They make really fancy high-end sportswear for men that is totally street but is good for a run or day at the gym. Did you always know you suit up on your big day? Gender is a funny thing. Whenever someone asks me about a dress, or finds it interesting that I didnt wear a dress, Im just befuddled and kind of stumped as to what to say. I imagine the reaction of an average dude-bro if you asked him how he felt about wearing or not wearing a dress. Thats kinda how I feel about it. (I would also be about as attractive as the average dude in a dress). Its a confusing thing to wrap your brain around biologically, Im a woman and OK with that. Genderwise, however, Im totally dude-bro. Tell us about finding the one, meaning your suit!  I had my suit custom-made at Bindle and Keep. I knew that something off the shelf wasnt going to work for me. Like most genderqueer folks, my shape doesnt fit traditional mens or womens clothing. Me specifically, I have very broad shoulders, but I also got me some birthin hips. The folks at Bindle and Keep were awesome. It could have been the kind of experience that ended up not only awkward, but traumatic. Not once did they ever make me feel like I was a woman who wanted to wear a mens suit. They just were talented folks who knew their stuff and wanted to make the right suit for Crys. View this image  Erica Camille / Via ericacamilleproductions.com If you could do it all again, would you change anything? I would have gotten a better pocket square. Thats about it. I was pretty on point. How did your spouse feel about it?  Stacey died. What would your advice be to anyone who is thinking about (and nervous about) donning dapper duds on their wedding day? Or even just to attend a wedding? Weddings are a minefield of heteronormativity. Even with ours, weve had to deal with peoples assumptions. I guess Id say you dont owe anyone anything. The wedding will only last the briefest of moments, but what you remember and especially how you felt will stay with you. What people think of you, that day or any other day, will constantly change. What matters is how you feel about yourself. Thats what will stick with you. Looking fly will always trump the haters in the long run. Sum up your emotions on the big day in three words? Namu Dai Bosa. Its a sutra we chant at the monastery that to me, represents that every thing and every person is imbued with a deep, profound, and inalienable beauty. Its a form of gratitude, I suppose. Erica Camille Erica Camille View this image  Allison Slattery / Via alisonslatteryphotography.blogspot.com Lindsay, 30 Describe your everyday style:  Extreme casual. T-shirts or button-ups and jeans or chinos. I will wear the same T-shirt until my wife declares Ive overdone it. Colorful socks are awesome as well. Did you always know you would suit up for the big day?  I cant say getting married was something I ever thought about before falling in love with my wife, but once I did, wearing a dress never ever crossed my mind. Its just not my thing. Tell us about finding the one, meaning your suit: I got the suit custom-tailored in Montreal because I am too small to fit into most mens formalwear. Unfortunately, it was a fairly frustrating experience. The tailor herself was cool about what I wanted, but when she sent the suit off to be pieced together, it was returned with an entirely different style. She claimed the older man that does this for her saw a female name and decided the cut was too masculine and didnt make sense. This led to a huge delay in receiving the suit. I only got it the morning of my wedding after an entire day of silence from the tailor because her phone had died. If you could do it all again, would you change anything?  I would have taken the time to find someone who has worked with queer people and asked for a few references or pictures. This is, of course, tough to find, even in bigger cities sometimes. How did your spouse feel about it?  She loved itbut shed say I looked amazing even if I was wearing mom jeans, so who knows. What would your advice be to anyone thinking about (and nervous about) donning dapper duds on their wedding day? Or even just to attend a wedding? Go for it! When you feel good, you look good. People always look the best when they are comfortable and confident. Sum up your emotions on the big day in three words? So much fun! View this image  alisonslatteryphotography.blogspot.com View this image  Allison Slattery Photography Larae Harbour, 25  Describe your everyday style:  My style is mostly like Jay Z with a splash of Michael Bubl. First and foremost its the shoes usually sneakers and then I add a nice button-up and go from there. Its important for me to have a mix of comfort and style that allows me to go from day to evening wear with ease. Did you always know you would suit up for the big day?  Yep. I have never felt like Larae in a dress. Dresses just dont suit the image I have of myself. Tell us about finding the one, meaning your suit!  I had seen a navy suit I loved in a shop near my house, but it didnt fit me. A few days later I was in the mall looking for a blue suit, and came across a small suit store and walked in. To my surprise, the shopkeeper, an old white man, was super sweet and helpful and actually suggested this suit for me because of the fit and color. He had bought it for himself, but it didnt fit right. He was so excited when I fell in love with it. I was excited too! I had to get it only slightly altered to fit perfectly. Once I had the suit, I was ready to get my Jay Z on and use accessories to take it to the next level. Allison Slattery Photography Allison Slattery Photography If you could do it all again, would you change anything?  Nope, I loved everything about my outfit! Still trying to figure out how I can wear it again. And again. And again. How did your spouse feel about it?  Kellys words: You looked banging! She thought that I looked so happy and confident and sexy in what I was wearing, which was very true. She loved the outfit from head to toe because it reflected me. What would your advice be to anyone thinking about (and nervous about) donning dapper duds on their wedding day? Or even just to attend a wedding? If you think youll feel more comfortable in a suit than a dress, then most likely you will! If you choose to be authentic to yourself I think it also provides your guests the space to explore what truly feels authentic to them. If youre worried about style or fit, trust that there are many options and people that can help you with tailoring for the right fit. I truly feel when you love what you are wearing itll make you smile brighter, laugh harder, and feel truly beautifully handsome on your big day. Sum up your emotions on the big day in three words? Oh, hot damn. Allison Slattery Photography View this image  paigenelsonphotography.com / Via handhweddings.com Rachael Heller, 25  Describe your everyday style: Book nerd meets tousled teenager meets grandpa. Im usually wearing Clarks or wingtips, and most of my shirts have collars. I have a couple tattoos and piercings. I like my shirts tucked in and my hair slicked back. My hair does not always behave. Did you always know you would suit up for the big day?  Well, I didnt always know Id get married. But my mom does tell stories about how, around the age of 3 or 4, I started refusing to wear dresses. So yes, I think it was a given that if a wedding occurred, a suit would be involved. How did you find the one, and I mean the suit!  I had my suit custom-made at Kipper Clothiers in San Francisco. It was my first suit and my first custom-clothing experience. As a female with the corresponding female body, I was a bit nervous going into the experience as to how my suit would fit and look. And after designing it, getting my measurements taken, and waiting for it to be made, it didnt fit right immediately. And that made me even more nervous (even though I went in knowing that is part of the process). But as promised, the team at Kipper journeyed downtown to their tailor with me to make sure it all worked out well. It ended up fitting perfectly, and Im really happy with how it turned out. And its now one of my not-so-secret dreams to one day have a wardrobe made up of solely bespoke suits. A queer girl can dream, right? If you could do it all again, would you change anything?  I had a hard time deciding between a jacket that matched the pants, or a jacket with a bit more character plaid, perhaps. I still think that could have been fun, but looking back at the pictures, I cant say that Im unhappy with how my suit turned out. And it gives me an excuse to get another jacket made. How did your spouse feel about it?  We surprised each other with our clothes, so she didnt see it until the day of our wedding. Im happy to say that she loved it. In fact, our wedding took place on a typically cold San Francisco summers day, and my wife, Sam (who was wearing a beautiful, but sleeveless dress), ended up wearing my suit jacket more than I did. She also especially liked that I had our initials and the date of our wedding embroidered on the inside lining. paigenelsonphotography.com Paige Nelson Photography What would your advice be to anyone who is thinking about (and nervous about) donning dapper duds on their wedding day? Or even to attend a wedding.   Do it! For me, I always think that I look the best when I feel the most comfortable. And that means donning dapper duds for sure. I realize that I am lucky to have had this experience where I did, to have access to a place like Kipper (run by queer people and open to anyone), and that Im supported by my friends and family and have confidence in how I like to dress. I know that there are places that arent filled with such a large majority of bighearted, open-minded, love-filled humans. With that being said, if you feel safe enough to do go dapper and have the hankering to do so, do it. People might surprise you. You might surprise you. Everyone is impressed by a lady in a suit. Sum up your emotions on the big day in three words? Happy. Grateful. Dashing. View this image  thekitcheners.co.uk Karlyn, 27  How would you describe your everyday style?  A visual of my personality. I do not wear what I am not. I steer toward confidence and comfort. Earth tones are my favorite. If there is a fedora or newspaper cap involved, then Im set. Did you always know you would, er, kilt up for the big day? I did. I didnt want to be in a mens suit or the typical womens suit. In my case, it was a kilt that I chose because of the location of our wedding Scotland. Before knowing I would wear a kilt, it was difficult to find suits that were already tailored for a womans body with a dapper flare. I was nearly going to have to find a designer to create a custom suit. thekitcheners.co.uk thekitcheners.co.uk How did you go about finding the one, meaning your kilt? My kilt was made in Scotland. They did not have a womans kilt that fit the style I wanted, so I took my measurements as they described on their website and sent an email to let them know it would be for a woman. I had to verify that the measurements made sense for a female while still keeping the male kilt style. Their sizes did not go down to my measurements, so I knew I would have to get it tailored to my form. Emotionally, I worried they would not be receptive to an American female wanting to wear a kilt; my focus was on the cultural position of thinking. They were very receptive and made it a very simple process while assuring me it would be completely appropriate. If you could do it all again, would you change anything?  None, I loved it all! How did your spouse feel about it?  She encouraged me to wear what would make me feel most comfortable and like me what I wanted to say my vows in and the official I do. She knew what it looked like off, but seeing her face for the first time with us both dressed in our wedding outfits will be forever engraved in a beautiful memory. What would your advice be to anyone who is thinking about (and nervous about) donning dapper duds on their wedding day? Or even to attend a wedding.   Be yourself. I learned this early on in life. If I had to put a label on it, I love a more tailored, masculine feel. Im not trying to be someone I am not, or a gender that I am not. It is who I am and most confident/comfortable wearing. I want what I want. If I project that, then what is there to feel nervous about? Sum up your emotions on the big day in three words? Magically in love. View this image  thekitcheners.co.uk View this image  amberwilkie.com / Via Amber Wilkie Photography Melissa Martz, 31  Describe your everyday style:  Nonchalant, I suppose. My fashion icon is unabashedly Ellen DeGeneres: the pants, the vests, the shirts, the blazers, the shoes, I really love it all. Stylish and impeccably comfortable. I have a hard time finding such items to fit me because I have a slim frame, but I recognize and greatly appreciate a classy wardrobe. I often find shopping for clothes that match my aesthetic and build quite difficult. Did you always know you would suit up for your big day?  I hadnt thought about it much as an adult prior to getting engaged, but growing up, my dream was to wear a dark, vivid purple wedding dress complete with a red velvet heart in the center. I remember my mom trying to talk me out of it, but I was convinced it would look fabulous. Since then, after asking my wife to marry me, I was nearly 100% confident that I would pass on a dress. I think wedding dresses are beautiful, but ultimately decided it didnt suit me, pardon the pun. Tell us about finding the one, meaning your suit!  I researched bespoke tailors in the D.C. area online, looking for one that had experience making clothes for womens bodies. I found one in McLean, Virigina Sofios and sent an email to their office explaining that I wanted a three-piece pantsuit and button-down shirt for my wedding (and that I was a lady) and could they help me. Their office staff set up a brainstorming session for me with the master tailor. I was very anxious about how my request would be received, halfway expecting Sorry not sorry, little girl, thats beyond my abilities. Luckily Sofio was amazing and he grasped exactly what I was clumsily describing: fitted but not too fitted; none of that butterfly, flared look to the jacket that most womens suit jackets have; functional pockets in the pants for Chapstick, in the vest for my pocket watch that my wife had gotten me for our first Christmas together, and interior jacket pockets for who knows what (you can never have too many pockets). I wanted something masculine with a feminine aura, or possibly the other way around. For me the experience was a complete relief. I had worried so much about being judged or not taken seriously or misunderstood, and instead his eyes lit up with excitement as I described what I wanted and he captured it perfectly, intent on creating something edgy yet tasteful and charming. amberwilkie.com amberwilkie.com If you could do it all again, would you change anything?  I might have gotten it a little more fitted. I was so concerned about it not being too tight that I think I exaggerated how loose-fitting I wanted it by a touch. It fit gorgeously regardless. How did your spouse feel about it?  Surprised! I had said I was going to wear jeans and a vest with a button-down shirt and a tie, and had arranged for the suit in secrecy with my best woman. So she had no idea I was going to be in a suit, much less one tailored from scratch. Her face, when she walked into the chapel and saw me, was adorably perplexed for a few moments. Almost like she didnt recognize me. Once she got down the aisle she was like, What When HowYou look amazing. I really felt stunning, something I hadnt felt previously. What would your advice be to anyone who is thinking about (and nervous about) donning dapper duds on their wedding day? Or even to attend a wedding.   For bespoke suits, research multiple places and make sure youre comfortable with the tailor. My first visit didnt cost me anything it was merely a meeting of the minds. Thankfully it worked out for me, but I could have walked away if Sofio and Gigi werent as awesome as they were. I wasnt able to find something off the rack that had all the visual and functional elements I wanted that actually fit me; other people might have an easier time finding something less labor-intensive, which Im sure is a great option. Either way, being comfortable and feeling dapper while doing so is whats most important, to me at least. I had a friend in college who used to say, Dress well, test well, and he would wear a suit and tie to take every exam. I never took him up on that advice then, but with my wedding suit, I discovered the confidence and strength you gain from dressing like a champ. If only all my clothes could be so lovely. Sum up your emotions on the big day in three words? Would buy again.

Did you always know you would suit up for your big day? Yeah, wearing a dress is never an option for me for any occasion. Tell us about finding the one, meaning the suit! The suit Im wearing in these photos is actually different than what I wore to my actual wedding. My wife and I eloped to Hawaii, so it was a crazy scramble to get our outfits for the ceremony. I ended up putting together a sweet ensemble made up of a white blazer from Zara, a patterned white-and-blue button-up shirt from Topman, white Levis 511s, and all-white classic high-top Vans. It was crazy trying to get all of that together in such a short amount of time. My wife proposed to me on Christmas Eve and we got married on New Years Eve. Do you know how hard it is to find a white blazer in the middle of winter? Even in L.A., that shit is not in season. It was literally like a wedding scavenger hunt, so that part was a little stressful, but admittedly kind of fun. If you could do it all again, would you change anything?  If we end up having a proper ceremony with all of our family and friends, it would be cool to get a suit custom-made. Styled by holiday-celebrate.com amygrayphoto.com How did your spouse feel about it?  She thought I looked very handsome and couldnt keep her hands off of me. Id say thats a pretty good sign that I did OK. What would your advice be to anyone who is thinking about (and nervous about) donning dapper duds on their wedding day? Or even to attend a wedding? Look, your wedding is for you and your spouse, and if youre going to feel your happiest, proudest, and hottest in a suit, then fucking go for it. If anyone is going to give you a hard time about that, then you should not be inviting them to your wedding. Period. If you get invited to a wedding, and youre nervous about wearing a suit, just remember that your friend who is getting married is going to be too overwhelmed to care about what youre wearing; they just want you to show up in something nice. If they have close-minded family that has a problem with you, just pour yourself some extra champagne and be thankful that theyre not your family. Sum up your big day in three words? We killed it.

aS"*SOUND THE PLEBISCITE ALARM* View this image  Richard Bouhet / AFP / Getty Images View this image  Saeed Khan / AFP / Getty Images The bill to constitute the plebiscite will be introduced early in the life of the new parliament so that we can have the plebiscite before the end of this year, he said. In the event there were to be a Yes vote, the government would legislate to give effect to the wishes of the people. This means Australians in same-sex relationships could have the right to marry by 2017. However, the proposed plebiscite has been roundly criticised by Labor, the Greens and marriage equality advocacy groups, who warn it will be an ugly and divisive debate that harms LGBTI Australians. I think it would be perfectly understandable that a member of parliament representing a conservative electorate and with conservative views themselves might choose to vote no, he said. However, Brandis added: There is virtually no doubt at all that if the public votes yes that the parliament would follow.  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Lawmakers pledged to begin work after the countrys historically moderate Islamic organization declared that LGBT activities should be prohibited and categorized as crimes. Rin Hindryati reports from Jakarta and BuzzFeed News Lester Feder from Washington. View this image  Pro-LGBT activists protest on February 23, 2016 in Yogyakarta, Indonesia Ulet Ifansasti / Getty Images Indonesian lawmakers are in discussions to draft legislation to restrict LGBT rights, according to several members of the countrys legislature who spoke to BuzzFeed News this week. LGBT content on the internet is the chief concern of these lawmakers, and on Saturday, the Jakarta Post reported that the governments communications ministry would begin work on its own proposal to reign in online content in response. Deding Ishak, a member of the National Assembly from the Golkar Party (the legislatures second-largest bloc) and deputy chairman of the assemblys committee on religious and cultural affairs, said in an interview in Jakarta that hed like to see legislation that aims to prevent and protect society from the massive propaganda launched by the LGBT community. Their campaign has reached out on social media, he said. We need a solution to deal with this situation it is like a warning to us all. This is the latest escalation in a political uproar over LGBT rights that began in January and caught LGBT activists by surprise. While there have been isolated confrontations over LGBT issues in Indonesia, it is unusual for the issue to be the focus of prolonged political debate in the country, which has a reputation for pluralism. But following remarks by the higher education minister in January, some of the countrys top politicians have been drawn into the debate: Defense Minister Ryamizard Ryacudu recently suggested the LGBT movement was a bigger threat to national security than nuclear weapons; a former communications minister called for punishing homosexuality with execution on Twitter. There have also been reports of a growing number of hate crimes targeting people perceived as LGBT in the country. The biggest shift in the politics of the issue, however, was a call last week from the Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) movement for the government to crackdown on LGBT rights. The NU claims tens of millions of members and is described as the worlds largest Muslim organization, but was founded in large part to counter fundamentalist movements coming out of the Middle East and has not previously taken the kind of anti-LGBT stance held by more conservative Indonesian Islamic groups. The group issued a statement declaring that homosexuality was incompatible with human nature and asking the government to force rehabilitation for every person who has LGBT characteristics so they can return to normal, according to a report in the Jakarta Post. Based on NUs evaluation, LGBT activities should be prohibited and categorized as crimes, the Post quoted the groups leader as saying. The call for legislation was most strongly taken up by the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), a conservative Islamist party that has a small number of seats in the National Assembly. We will draft a proposal that would cover all aspects from upstream to downstream, said Junaidi Auly, a PKS assemblyman who is a member of the committee handling finance and development. It is no longer just a matter of personal behavior their propaganda has become incessant. Auly also raised concerned about support for LGBT rights work by the United Nations Development Program, which the countrys vice-president demanded be ended last month. I believe [LGBT people] can be cured, even those who have this since they were born, Auly said. But if it is a movement asking people to join or even intimidating and framing people to join the community, we could criminalize their actions. The countrys communication ministry has already taken steps to censor LGBT content, including a demand the messaging apps Line and Whatsapp remove LGBT-themed emojis. It announced that it would block Tumblr for gay and pornographic content, though it immediately backpedalled, perhaps because the announcement came just as Indonesian President Joko Widodo was on a visit to Silicon Valley. It also announced guidelines barring broadcasters from showing men wearing feminine dress or displaying or speaking in a feminine manner. The crackdown on LGBT content online coincides with broader regulations affecting social media, which has rapidly become a major market for companies such as Facebook and Twitter in the past few years as internet access has expanded in the country. This includes threatening to block companies if they do not incorporate in the country so they can be taxed and regulated. View this image  An Indonesian woman helps a drag queen prepare for a a cabaret show in Yogyakarta, Indonesia Ulet Ifansasti / Getty Images Despite the outcry, even lawmakers with strong ties to Muslim organizations are not united in the need for new legislation, and some who support the concept of the bill say it will probably not be enacted quickly. I dont think we will end up adopting the anti-LGBT law I dont think it will be possible, said Arvin Hakim Toha, a member of the NU-backed National Awakening Party who sits on the defense and foreign affairs committee. The government already has taken steps under current law to reign in the LGBT movement, he said, so new legislation isnt necessary. I dont think it is big problem yes, there is a movement funded by foreign funds but it has been banned, so what else is needed? he said. There is no need to regulate LGBT issues. The growth of social media may be one force fueling the blow-up over LGBT rights, which has both given greater visibility to LGBT people and provided a megaphone for anti-LGBT voices. Social media has also challenged the historical ruling interests grip on the media, said Human Rights Watchs Andreas Harsono, and forces that want to curtail online expression for political reasons are able to piggyback on powerful religious groups calls for an anti-LGBT crackdown for their own reasons. The Islamists, they really would like to control the internet because of the sexuality issue, Harsono said. But the oligarchy would really like to control the internet because its the gadfly picking at their interests. The internet has been transformative for LGBT groups, added Yuli Rustinawati, chair of the LGBT group Arus Pelangi. Before three or four years ago, they only way LGBT people could give support to one another or organize was through face-to-face meetings. But the past few years have created a space where we can express ourselves through social media. This backlash may have happened, she said, in part because LGBT people online can be proud of themselves, coming out [without risking] showing their faces this is like a safe space for us. The reaction to this online and, now, among lawmakers also means now we can see clearly who is our friend and who is our enemy, she said. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Australia is the only country in the world that requires transgender teenagers to apply to the Family Court for hormone treatment. Experts say it has to stop. CANBERRA, ACT When Jeremy Loiterton was 16, he sent his mum an email no parent wants to receive. It said, simply, Help. At the beginning of that year, Jeremy had come out as transgender. Being able to live openly and shed a secret he had kept since his early teens was liberating. Four months into being out as Jeremy, I knew it was right, he tells BuzzFeed News. I had never felt more happy in my entire life. But despite his elation at being out, Jeremy was still stuck in a body he hated. He started to feel deeply disconnected from the friends and teachers around him, and struggled with depression. He started failing school. His anxiety was so bad, he could only talk to his mum about being transgender via email. Help, he wrote to her. I cant be at school anymore. Jeremy dropped out at the end of the year, trying to finish via distance education but eventually giving up altogether. He needed medical treatment, badly. But to start taking cross-sex hormones in this case testosterone as a minor, he had to apply to the Family Court. It wasnt an option for Jeremy. His father was absent, and he needed consent from both his parents. He just had to wait. From age 12 to 18, six years, I went without medication for a medical malady, he says. It was absolutely awful. Access to medical treatment changes transgender peoples lives. It can mean the difference between employment and homelessness, education and dropping out, wellbeing and depression, anxiety and suicide. But for many, it remains out of reach. Australia is the only Western country where transgender people under the age of 18 must seek court permission to start taking cross-sex hormones. At best, experts say, the delay causes emotional trauma and financial stress. At worst, its a matter of life and death. Now 18, Jeremy is sitting with BuzzFeed News outside a Canberra caf, under an umbrella that is blocking out the sun but not the heat. Hes dressed handsomely in a purple button-up and black pants, with a wave of blonde hair swept across the top of his head and striking symmetrical lip piercings. Jeremy is looking for work after dropping out of school last year. Ideally, he says, hed like to score a gig as an apprentice baker. I do cake decorating, he adds with a smile. Hes been on testosterone for 11 months and is doing well. But recalling the years prior, he says the only thing that kept him alive was the constant reassurance of Michelle Telfer, a paediatrician in the Gender Service at the Royal Childrens Hospital in Melbourne. If it wasnt for her being so reassuring at every step, telling me there is a light at the end of the tunnel there would be no Jeremy, he says matter-of-factly. She has saved the lives of countless children. I dont know if anyone has ever told her that. View this image  Sean Davey for BuzzFeed The unassuming Telfer is at the centre of so many transgender childrens stories, but reacts with surprise You want a picture of me? when BuzzFeed News asks her to pose. Telfer is Australias most experienced paediatrician when it comes to transgender adolescents. She heads up a staff of 16 at the Melbourne Royal Childrens Hospital Gender Service, and has been responsible for developing the program the largest in Australia over the past four years. In operation since 2003, the state-funded service diagnoses and educates transgender children and their families. Much of its work involves guiding transgender adolescents through the nightmare that is puberty. It is the most incredibly distressing period of their life, Telfer says, because many of the changes of puberty are irreversible once you develop breasts, you cant get rid of them unless you have surgery to remove them. Once your voice breaks, you cant do anything to alter the deepening of your voice. In other words, the stakes are high. Puberty, high school; its like walking a tightrope for trans kids. Its in this crucial period that some children begin to self-harm, or worse, attempt suicide. Many young people say if I cant live as who I am, Id rather be dead, Telfer says. We hear that frequently. Its no wonder Jo Hirst is worried. Hirst, the mother of a transgender son she has asked not to be named, is a central figure in the small, strong community of parents supporting their transgender kids. Her warmth and generosity is immediately evident, but underpinning it is a quiet ferociousness. Hirst is furious about the challenges facing her 7-year-old. Someone is going to die soon if something doesnt change, she tells BuzzFeed News. A 2010 study from LaTrobe University found that 50% of transgender adolescents will self-harm, while 28% will attempt suicide. In a private Facebook group for parents of gender-diverse children, these statistics are brought to life on a regular basis. There are posts all the time when parents whose children cant access hormones easily become suicidal and end up in mental health units, Hirst says. It is so distressing and so terrifying to see one of those posts. Theyre not rare. Hirst thinks the world of Jeremy, who acts as a role model to her young son. However, she fears for children who are going through what he did. Not all of them can hang on, like Jeremy, until they are 18. He has amazing strength, and an amazing mum. Not all of them can do that. As acceptance and understanding of transgender people continues to grow, they are coming out younger and younger. The Gender Service at the Royal Childrens Hospital in Melbourne started with one referral in 2003. Last year, it received 170, up from 104 in 2014, 60 in 2013, and 18 in 2012. Upon presenting at the Gender Service, children are assessed by a specialist team including clinical psychologists, child adolescent psychiatrists, paediatricians, and fertility experts. The process is very thorough, says Telfer, in response to public concern that growing acceptance of transgender people will see kids transitioning willy-nilly. This arduous diagnostic phase varies depending on the age of the child. The clinic sees children aged from 3 to 18. The younger they are, the less urgent the diagnosis. If we saw a 3-year-old, for instance, there would be no need to give a diagnosis for many years, Telfer says. We would wait, watch, support, educate. For kids about to start or who have just started puberty, the process doesnt skip any steps. But they are often moved up the year-long waiting list so they can get the treatment they need as soon as possible. For prepubescent children, treatment can be as simple as gender affirmation. A young trans girl might grow out her hair, wear dresses and skirts, adopt a new girls name.Once puberty hits, treatment can be divided into two stages. The first: puberty blockers. This medication, which can be prescribed by a doctor, suspends the development of secondary sex characteristics while allowing for cognitive and social growth. Blockers are reversible if a child stops taking them, their body will go straight back to getting on with puberty. The second is cross-sex hormones. This is the part that can only take place after court approval, and typically involves a transgender boy like Jeremy starting to take testosterone, or a transgender girl starting to take oestrogen, around the age of 15 or 16. European studies show exceptional outcomes for young transgender adults who accessed these stages of treatment as kids, says Telfer. We see improved mental health outcomes, we see quality of life thats the same as the general population, we see rates of higher education completion above average levels, and we see the same vocational outcomes as the general population, she says. View this image  Sean Davey for BuzzFeed Talk of developing breasts is enough to make the average kid blush, but 10-year-old Evie is just mad that she has to go to court for the privilege. A lot of kids in my class are going through puberty, she tells BuzzFeed News, in between slurps of a big strawberry milkshake. Its basically two girls, me and a friend, were the only ones with a flat chest. The rest are all having everything happen. As the middle child of five, Evie is well-trained in a bargaining tactic any parent of multiple children will recognise. Do you see my brothers and sisters going to court so they can go through puberty? she asks. No. So why do I have to? But like a lot of questions kids ask, the answer is complicated. Fiona Kelly is an associate professor of law at LaTrobe University. Shes written extensively on the legal quagmire transgender kids and their families face when they embark on the Family Court process. And shes often tasked with explaining the precedent in simple terms. In brief, in 2004 a 13-year-old named Alex wanted to access puberty blockers. As Alex was a ward of the state, the Department of Human Services worried they did not have the power to consent to treatment on his behalf. So they sought permission from the Family Court. Faced with making a decision, Justice Nicholson looked for precedent and homed in on a 1992 decision from the High Court known now as Marions Case. It was about an intellectually disabled girl whose parents had sought permission from the court to have a hysterectomy performed on their daughter, which would effectively sterilise her. In deciding the case, the court stated that parental or guardian consent could not be given for procedures that are invasive and irreversible and are not in direct response to a physical, rather than psychiatric, medical issue. A court had to weigh in. In using this as a guide for Alexs case, the Family Court in Australia created a precedent for special medical treatment that put gender dysphoria treatment in the same category as sterilisation. Theres some distinct differences between the two cases, says Fiona Kelly. The issue is whether there is any risk of the child and the parent having conflicting interests. In gender dysphoria, I cant see what the risk would be, in giving the parent the opportunity to consent. I cant imagine a situation where a parent is imposing this on a child. A significant break came in 2013 when an appeal decision removed permission for kids to use blockers from the Family Courts jurisdiction. However, the restriction on cross-sex hormones endures. And that is why Evie has to ask the court for permission to go through puberty as a young woman. At the juncture of this medical and legal imbroglio is a simple fact: Kids are forced into a chronically clogged court system. They are caught between a bad option and a worse one: a costly and anxiety-inducing legal process, or living with a body that doesnt match their identity. In her research, Kelly has found the average time between filing an application and a decision being handed down to be 812 months a delay that takes an enormous emotional toll. It came through strongly in the interviews that the childs mental health deteriorated rapidly as the process went on, she says. A lot of them are fearful the idea of court being this adversarial scary formal process is really overwhelming. Kelly also points out that since these hearings started in 2004, not a single child has been denied cross-sex hormone treatment. The current court process is a very harmful, lengthy, and expensive rubber stamp, she says. Increasingly, the Family Court agrees. Last year, Justice Victoria Bennett argued treatment for gender dysphoria should never have been made a special medical treatment in the first place. Justice Steven Strickland believes a High Court appeal to overturn the precedent is unlikely given the trend towards these applications being granted, and so has opined that advocates should focus on lobbying Canberra for a small change to the Family Law Act to end the courts involvement in cross-sex hormone therapy. So on 22 February, a group of transgender children and their parents travelled to Canberra to meet with MPs. Their goal: get support for that small legislative change. 12-year-old Isabelle with her mum Naomi at Parliament House. Sean Davey for BuzzFeed 15-year-old Georgie embraces her twin brother at Parliament, with mum Rebekah watching on. Sean Davey for BuzzFeed At an event hosted by Greens senator Janet Rice, about 15 transgender children, with their siblings and parents, filled a Parliament House meeting room. They were joined by various federal MPs, including Liberal Warren Entsch, Labors Graham Perrett, and independents Andrew Wilkie and Cathy McGowan. Evie and Meagan occupied a seat at the table in the middle of room, tiny Evie sitting on her mothers lap in a dress and silver ballet flats. Jeremy sat against the wall flanked by a generous spread of cakes, tea, and juice. Other kids donned rainbow T-shirts. One brought a sign, painted in the colours of the transgender flag, that read, My people need our rights. As the room heard anecdotes peppered with anguish and frustration from a panel of children, parents, and experts, some people fought back tears. View this image  Sean Davey for BuzzFeed Greens senator Janet Rice says she was very pleased with the level of support shown for these kids. The proposed reform has cross-party support within the Parliamentary Friends of LGBTI Australians group, co-chaired by Rice, Entsch, and Perrett. The legislative change isnt vastly complicated, Rice says. If we have [wider] cross-party support, it should be able to get through the parliament smoothly. She says: I am hopeful that within the year it should be possible, but then adds: Maybe Im being overly optimistic. Right now, the potential for reform lies in the hands of attorney general George Brandis. A statement provided by his office to BuzzFeed News said: The Government is sensitive to the concerns of children and their families who are living with gender dysphoria and is actively considering options for reform. There is no indication of a timeline. Rice says she will keep checking in. Its hard to parent a transgender kid; to watch them wrangle with issues that adults find thorny and complex. And even the most supportive of parents remember a time when they werent fully on their childs side. Evie recalls walking like a girl before she had come out: Before I transitioned, I just walked casually and Mum would go, Walk like a boy! Her mum, Meagan Macdonald, winces. My husband and I, we just werent there, she offers apologetically. Like a lot of parents, the Macdonalds had no experience with what it meant to be transgender. It came down to Evie screaming at me, saying, Why cant you just accept me for who I am? Macdonald says. I walked away going, Why the hell cant I? Its me who has to change.  View this image  Sean Davey for BuzzFeed Evies family is prepared to go through the court process if thats what it comes to but they would prefer to avoid it. The emotional toll aside, there are practical concerns: the average cost of the process ranges from $10,000 to $30,000 (AUD). With five kids to feed, clothe, and put through school, the Macdonalds dont have that kind of money just lying around. We would have to remortgage our home to do the court process, which we will do if we have to, Macdonald tells BuzzFeed News. But at the end of the day, theres so many families who arent even in that position. Youve got single parents, renters. Where do they get the money? Sean Davey for BuzzFeed Sean Davey for BuzzFeed Evie is part of a new generation of transgender kids who have a real chance of never having to go through the pain Jeremy experienced in the years he waited for much-needed medical treatment. But its a chance that will be inaccessible to many, unless the court process is abolished. Jeremy easily ticks off the ways his life would have been different if only he got the treatment he needed earlier. Thered be no severe depression, no anxiety about trying to leave the house and be seen as male, he says. If Id started hormones at 16, Id be three years ahead of myself. It would have been a little bit later than everyone else, but by 18 I would have looked and sounded like a regular 18-year-old guy. It would make sense for him to be envious of kids like Evie. But, he says, it just makes him happy to see the new generation grow up. Im proud that I know them, he says slowly. I feel proud in the sense that Im surrounded by families who love their children, just like my mum loves me. And my dad now, were best friends again. The natural response would be jealousy.

aS"What happens when your same-sex partner controls, beats, or abuses you? BuzzFeed News spoke to survivors and the only national charity trying to help others like them. View this image  Rebecca Hendin Sam was three months pregnant when her girlfriend Lynn raped her. They were at home. Sensing that Lynn wanted sex, Sam decided to tell her that she did not. She suddenly got nasty, says Sam, flatly. She was physically a lot bigger than me. She pinned me against a doorway and said, Ill have what I fucking like if I fucking want it. She assaulted me. Sam is in her early thirties. It is only in the last few months she has felt able to talk about the events of her early twenties. She looks up briefly, as we sit talking in a half-empty restaurant, and asks, How do you say to your friends, My girlfriend rapes me when their only mental definition of rape is a man forcing his penis inside a womans vagina? How do you say you were assaulted when it comes back to the idea of that doesnt count? Well, it does count. Their relationship did not begin like this. The story of how it blackened into abuse emerges over an afternoon a patchwork account told in anecdotes, as if the whole tale from start to finish is too much to convey in one go. It is a story that not only Sam finds difficult to tell, but one that many lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people struggle to disclose. BuzzFeed News spoke to both LGBT survivors of domestic abuse and an organisation trying to help them amid a backdrop of cuts to funding. As the accounts of violence, rape, bullying, coercion, and control surfaced, sometimes for the first time, two questions began to form: What prevents LGBT people in particular from speaking out? And, what external forces are stopping them from finding safety? For Jo Harvey Barringer, CEO of Broken Rainbow, the only national LGBT domestic abuse charity, coming out is a key issue. How, she said, do you tell anyone you are living in fear from your partner if no one knows youre gay? As Mark, who wasnt out during his abuse, told BuzzFeed News: I had nobody to talk to, so I thought maybe this is what Ive got to put up with. It wasnt long before he was hospitalised. About 85% of callers to our helpline have a partner that will use the threat of outing them to colleagues, family or kids as a form of control, said Harvey Barringer. They received 10,000 calls last year. She described the 85% figure as just the starting point for what they do. The wider picture how the police react, how crimes go unrecorded, how hospitals, social services, and housing officers respond only compounds the danger facing victims. Harvey Barringer revealed something else: If the charity doesnt find 20,000 in the next few weeks, it could close. This, said Sam, would put lives at risk. View this image  Rebecca Hendin Sam recalls another incident, this time from near the end of her time with Lynn, when she tried to seek help. I went on the Womens Refuge website and its all about, If he does If he It uses male terminology so its an instant barrier. You go on that website in the middle of the night when shes in the loo, youre under your duvet on your mobile, and it hits you in the face: This doesnt happen to you, this is a heterosexual thing: If hes doing this And so you turn it off. And thats what I did. A few weeks later, Lynn tied Sam up. It was for a bit of fun, says Sam, darkly quoting Lynn. She then produced what she told me was a knife and held it to my throat. On that occasion, Sam managed to get away. It wouldnt be long, however, before everything escalated into the final incident, one Sam says is so specific and extreme she does not feel she can talk about it without identifying those involved. The police were called, but it did not lead to a conviction, and years later, she remains afraid. In the beginning, she says, Lynn wooed her, lavishing her with attention: endless messages and emails, even poetry. I was grateful that someone was interested in me, she says. At the time, Lynn seemed to her wonderful, exciting, but I remember always being slightly afraid of her. Sam thinks for a moment, trying to describe her ex-girlfriend carefully. Shes very intimidating, bolshie, physically intimidating, a very intense character, but mysterious talks in riddles. As a result, even at the start, Sam says she had doubts: I thought I cant possibly get involved in anything being pregnant, but people win you over. She took an interest and I responded to that. After Sam became pregnant, she grew isolated from her friends either, she says, because they were busy going out clubbing, or because some deemed her not a real lesbian because of the pregnancy. They did not know that Sam had previously, briefly, worked as a prostitute to try and survive financially. But Lynn knew. She used that as a stick to beat me with, calling me a slut and a whore, says Sam. After the early charm offensive, verbal abuse, along with increasingly controlling behaviour, began to emerge. View this image  Rebecca Hendin There was so much about the relationships that wasnt normal, says Sam, before explaining how. She gave me a contract a sexual contract: Tick these boxes if youd let me do If youd consider If youve ever done It was like a horrible version of 50 Shades of Grey. I didnt sign it. Regardless, she says, Lynn pushed her into doing things she did not want to. Later in the conversation, Sam says something in passing so quickly that it is only when the recording of the interview is replayed that the words resonate properly: She stuck needles in me. Sam couldnt wear the clothes she wanted. She changed the way I dressed, told me I wasnt allowed to use the perfume I like because she claimed to be allergic to it. She wanted me to be very feminine and girlie and Im naturally not. Indeed, for most of her twenties, Sam had been binding her breasts, and came out to her friends as transgender. (Sam has agreed for BuzzFeed News to use female pronouns as at the time it was a lesbian relationship.) When Sam tried to wear shirts and ties, Lynn would respond with constant negative comments: Are you trying to be butch? Youre not a fucking butch, Im butch, look at me, what the fuck are you trying to do? Sam stops for a moment. When someone does that to you day in, day out, you just erode. When Sam tried to challenge Lynn who was significantly older or tell her that her behaviour was upsetting. She would generally laugh or belittle or say I was being a baby. Many of their friends were mutual and so when Sam finally escaped after several months, she lost them too. She says they did not believe her. It was a singularly lonely time, she says, but it wasnt her last experience of abuse. Although nothing since then has been as violent, any hints of bullying trigger past events, and push her to flee. Now single, Sam finally feels able to begin healing the internal scars. My self-esteem has been shot to pieces, she says. Its taken years to rebuild, to get me back to a place where I realise Im worthy of love that isnt transactional or conditional. Im so pleased I dont have to worry now about anybody elses reactions, or run anything by anyone or worry about my boundaries being pushed around. Sam does worry about the lack of discussion, both publicly and privately, about LGBT domestic abuse. A lot of that silence is about shame, she says. And about community we are a close-knit community and when I admitted to a few close friends what was happening, I lost them because everybody knows everybody. She adds: It feels like a conspiracy of silence. Compounding this, says Sam, is the fact that many LGBT people are so used to being bullied at school, and so used to the male-female notion of domestic abuse, that often they do not recognise what is happening. View this image  Rebecca Hendin It is something that Jo Harvey Barringer frequently finds in the work Broken Rainbow does. But, she says, this is far from the only barrier for those in need. For anyone to get any help [from mainstream services] they have to out themselves, explains Harvey Barringer. Whereas one of the things we offer, especially on the helpline, is the guarantee that the person you speak to will identify as LGBT, which takes away the anxiety of having to say, My partner is another woman or Im trans. Some employees at mainstream services, she adds, are also not sufficiently aware of issues specific to LGBT victims, such as female-to-female rape and sexual assault, in part because of received heterosexual ideas about what constitutes abuse. Were also seeing a real trend of gay men who are HIV-positive and their HIV status being used as a form of control, says Harvey Barringer. Either through threatening to reveal their HIV status or their partner withholding medication. This also occurs with partners of trans people withholding their hormone treatment. Even when LGBT people seek help from agencies that are supposed to support and protect those in need, she adds, many face further problematic assumptions. Peoples experiences of the police, health service, and housing services is one of coming up against a very stereotypical view of what domestic violence looks like, says Harvey Barringer. There was a lesbian who went to A&E with broken bones and reported to A&E that her same-sex partner had pushed her down the stairs. A&E did everything they should have done to ensure her safety except that when her partner turned up to the hospital and said she was a friend they gave her immediate access to her. Harvey Barringer adds: That woman ended up going home to her partner that night and not ringing another service until she rang us. Some police forces are really good, some are really bad; it depends where you live. Weve had stories of police officers saying to a trans woman, You used to be a bloke once; why didnt you give him a slap back? There is only one police force in the UK that specifically documents domestic abuse within LGBT relationships: Manchester police. The true scale of the problem, therefore, remains unknown. It is here, as Harvey Barringer continues to fill in the blanks, that a catch-22 situation emerges: No one knows how prevalent the problem is, so mainstream services and agencies dont offer specialist help for LGBT people, so LGBT people dont come forward. And the one organisation Broken Rainbow that does offer LGBT-specific support is under threat, in part because the government does not know how big the need is, because there arent the crime figures from the police. Last month several news outlets reported that Broken Rainbow faced closure by the end of the financial year. But although the Home Office has now indicated that it will fund the helpline for another year, Harvey Barringer tells BuzzFeed News they have not received official confirmation of this, or indeed how much the funding will be. We have lost other funding due to the delay in the Home Office decision and will now struggle to make it through to the end of the month and through April whilst we wait for any new contract with the Home Office to be signed, she says. We dont have enough cash flow to get us through to the first Home Office grant. The whole organisation will close if we do not bring in 20,000. One of the problems has been a switch from funding over several years, to governments grants on a yearly basis. Were not able to plan, she says, adding that this is despite having a three- to four-year strategy. And its really hard to get other funders on board because they like to see commitment from existing funders. Year-on-year funding is not sustainable for small organisations like us. With no guarantees, and a team of 17, she says they will have to give out redundancy notices. It has a domino effect on the whole organisation. With the only LGBT domestic abuse service struggling to survive amid wider mainstream agencies not always able to deal with LGBT-specific cases, it is perhaps not surprising that many who wish to flee simply stay with their partner. Or, in some instances, return to them. Mark was 20 when he first met Ralph in a local pub. The power imbalance was evident immediately, he says. Mark describes himself then as chubby and insecure. He was also still wasnt out. By contrast, Ralph was openly gay and much admired for his looks, a lust figure among the regulars at the bar. He was the most charming person in the world, says Mark. He couldnt do enough for people. Everyone was taken in. View this image  Rebecca Hendin Mark was so flattered that Ralph paid him attention and wanted to start dating that the beginning of their relationship was overwhelmingly heady. I thought, Look how lucky I am! Ive found Mr. Perfect! he says sadly. On a scale of 1 to 10 my confidence then was about a 3. When I was with him I gained confidence because he was there. It would not last long. Without realising what was happening, Mark, who ran a shop, says he found himself paying for everything: meals out, holidays, trips to the theatre. Hed charm you to get what he wanted, he says. A few months into their relationship, after they had moved in together, the financial control morphed into something more dramatic. They went away for a couple of days to Sheffield where Ralph had grown up. On the first night, they went out with local friends of Ralphs, as well as Ralphs ex-boyfriend. Mark says the two former lovers ignored him all evening and sneaked off for a while. The following night when the three of them were walking home to Ralphs mothers house after the same thing had happened, Mark and Ralph started arguing, drunkenly. I was getting upset and he started telling me to shut up or else he would shut me up. But I didnt shut up because I was still crying, says Mark. He started lashing out, punching and kicking me. His ex jumped in the middle and stopped him and calmed him down but the police arrived, and while his ex was telling them that we were just messing around, Ralph took me aside and said, Dont say anything. Scared, Mark kept quiet. No one was arrested. The abusive behaviour began fanning out in different directions. I would always dress smartly shirt and trousers, but he would say, What are you dressing like that? You look like a fag. Everyones going to be looking at you. He craved attention and hated when I got it. So he started dictating what I would wear. I couldnt wear anything that didnt look straight. Some nights, says Mark, when they were out together at their local gay bar, Ralph, seething with jealously, forbade Mark from talking to his own friends, and would insist on going to the toilet with him, in case anyone accosted Mark. They were living in their new flat in south London, with many of their belongings still in bags, when the violence escalated one night, six months into their relationship. Ralph had told Mark before they went to their friends for dinner that they had to leave at 9.30pm as he had work early the next morning. It got to 9.30pm and I said, Shall I order a cab? and he said, No, its fine. It got to 10pm and he said the same thing. When we eventually left he starting shouting at me outside, Youre gonna make me late for work in the morning. When they got home, Mark took a carton of milk out of the fridge and started drinking it, knowing that Ralph hated it when he did so. I was shaking because I knew what was coming, he says. Ralph came into the kitchen and saw Mark drinking. He punched the carton right away and started going crazy. Punching, kicking. It was really physical hes 63 and stocky. He threw me across the front room. Mark tried to fight back, but Ralph dodged the punch. Marks hand went through a window. Shards of glass stuck in his wrist. But violence wasnt enough for Ralph, says Mark. We had been decorating and he picked up the paint tins and poured it all over my belongings. Amid the din of shouting and smashing the neighbours phoned the police. They didnt seem to take it seriously, says Mark. They took the piss. He adopts a snide, mocking tone to mimic the officers: So, hes your boyfriend. So youre gay. He stops for a moment before returning to his own voice. I needed some sympathy, and to know that I was going to get some support, and it just wasnt there. The police took Ralph away and released him the following day. Ralph came back home to find that one of his suits was among the belongings that he had poured paint on. I had to go and buy him a new suit, even though he had damaged it, says Mark. He did not know where to go for help, and had only heard of the Lesbian and Gay Switchboard helpline. But I didnt have the balls to ring them up because it was embarrassing to be beaten up by my boyfriend. Mark adds that had he been aware of Broken Rainbow he thinks he would have mustered the courage to contact them. Either way, he says, he was still suffering from shame around his sexuality, and with almost no-one knowing he was in a relationship with a man, he could not tell many of his friends either. My mum didnt have a clue that he was my boyfriend, says Mark. And when it happens to you it throws you, you feel so weak, I had nobody to talk to, so I thought maybe this is what Ive got to put up with. After his experience with the police, Mark didnt feel he could rely on the law to protect him, or even understand what was happening. Finally, in fear of the violence escalating further, Mark waited until Ralph was out at work one day, packed some belongings, and left. He changed his phone number, stopped going to the pub in which they met, and tried to sever all contact. It didnt work. He used to send me flowers, says Mark. The card would just say sorry. He used to say sorry so often the word still means nothing to me. But two years after Mark left, Ralph persuaded him to return. He turned up at Marks place of work, bereft from his grandmother dying, wanting support. He asked if we could just meet up for a drink, says Mark, who agreed. We spoke about his nan and he said how sorry he was [about how he used to behave] and we started dating again. He knew what buttons to press. Mark pauses to think about his decision to reignite the relationship, aware how others can judge those who return. But I always say to people, Unless youve been in that situation you cant really judge. He knew how to manipulate my emotions, hed stir up old feelings. Although Ralph never hit Mark again, what lay beneath the violence began to resurface. The jealousy was still there: Who are you going out with? Where are you going? Why arent I invited? Disturbed by the jealousy and the gnawing feeling that underneath little had changed, Mark ended the relationship. Several years later, however, the effects linger. He caused me to have this fear anytime someone gets aggressive. I go and watch football matches and as soon as I start hearing the c-word, things like that can make me feel I flash back to that time. In relationships now, Mark says he has to tell boyfriends that he will not have arguments with them, that they can sit and discuss disagreements, but that he will walk away if they want a fight. If anyone raises their voice to me I get shaky and scared. Like Sam, Mark thinks domestic abuse in LGBT relationships is even more hidden than among straight people. Theres a lot more violence than people realise, he says, adding that he wishes he could go back and talk to himself at that age. Id say, If someone does that to you they dont love you. He thinks for a moment and adds: You need to love yourself. His voice cracks, suddenly flooded with sadness. But as Mark clears his throat, steeling himself to carry on, its clear that what he is experiencing is more than just an echo of the past. Its still there, he says. The memories have never gone. Names and other details have been changed to protect peoples identities. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Mike Freer wants to stamp out conversion therapy, but, he told BuzzFeed News, he needs LGBT people whove been subjected to such cures to give testimony. View this image  Nicholas Chinardet Some refer to attempts by therapists to turn people straight as gay cures. Mostly the practice is known as conversion therapy and has been used on lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people for decades. But every major mental health body in Britain and the USA condemns it as harmful. And now a Conservative MP is hoping to banish conversion therapy for good and is asking the public for help. Mike Freer, MP for Finchley and Golders Green, has unveiled plans to try to stamp out the controversial treatment by introducing state regulation for all therapists. Freer told BuzzFeed News he is seeking to introduce legislation against aversion therapy, a largely historical method in which mental health practitioners use electric shocks or nausea-inducing medication to try to suppress a patients sexuality or gender identity. To advance his plans, he is calling for testimonies from LGBT people who have experienced the treatments, particularly conversion therapy, to demonstrate that it is carried out in this country even though both academic studies and journalistic exposes have already highlighted it. We need to be able to say [to the Department of Health], Look, here is the hard evidence: There are people who have been referred for some form of conversion therapy, whether through the NHS or not, he said. So if anybody has been through the process, we want them to come forward. Studies have shown that the majority of people who undergo conversion therapy are left with worsened mental health as a result leaving many disinclined to speak out. But Freer said that doing so now could be instrumental in putting an end to such treatments. People can remain anonymous if thats what they wish, and if they dont thats equally helpful, he said, but they need to come forward because if people start to speak out then that combination of voices is much more powerful than people like me on the sidelines saying its an issue, because others can simply say, Well, prove it. To help Freer collate the responses, Stonewall, the LGBT rights organisation, has set up a page on its website where people can submit their testimony. Freer said both aversion and conversion therapy are harmful examples of quackery, because you cant convert somebody from something that is not convertible. The easier bit is to simply outlaw aversion therapy where you can categorically say that is illegal and specify the attempt to change someones sexuality by the administering of drugs or electrodes, he said. View this image  Mike Freer He added: The hardest part is how you stop people behind closed doors from saying, I can talk you out of being gay. Thats what I want to achieve. However, Freer hopes that bringing all counsellors and psychotherapists under a statutory body that would regulate them under one code of conduct and disciplinary procedure would be a powerful preventative measure. You have to make statutory regulation a stepping point [to ending conversion therapy], which is a bit of a cumbersome process, but in order that within such regulation therapists cannot do this kind of work, he said. Currently, there is no state regulation for psychotherapists or counsellors, only a voluntary central register. Neither psychotherapist nor counsellor are what is known as a protected title. This means that unlike doctors, nurses, or psychiatrists, anyone call themselves a counsellor or psychotherapist without needing any training, experience, or qualifications. Instead, there are private, independent professional organisations of which some counsellors and therapists are members. But membership is not compulsory and none are answerable to any government body. This means that if one of these bodies wanted to allow conversion therapy it could, and if an organisation withdrew a therapists membership, they could simply carry on practicing elsewhere. In a strange anomaly, however, certain specialist therapists are regulated, such as art therapists and music therapists coming under the control of the Health and Care Professionals Council but psychotherapists are not. People have been trying to introduce regulation for several years, said Freer. Im not the first, and in terms of the issues facing the LGBT community there have been other, bigger battles, but this is still a problem. Regulation will put all forms of counselling on an equal footing, with protection for the professionals as well as the [service] users. Freer said an open letter signed by over 80 therapists sent this week to the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP), Britains largest private body for therapists, urging the organisation to recognise that conversion therapy is administered to trans people, spurred him on to try to introduce state regulation. YouTube Nicolas Chinardet If the BACP dont see it [trans conversion therapy] as a problem then we [the government] have to deal with it, he said. If you make it a statutory issue were saying to them, Just because you dont recognise it as a problem doesnt mean we dont. But he conceded that the introduction of a law banning aversion therapy and regulating psychotherapy could be a difficult, lengthy battle that might not succeed. Primary legislation is a very slow process and thats even if you can find a slot in the parliamentary calendar. At this stage, once we can bring forward the evidence then we can sit down with the relevant administrator and say, Right what can we do about this? If that primary legislation takes two years, then it takes two years. If we can do it in a faster way then we will. As recently as November 2015, the Department of Health revealed that it did not intend to regulate therapists. I fully understand the concerns about so-called gay conversion therapy, said health minister Jane Ellison during a Westminster Hall debate, but the government has no current plans to ban or restrict it via legislation. We dont either have a plan currently to introduce statutory regulation of psychotherapies, but I say that in the knowledge that it is a position that is challenged and one to which I will go away and reflect [upon] after the debate. A spokesman for the Department of Health told BuzzFeed News that in lieu of regulation, the department has been working with the key therapy and counselling organisations over the last three years. The group has published a Memorandum of Understanding committing them to a range of activities including training and awareness raising amongst their members which we believe will further minimise the risk of LGB people being offered this type of therapy. The group is working towards extending the MoU to include transgender people. The last Labour government embarked on a consultation process with various bodies for psychotherapy, who were divided on the issue. When approached by BuzzFeed News, the United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy refused to state its position: Until there is a proposal for statutory regulation we cannot provide a comment as to whether we would support it or not. In a statement, a BACP spokesperson appeared to support regulation in some form, saying: BACP is committed to working within a regulatory framework that will deliver the high professional standards and level of public protection that is expected of BACP members (through the BACP Ethical Framework for Good Practice in Counselling and Psychotherapy) across the whole counselling and psychotherapy professions.

aS"No television drama shall show abnormal sexual relationships and behaviors, new guidelines say. View this image  Weibo Broadcast officials in China are censoring programs that feature gay characters as part of a new series of measures to tighten control on media and the arts in the country. This was spelled out in a lengthy set of guidelines entitled General Regulations on Television Content Production issued by the government-backed TV Production Committee of the China Alliance of Radio, Film and Television and a trade group called the China Television Drama Production Industry Association. The guidelines are dated December 31, but only circulated this week after the countrys top broadcast regulator, Li Jingsheng, mentioned them at a speech during a national TV production conference. View this image  Poster for Addiction, which was pulled from streaming sites last week. Douban / Via movie.douban.com No television drama shall show abnormal sexual relationships and behaviors, such as incest, same-sex relationships, sexual perversion, sexual assault, sexual abuse, sexual violence, and so on, the document states. It also frowns upon a range of other content ranging from witchcraft to historical depictions harmful to the unity and sovereignty of the country and its territorial integrity. Though the document does not technically have the force of law, several shows that might not meet the requirements have recently disappeared from streaming sites. These include a web series called Addiction about gay teenagers, which was blocked last week. It is also a powerful signal to the industry that producers should self-censor in order to avoid running afoul of authorities. Other steps Chinese authorities have recently taken to tighten controls include a prohibition on foreign media companies from publishing online content in the country and another to punish the owners of unusual architecture. In his speech to the TV production conference, Li said that he wanted to take further steps to ensure online entertainment meets the same standards as broadcast television. Stepped up censorship of LGBT content comes at a time of growing visibility for gays and lesbians in China. Last year, Chinas largest company ran a public competition for ten couples to win a trip to get married in California, and the Chinese courts are allowing a well publicized lawsuit by a couple seeking to marry to proceed. But representation in media is still sensitive, so sensitive that a reality TV show recently blurred out an actor who posted something LGBT-related on Facebook from a show that had already been filmed.

aS"So many makeup tips. instagram.com instagram.com Instagram: @torahymen View this image  Theres often a lot of body hair removal, says Charisma. Were changing our faces completely and were not using any of our actual features to create our drag looks. So it takes a while to get all of that perfected. Logo TV Logo TV When you have a mans bone structure, you need that extra thickness to create the illusion, says Tora. So if youre looking to get the same coverage and staying power of drag makeup, you might need to look outside of Sephora. View this image  Primer is a must have, says Charisma. It creates a barrier so it protects your skin and the makeup stays on it. View this image  To keep you looking flawless all night long. View this image  If you want your makeup to stay fresh all night, use powder whenever you see shine. You remove your makeup with oil, so when your skin starts to get oily, itll remove your makeup from the inside out, says Courtney. You need to just keep powdering your face, especially the forehead, nose, and chin. View this image  Your hair will just stick to it. Instead, put glitter on with eyelash glue. Put a touch of eyelash glue on your lips, and put good-quality craft glitter over the top. It dries hard but still looks shiny, says Tora. View this image  Most drag queens use baby wipes, followed by baby oil, to take off all their makeup. You can also use coconut or olive oil. I just pour coconut oil into my hand and rub it all over my face, says Courtney. Then I wipe it off with a towel, and cleanse with warm water. This is especially good for hard-to-remove oil-based foundations. View this image  You put your eyelash glue on to the false eyelash, you pop it onto your eyelid where you know you want it to be, then remove it for about 10 seconds, says Charisma. Then put it in place. It allows the glue to get tacky so once you pop it on itll stay. View this image  We often put three or four pairs together for extra thickness, says Tora. Stick all four pairs together, and then stick them to your eye in one hit. Always put your lashes on last. If you put them on any earlier, makeup gets all over them. View this image  If you have any glue left on your eyelids, use coconut oil on a cotton bud to clear it all up. View this image  Though often theyll get a sewer to make them. You need to have a strong input because you have an image in your mind of what will go with your song and your shoes and your headdress, said Tora. You need to achieve the look that youre looking for. View this image  We put most of it on, says Charisma. In any job that you do theres always going to be someone that you dont get along with or you dont like. And in this industry where there are limited jobs, of course sometimes, there is going to be some form of rivalry. But for the most part, we help each other out and were all friends. View this image  Drag queens work really hard to get to a point where they get enough jobs. You get a lot of new people who come in and think that they can have that straight away, says Tora. As long as youre respectful of the people who come before you, and are thankful of the opportunity youre given and respectful of the hierarchy, youll do just fine. View this image  The general misconception is that drag queens want to be women, says Courtney. There is a definite difference between a man in a dress for entertainment value and creating a character, and someone who is genuinely questioning their gender in day-to-day life, says Charisma. View this image  Someone at an office will go home at the end of the day and take off their suit and tie, says Tora. Drag queens go home at the end of the night and take off their makeup and dress and shoes and wig. We wear regular clothes just like everyone else. View this image  When were in drag and were dressed as a woman, we want to get referred to with female pronouns, says Charisma. Its annoying when people make a point of saying we know whats underneath that. View this image  For anyone starting drag, you have to be prepared for the fact that for the first few years, youre not going to be making any money, says Tora. Every single cent is going back into doing it. You need to make sure you look good, and have a decent wardrobe, and buy makeup and wigs. A good wig is about $450, and new dress may cost about $350 to have it made properly. Then you need to buy stockings and jewellery and earrings and shoes. It takes a while to get to the point where you have enough drag jobs to support your career. View this image  You initially have to really prove yourself and learn the craft, before you are taken seriously, says Charisma. You have to learn the design and makeup, and learn the skills that are involved in becoming a professional queen. Its just like anything else. You dont become a doctor overnight. View this image  When it was released, it was a great representation of what drag was at that point in time, says Charisma. But now we have a much bigger variety of what drag is and can be.

aS"What if Edward Scissorhands had been gay? Almost everyone grew up falling in love with life-changing films that they still look back on fondly. But for same-sex attracted, bisexual, or transgender people, its always been difficult or near impossible to see a mainstream movie featuring an authentic representation of the LGBT community. Tania Safi In 2014-15, the University of California conducted a study of movies plus broadcast, cable, and digital series and found only 2% out of 11,194 speaking characters were lesbian, gay, or bisexual. The LGBT films that do exist are often comedies, and do not feature healthy relationships or depict same-sex parents. So BuzzFeed teamed up with Sherbet Birdie, Audrey & Him, and The Wardrobe, got a group of LGBT people together and recreated some nostalgic films. Only this time, our LGBT stars were in the lime light View this image  Tania Safi (Edward Scissorhands) - I am such a sucker for film and all kinds of romance in cinema, so I do find heteroromantic movies relatable. But theres nothing like watching two women fall in love on screen. I am able to feel what they feel, connect to their ups and downs, and indulge in their experiences as if it were happening to me. Its really a breath of fresh air. Today was just a dream come true!  Jemima Skelley (Kim) - If there is a femme lesbian in a film who likes to wear makeup and dresses, theyre usually bi or theyre just a college girl going through a phase. This makes me feel pretty crappy to be honest, its like Im being told that Im not a ~real~ lesbian. View this image  View this image  View this image  Kael Murray (Daisy Buchanan) - I have seen some terrible films and only because there was one single LGBT person in them. Itd be nice to live in a time where LGBT representation was on par with hetero representation in mainstream cinema! I think that time will come, though. View this image  View this image  Anna Boydell (Jack Dawson) - In most lesbian films, being gay is usually a struggle and the resolution is typically ending up with a man. Id love to see a film where being gay is just one aspect of their character, not the entire spotlight of the film. And where a man doesnt need to save her from a life of lesbian struggle Corinne Goode (Rose DeWitt Bukater) - Seeing a queer character on screen is a unicorn moment. My wife and I always excitedly nudge each other in the cinema with a its one of us expression. My wife is a huge romantic film buff so it was such a cool experience to recreate the Titanic flying scene with her. It was nice to indulge in the fantasy that this film could have a equally strong love story if it was based on two women. View this image  View this image  Brad Martin (Edward Cullen) - As a white cis-gendered man, I am probably represented a lot more than other people from my community. But quite often the gay role is relegated to a background role, a side kick, a comic relief rather than an actual fleshed out three dimensional character. View this image  View this image  Gary Paramanathan (Edward Lewis) - All I recall from the films I watched growing up are LGBT caricatures, comedians acting up gay characters. We werent real people capable of love; at best we were supportive sidekicks. And the LGBT films that do exist are all about white people, and predominantly young gay white butch men. Jerico Mandybur (Vivian Ward) - As a bisexual person (with mixed heritage) I rarely see myself represented in mainstream culture. My experience is largely that of bisexual erasure when it comes to representation in film, or if they exist, they are either framed as promiscuous and reckless or erotic and fluid. Rarely are they framed as regular people with jobs and mortgages. Bisexual characters are usually the ones who come into a story to cause trouble. View this image  View this image  View this image  Sonia Tsai (Danny) - I was nervous at first but then really got into it. I really tried to channel the sleaziness of John Travolta but not sure I did his thrusty hips justice. Makayla Otford (Sandy) - Netflix needs to get their shit together! Have you seen their options? Its laughable. View this image  View this image  Kadeem Alphanso (Romeo) - There is very little evidence of black gay men in mainstream media. Frequently if there is a black gay character, he is hyper-feminine and made into a caricature. Always the flamboyant, ghetto, finger-snapping, vogueing queen. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this type of Queen - but it would be nice to see more variety in the way being black and gay are shown in mainstream media. View this image  View this image  View this image  Hilary Conroy (Frances Baby Houseman) - As a bi person dating a trans person, I rarely see my identity represented in mainstream cinema in a realistic and positive way. The lack of representation of people like myself and my partner can feel somewhat isolating. Dressing up and recreating Dirty Dancing was so fun. I also particularly enjoyed the role reversed lift. My partner is a babe and could give Swayze a run for his money any day. Jax Wearing (Johnny Castle) - As a transgendered person, I have not seen my identity represented in mainstream media but for being presented as a joke or a freak. LGBT films recognise me and give me a place in the world. This is so critical especially to young people growing up who may be struggling with their diversity. Our LGBT crowd is beautiful and strong and unique. There is so much to experience by us being a part of these types of projects that likely show us off to the mainstream. View this image  View this image  View this image  Samuel Leighton-Dore (Allie Hamilton) - As a gay man, I definitely feel there are representations of my identity reflected in cinema (though perhaps not mainstream), however they often arrive in the form of composite characters with no real nuance, depth or originality. If I could, Id create a world where LGBT stories werent so defined by adversity, pain and struggle; where queer filmmakers had the confidence to explore the subtler sides of sexuality in an optimistic light, in a way that celebrated the commonality of love.

View this image  PR Image His speech was well-received, and in a follow up email, the staff member said they would be honoured to have him back in 2016 to launch The Sidekicks. After getting back in touch with Kostakis in February this year, the school booked him to do a meet and greet about The Sidekicks on March 30, and then a longer talk in June. However, about a week later, Kostakis received the email asking him to not speak about The Sidekicks. If you want to promote The First Third on March 30, you are more than welcome however I have been advised we cant promote your new book, the staff member wrote. We still absolutely want you in June, but if possible can you please do the same talk as last year with focus on becoming an author and The First Third?

It was in light of the recent debate over the Safe Schools Coalition, an anti-bullying program aimed at helping LGBTI kids, that Kostakis decided to come out. It was after that really rough first week of the debate, he said. I thought, this is harrowing, my whole book is about the danger of closets, but Im still sort of leaving it. I just need to stand up and go, look, actually, I am a positively contributing member of society. I like to inspire kids to creatively write. I am not a danger to anyone. Kostakis said the attitudes he experienced in dealing with De La Salle were something he has seen throughout Catholic schools. Ive seen these sorts of attitudes around, and one school could have been another school. You can read the full email exchange on Kostakiss blog. De La Salle College has been contacted for comment.

Because having lost my partner in a horrible pedestrian accident this month I had to ask policemen if I was allowed to write Spouse on incident reports. I had to cross out boxes for husband on the death certificate and boxes for father on our new babys birth certificate (both on the same day). I had to yell out in a busy, crazy emergency room She is my wife, I know its not legal but she is my wife!Because we were never political, we just did our thing, did our life our way and tried to live by example to shift peoples hearts rather than pushing agendas. BUT the amount of freaking paper work I am having to do to secure mine and my childrens future welfare is just ridiculous when all it would take is one marriage certificate. And most of all because I love her, and she has been my every day for ten years, She is the mother of our two girls, she is the future I dreamed of and she is my safe place to land.Because love is love and we should celebrate it and encourage it always.The world is harsh enough.

aS"Its on, and thats not on. View this image  Dan Himbrechts / AAPIMAGE The big fella was ~erected~ in Sydneys Hyde Park last week as part of the citys annual Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. Its not technically a dick though. Its a condom over the 18-metre-tall Hyde Park obelisk, promoting a message of safe sex. Every year around 80% of HIV transmissions in NSW are among men who have sex with men, so its vital that we use opportunities like Mardi Gras to remind gay men about the health benefits of using condoms, said Nicolas Parkhill, CEO of ACON, NSWs leading HIV prevention, HIV support and LGBT health organisation. During Mardi Gras were pulling out all the stops to get our stay safe message to gay men. The Giant Condom was a massive hit here and overseas when we put it up for World AIDS Day in 2014, so we thought wed roll it out again for this years Mardi Gras to act as a highly visible safe sex reminder, not just for locals but also for the thousands of international visitors who come to Sydney for Mardi Gras. Brook Mitchell / Getty Images But the safe sex message has upset some people, with the Australian Christian Lobby labelling it distasteful and completely inappropriate. We recognise the need to combat HIV in our community but this is not the appropriate way to deal with the issue, the ACLs Wendy Francis said. My position on this is always that the government and the community have a responsibility to our children. The ACLs chief took things one step further, linking the giant condom to child sexual abuse. And we wonder why 4 year olds sexually abuse their friends at kindy.

aS"The bill would have made Dennis Daugaards state the first in the U.S. to ban transgender students from using school restrooms that correspond with their gender identity. View this image  AP / Michael Conroy South Dakota Gov. Dennis Daugaard on Tuesday vetoed a bill that would have banned transgender students from using school restrooms that correspond with their gender identity, heeding to pressure from LGBT advocates and a fear of lawsuits. South Dakota would have been the first state in the nation with such a policy risking a legal clash with the Obama administration, which has argued similar rules constitute illegal discrimination when enacted by local school districts in other states. Republican backers of the bill who control both chambers of the legislature had said they were responding to the federal governments recent advocacy for transgender students. They argued the bill was needed to protect student privacy and safety from transgender students in restrooms. But Daugaard countered in a veto letter that local school officials are best positioned to address those rare situations if and when they arise. Instead of encouraging local solutions, this bill broadly regulates in a manner that invites conflict and litigation, diverting energy and resources from the education of the children of this state, Daugaard wrote. House Bill 1008 does not address any pressing issue concerning the school districts of South Dakota, he added. Local school districts can, and have, made necessary restroom and locker room accommodations that serve the best interests of all students, regardless of biological sex or gender identity. LGBT advocacy groups, businesses, and activists had in recent days pressed the Republican governor to block the measure, contending it would stigmatize transgender kids who are already ostracized and harassed. The groups including the National Center for Transgender Equality, the ACLU, Freedom for All Americans, and the Human Rights Campaign hailed the governor on Tuesday for his decision. Daugaard, meanwhile, asked state lawmakers to refrain from overriding his veto with a two-thirds majority vote. Leaping over that bar appears simple in the House, where the bill passed 58 to 10, but overcoming the governors pen may be harder in the Senate, where the bill passed 20 to 15. That means at least three senators would need to reverse their votes to reach the two-thirds threshold. This bill seeks to impose statewide standards on every restroom, locker room, and shower room located in a public elementary or secondary school, the governor wrote in making his case to the legislature. It removes the ability of local school districts to determine the most appropriate accommodations for their individual students and replaces that flexibility with a state mandate. For his part, Rep. Fred Deutsch released a statement appealing to his Republican colleagues to uphold the governors veto. I still believe an objective reading of the proposed law is consistent with my intent to be non-discriminatory and fair to all students and parents, he wrote. However, because I think the national focus on South Dakota should be on our positive business environment, strong labor market, and excellent work our schools do. I am going to ask my legislative colleagues to concur with the governors veto. With his veto Tuesday, Daugaard also parted with national leaders of his own party. In January, the Republican National Committee passed a resolution in January that said these Obama gender identity policies are a federal governmental overreach. That resolution also encourages state legislatures to enact laws that protect student privacy and limit the use of restrooms, locker rooms and similar facilities to students based solely on their birth sex. House Bill 1008 which applies only to public schools states that every restroom, locker room, and shower room located in a public elementary or secondary school that is designated for student use and is accessible by multiple students at the same time shall be designated for and used only by students of the same biological sex. The bill defines biological sex as the physical condition of being male or female as determined by a persons chromosomes and anatomy as identified at birth. The bill does not mention transgender people specifically, but it is the latest step in a march to ban transgender people from using restrooms that reflect their gender identity. Conservative organizations have united around a battle cry of banning men in womens bathrooms to push such policies and to block LGBT nondiscrimination laws arguing that they are protecting women and girls from sex predators. However, in the 17 states and roughly 225 cities with LGBT nondiscrimination laws, there are no documented incidents of the laws being used as a defense for such nefarious restroom behavior. Tell @SDGovDaugaard to protect trans kids by vetoing #HB1008. https://t.co/aui4kiIcD5 Under Obama, the justice and education departments have argued that Title IX of the Education Act of 1972 which bans discrimination in publicly funded schools on the basis of sex also bans transgender discrimination as a form of sex discrimination. The agencies have advanced that Title IX interpretation by pushing several school districts into compliance when local officials attempted to deny transgender students access to school restrooms and locker rooms reflecting their gender identity. In courts again citing Title IX the Justice Department has weighed in to support a transgender student in the countrys most advanced lawsuit over student restroom access. Federal lawyers filed an amicus brief before the 4th Circuit Court in October backing a transgender boy trying to overturn a Virginia county school districts policy. In South Dakota, the bill makes a gesture to providing a reasonable accommodation for transgender students such as providing a single-person restroom but that could not include allowing trans students to use restrooms that reflect their gender identity. Senate Democrats raised concerns during a floor debate last week that the bill may risk the state losing federal education funding for violating Title IX. Preserving local control is particularly important because this bill would place every school district in the difficult position of following state law while knowing it openly invites federal litigation, Daugaard said. This law will create a certain liability for school districts and the state in an area where no such liability exists today. View this embed  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed two lawsuits on Tuesday, arguing that sexual orientation discrimination is barred by the sex discrimination ban in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. View this image  David Zalubowski / AP WASHINGTON The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed two lawsuits in federal court on Tuesday, alleging that two companies engaged in anti-gay discrimination in violation of existing civil rights laws. The move is the latest in the EEOCs aggressive efforts in recent years to seek protections for LGBT workers under existing civil rights laws, most notably Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which bars most private employers from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. In Maryland, the EEOC sued Pallet Companies, alleging that the company discriminated against Yolanda Boone by subjecting her to harassment because she is a lesbian, resulting in her being fired, and by retaliating against Boone when she complained about the harassment. In Pennsylvania, the EEOC sued Scott Medical Health Center, alleging that the company subjected [Dale] Baxley to a sexually hostile work environment by Baxleys manager. The EEOC alleges that Baxley, who is gay, was effectively fired by the company a legal term called constructive discharge by failing to address the intolerable working conditions. This past July, the EEOC ruled that discrimination based on sexual orientation is barred by the sex discrimination ban in Title VII. Earlier this year, the EEOC weighed in with an amicus curiae or, friend of the court brief in an ongoing case urging that a federal appeals court hold that sexual orientation discrimination is illegal under Title VII. Tuesdays filings, however, are the first time the EEOC has used its authority to file its own lawsuits alleging that anti-LGB employment discrimination (based on sexual orientation) is barred under Title VII. The commission, which operates independent of the Obama administration, previously has filed lawsuits alleging that anti-transgender discrimination (based on gender identity) is barred by Title VIIs sex discrimination ban (following a 2012 commission decision on that issue). The Obama administration, through the Justice Department, eventually announced that it agreed with the EEOCs view later filing supportive court briefs and its own lawsuit on the issue. The Justice Department has not, however, taken an explicit position in support of the EEOCs view as to coverage of sexual orientation discrimination. Earlier this year, though, it did take a first step toward recognizing the argument by declining to seek outright dismissal of a lawsuit filed against the Transportation Department based on the argument. The Pennsylvania case has been assigned to Judge Cathy Bissoon, an Obama appointee to the federal bench. The Maryland case has been assigned to Judge Richard D. Bennett, appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush. View this image  View this embed  View this image  View this embed  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"As I grow older, Ive become more comfortable saying I dont know. View this image  Andrew Richard / BuzzFeed I love asking for advice, almost as much as I love giving it. I used to be pretty convinced I had a singular talent for it, and that misplaced confidence only grew when I was hired to write an advice column for money. Part of it is just that I love to hear myself talk to notice how I explain a problem differently depending on my audience, the tones I adopt and words I choose to best convey the issue at hand. The interchange of advice is always a matter of presentation, though I forget that at least half the time. I love when someone Im asking for advice tells me theyve gone through the exact same thing I have, and I even love when, as they continue talking, it becomes clear that its not the same thing at all. I love hearing advice I wanted to hear, because then I feel right. But I also like hearing advice I dont agree with, because then I get to feel right and superior, which are two of my favorite feelings to have. Recently, though, both the acts of giving and getting advice have left me feeling slightly uneasy. Things that well-meaning people have said to me burrow into my skull like worms, wriggling around there for days until they are knocked out by the next piece of supposedly sage wisdom. Left too long in my worriers brain, suggestions so easily become maxims, and generalizations start sounding like facts. I worry more now, too, about doing to others what I know their advice can do to me. There are a few things I could ascribe this shift to: One is simply that I have grown up, and so have the people I know and care for, and with that growth has only come more awareness of the irregularity and irrationality of human behavior. Another is that I am, for the first time in my life, in a real relationship. And then there is the fact that the person I am in a relationship with is a woman, whom I met shortly after coming out at the age of 28, surprising most people I know, including me. And so I think: If I can go 28 years through life not really knowing something so essential to my self, how much can I really be expected to know about anything? And if nobody who knows me well had any idea either, how can I expect them to know anything else about me? This recognition of imperfection in myself and my loved ones has been difficult to accept as a lifetime disciplinarian and boringly well-behaved person, I would have preferred if everything really were black and white. But it has also been a gift to my anxious, neurotic brain. No longer do I view my friends as necessarily more omniscient than I am simply because they are not me. It is not that I no longer see my friends as smart or empathetic; rather, it is that I feel more able to see them as human. View this image  Now, too, it is easier for me to look backward at my younger self and recognize the liberal doses of self-righteousness and navet that accompanied much of my own well-meaning advice. (A tendency that, in part, inspired the know-it-all advice columnist character Harriet in my book, Dear Emma.) For most of my life I was a girl with zero relationship experience whose favorite advice was Dump him. It was because I thought there was nobody alive good enough for my friends, and because so many boyfriends are truly useless, but it was also because I wanted the friend in question to spend less time with the boyfriend and more with me, and because I wanted to feel that aloneness was normal, even virtuous. Everyone has an agenda be it self-preservation, pacifying reassurance, or simple shit-stirring. Most people give advice they just hope is true. When I ask for advice, it is usually because I want someone to tell me that I am OK, that my relationship is OK, that everything will work out the way I want it to. It is extremely difficult for me to trust my gut, particularly when I know for a fact that my gut confused by anxiety is so frequently full of shit. I would prefer to rely on someone else, anyone else. But though I feel pacified when I do get advice I hoped to hear, Im increasingly aware that that contentment does not last. No feeling is a permanent one, and nobody really knows what will happen to me. Including me. This is not a promise that I will stop trying to find out. Talking to other women about our relationships and our work and our lives is essential to my being, my favorite thing to do, the way I feel closest to others. Giving and getting advice is part of that, but it doesnt have to be all of it, or even most of it. There is also sharing, commiserating, debating, and good old talking shit; there is venting without hoping or asking for anything in return. So while I may never give up advice entirely (nor am I sure thats even possible), I am attempting to cut back. I try to save most of my various concerns for my weekly therapy appointment; incidentally, Im over most of the things I planned to bring up in therapy by the time that appointment arrives. I have also fully, and finally, abandoned astrology which, after all, is not even based on anyones earthly experience, but only on the month you happened to be born in and the way the galaxy was arranged around you then. View this image  Soon after I started dating my girlfriend, she made me take this online compatibility test based on our birthdays. Im not going to link to it, because I want to spare you. What the test told us was that we were a good match for love, but a bad one for marriage. This is horrible news, I told her. Why did you do this to me. I will never forget it. Its an online quiz! she said, laughing. Its supposed to just be, like, for fun. But it was not just fun. Not for me. I freaked out, slightly, and texted the quiz to two good friends, both of whom have serious boyfriends (my apologies to them both) in order to compare their results against mine. Both said they were good matches for marriage, but not for love. Never mind that this does not make very much sense, and should at least call into question the veracity of an already very dubious romance metric we found on a shitty-ass website: That result rattled around my brain for weeks and weeks. The result had also foretold daringly that my girlfriend and I would get on each others nerves, and, consequently, any time either of us annoyed the other, I took it not as an inevitable component of any relationship between two humans, but as evidence. Id think: This is it. This is a sign. We might love each other now, but someday we wont, and that quiz will be proved right. Now, though, I know that if we do not stay together, it will not mean that the quiz was right, or that there was some crucial piece of advice I could have heeded to prevent a breakup. It will only mean that our relationship met one of the two possible outcomes of all relationships: it ends, or it doesnt. All I know is that months and months have gone by and here we are, still together. I do not know what will happen to me, and I do not know what will happen in my relationship. I do not know what will happen to you, either. I have started saying I dont know so much more freely that, somewhat ironically, it annoys my girlfriend. But to me it has become something of a mantra. I dont know. I dont know. IDK. Sometimes all the not knowing drives me crazy, but its going to be OK. At least, I think it will be. *** Katie Heaney is a senior editor at BuzzFeed and the author of popular memoir Never Have I Ever. She lives in Brooklyn. To learn more about Dear Emma, click here.

aS"I took a name that was meant to shame me and used it to empower myself. View this image  I started going by Loma three years ago. I was traveling the country and settled for a bit on a queer commune in the woods of Tennessee. That was the first place where I asked people to call me Loma, instead of my government name, Christopher Soto. As a child, friends used to call me Soto. During college, the predominately white community around me decided to start calling me Chris. I felt like Soto (the name of my childhood) was dead and Chris was a name that I never asked to be called it wasnt mine. I made up Loma instead in an attempt to reclaim myself and reclaim my gender and ethnicity. I like the a and a sounds in the word. It feels balanced in gender. Loma means hill in Spanish. I grew up at the foothills of the San Bernandino Mountains in California. I feel like a hill just starting to grow into a mountain. Loma I originally chose my name in order to respect my fathers choice to name all the men in the family after biblical figures, hoping it would make my transition easier for him. It didnt. After I chose Mark I found out that is means rebellious, which, as one of my high school teachers pointed out to me, is kind of fitting for everything youve had to go through in order to be your true self. Mark The funny thing about changing my name was that I was the only one between my mother, (biological) father, and brother with a gender-specific name. My younger brother hated his name (Kelley Lee) growing up and so did my father (Adrian Lauren) because they both thought their names were a girls name growing up. My mother (Pat) always liked hers. There simply wasnt a feminine version of my birth, first, or middle name. So I had to come up with a totally new name and I wanted one that no one I was friends with had. Initially I liked the name Samantha because I love the show Bewitched as a child, but decided that it just didnt seem to fit. I went online and searched the U.S. Census for the top female baby names around the year I was born. I found Sydney and it just clicked. I still hadnt picked a middle name so I decided to talk to my supportive mother about my name choice. I asked her what she would have named me if I had been assigned female at birth and her second choice was Sydney. I asked her about my middle name and she suggested Madison that was also my great grandfathers first name. As a young child, he was the only male figure who got me (I was a somewhat feminine child, as you can imagine) and let me be me until later my mother met my stepfather who has also been very supportive so, Sydney Madison was reborn. Sydney Madison It has been a joke in our family for as long as I can remember. Any man in my mothers life is called Chuck. It started back when my dad first shaved his head and she said he looked like Charlie Brown it only escalated from there. Her father started buying the same wine brand, one we affectionately called three-buck Chuck (the brand name was Charles something, and it was obscenely cheap for the quality). So he was therefore inducted into the joke, along with her best friend, Greg. It was that day I realized that I was a man in my mothers life, so I would eventually be called Chuck, too. I had always loved the name Charlie, so eventually it stuck. Charles View this image  My parents were really supportive and great, so I asked them to be involved in the process with me. They named me after my great-grandfather. I liked the idea of having my parents name me again. Rocco When I realized that I was transgender, it was in a pretty dark time in my life and I had a tough time coming to terms with my trans identity as well. Finally I got to a place where I had accepted myself enough to start thinking about coming out to people. The first couple of people I told were really accepting, which was hugely encouraging and something I definitely needed, and they wanted to know what pronouns I wanted to use and what name. I suddenly realized that I hadnt even thought of a name and it seemed such a huge responsibility to pick one that suited me. I tried subtly, because I wasnt out to them at that point, asking my parents what they would have called me if I was born a boy, but, unhelpfully, they couldnt remember. Eventually I decided that I wanted a name that reflected the pain and struggle it had taken to get to that point and the hope that coming out meant to me and therefore chose Phoenix. About six months later I realized that I would be known by my first name for my entire working life and an unusual first name would make me stand out which was the opposite of what I wanted. I chose a more common first name and Phoenix got booted down to a middle name. But, for me, it will always be the one that counts because it encapsulates everything about me: past, present, and future. Kyle I use to hate my name because it wasnt common and in many cultures names that end in O are for masculine persons. But now I love my name. It has a ring. And, in case there is ever any doubt, I introduce myself as Ms. BIKO. Often people struggle to pronounce it so Im known for asking audiences IRL and on social media to let me hear you say, Hey Ms. BIKO! Cherno Biko When I was young my nickname was Tee. It didnt bother me because I liked the character Mr. T from The A Team. My family pretty much just said Tee. One day while I was walking past my aunt and uncle they noticed a swish in my hips. I was about 9 years old. My aunt jokingly said, Tee, yeah right, it seems more like Tela to me. My uncle laughed hysterically. Tela became a name to taunt my femininity.  At that same time, I was crazy about a character from He-Man named Tela who was a strong fearless woman who could fight like nobodys business. Secretly I embraced the name that was meant to shame me. It stuck and everyone started to call me Tela. I tried on many drag names as I grew up Terica , Andranice, Kiki, Keshunna, Cleopatra but for some reason, even though I knew Tela was meant to shame me, it always felt real. It made me feel connected to family. I felt like it was my name changed by God like in the Bible, so when the time came to legally change it I wanted it to be Tela. I thought it would be easier for everyone to take but the funny thing was, the moment I physically and legally became Tela, my uncle who used that name to tease me for years would now call me only Antwoyne. Along my journey to Tela, I learned that its the very thing that was meant to shame us that holds the most power. I took a name that was meant to shame me, and used it to empower myself. Tela Love View this image  For years before I transitioned I played computer role playing games with female characters. One game in particular, Icewind Dale, allowed me to create six female characters that would work together. The game is set in a quasi-Scandanavian setting and my family on my fathers side is from Finland. I gave all of my characters appropriate names for Scandinavia: Dagmar, Marta, Tuulikki. I knew that there was a name that I used in one of my many saved games that would be perfect for me. I eventually found the saved file and opened it up in a text editor to find the missing name. GRETA! For hundreds of years my families gave the name Gustav to all of the male children. My grandfather was the first to break with tradition, giving my father the middle name Herbert, his first name. When my son was born, I revived the tradition, giving him the middle name Gustav. When choosing my middle name, I went with Gustava, the feminine form of Gustav, the middle name I felt that I should have had. My grandfather passed down folklore about our surname. The story goes that during one of the many times that Sweden was occupying the area that is now Finland, many Finnish families changed their last names to be more Swedish. My grandfather told us that the families real surname was Martela, which meant of the forest. Before deciding to adopt this surname I did a Google search on Greta Martela. The only hit I got was on an immigration record from the late 1800s of a Finnish woman emigrating to the United States. That sealed the deal for me. Greta Martela Fairly early in my gender questioning I realized that my given name had the same first and middle initials as Bach. Both of my parents are very into classical music so I just kind of adopted his name. I hesitated a little about picking something so unusual but I already have a German last name and I never really came up with a different option. I know a lot of trans guys end up picking really fashionable names from baby name websites but I cant imagine answering to Parker or something. Johann When I was younger, I was in a writing group on Tumblr and had a character named Chevrolet. People started calling me Charlie based off of that (I dont remember why or how) but I asked them to go to Chevy, and they did. After that group ended, I went by an alias of Mitchell for a while and didnt think about Chevy again until I started questioning things about myself maybe a year later. That year at summer camp I asked my friends to call me Chevy. I told my family after that summer the feelings I was having, and now (four years later) Im known as Chevy at school, by family, and by all of my friends online. I get people confused on if its Chevy like the car or the actor, so I just tell them that my family was really into cars.  Chevy View this image  For a few months after I started presenting as a woman I just called myself M because I knew I wanted to keep my initials, but didnt know what name I wanted to give myself and I wanted to take my time. A lot of people started writing it as Em and assuming its short for Emily, which was cute but wasnt right. Then one day, I was looking up names online and came upon Meredith, which I vaguely knew was a name that was used for men in England sometimes. I found out that Meredith is a Welsh name that used to be exclusively used for men, but then when it traveled to the U.S. it ended up becoming a womans name. That appealed to me as an immigrant, who grew up in the Philippines as male, then moved to the States and ended up living my life as a woman. The name means warrior from the sea, which is awesome and badass. Meredith When I first began my transition I asked a friend to help me pick a new name, yet after sitting together for almost two hours we still couldnt find anything that fit. I went home later and typed into google LGBT names. One of the first results the popped up was the story of Matthew Shepard. I was heartbroken to hear about the hate that led to his death, but then I read about his parents. These extraordinary people who overcame the biggest loss any parent could face and in reaction created a place that would spread a message of love and acceptance for all. Dennis Shepard talks about how he loved and accepted his son never thinking that God had made a mistake. My dad, a man who was born and raised in Wyoming with strong faith, reminded me of Mr. Shepard. The resemblance of the two also gave me hope that my dad would be able to accept me as trans once I came out to him. I learned that Matthew Shepard was born in Casper, Wyoming, just like I was and the year of his horrific accident was the same year I was born. Matthews last name Shepard began with the letter S the letter my previous name began with. I didnt pick the name Matthew because I wanted to associated with a violent hate crime. I took the name because I know that if just even one person can keep the memory of his life then maybe his story can continue to change the world. As of last week, only two people knew why I picked the name: a close friend of mine and my therapist. This past weekend, however, recently I met Judy and Dennis Shepard and I told Mr. Shepard, My name is Matthew. Matthew I am agender. I am not fully out, and therefore my family-known emails and social media still all mostly reflect this. I still have chosen and use a new name with people as much as I can, and luckily for me, this name is part of my actual birth-given name and an actual nickname that people have been known to use which makes it less awkward to explain to people Im not out to. Im Am. It is the name my father gave to me, and without him around anymore it is something I can cling to that was from him and can never be lost. Secondly, it reminds me of something extremely important. I am. I exist. Not only as Am, but I am. Im here. I matter. Im Am and I am. Thats all. Its silly, but its true, and it helps.

aS"We do not tolerate discrimination of any kind, the company told BuzzFeed News. View this image  AP / Amy Sancetta A woman said her excitement at being offered a job at a KFC in Virginia last week quickly turned to dismay when a manager rescinded the offer within an hour because she is transgender. But on Tuesday, national KFC spokespeople said in a statement to BuzzFeed News that the company decided instead to fire the manager and offer the woman, Georgia Carter, a job effective immediately. The manager has been terminated for violating the franchisees anti-discrimination policy, which is inclusive of gender identity and sexual orientation, KFC said in a statement on Tuesday to BuzzFeed News. The company said the decision came after the owner of the franchise restaurant in Richmond investigated the situation. The franchisees leadership has also had a conversation with Ms. Carter, the statement read, offering her employment at this restaurant or any of their Richmond area KFC restaurants, effective immediately. The intervention was a particularly swift example of a national corporation implementing its own LGBT nondiscrimination policies, even in a location where state law doesnt offer employees the same protections. Last week, Carter had called her boyfriend to celebrate her job offer, she said in an interview with KTRK, which first reported Carters allegations on Saturday. Im an active member of society again, she told her boyfriend. I was so happy. But when the manager called back within an hour, she said, He was like, My supervisor and I have a problem because on your license it says male, but youre and I was like, Im transgender. The manager rescinded the job offer, according to Carter, because the manager and his supervisors did not know which bathroom Carter should use. Some people were sharing the news on Twitter. By Tuesday morning, the corporate offices for the chicken chain were crowing at the manager and cooing for Carter. @elielcruz KFC will not tolerate discrimination. The franchisee terminated this manager & Ms Carter was offered a job at any Richmond KFC In the statement to BuzzFeed News, the company said, KFCs policy is to treat everyone fairly, equally and with respect, and we do not tolerate discrimination of any kind. Upon learning of this allegation, the franchisee who owns this Richmond restaurant conducted an immediate and thorough investigation. KTRK reported that the restaurant manager said he never offered Carter a job, only interviewed her. Spokespeople for KFC did not answer questions from BuzzFeed News about whether Carter had been officially offered a job or not. Carter could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday. Virginia lacks discrimination protections for private-sector LGBT employees. But in recent years, many top corporations in the U.S. have adopted nondiscrimination policies. Yum! Brands, the parent company of KFC, has an 80% score on the Human Rights Campaigns Corporate Equality Index, which gauges employers LGBT policies. While Yum! Brands gets high marks for an equality policy that includes gender identity, its score was reduced in the survey for lacking adequate competency training on LGBT issues and lacking transgender health care coverage. Additionally, KFCs statement concluded, the franchisee is emphasizing sensitivity and compliance with their policies to keep this from happening again. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Dozens of psychotherapists have called on Britains biggest professional body for therapists to acknowledge that trans people are subjected to attempts to cure them. View this image  Karen Pollock More than 80 leading counsellors and psychotherapists have signed an open letter urging Britains largest professional body for therapists to protect trans people from conversion therapy, BuzzFeed News can reveal. The letter, which was written by LGBT therapist Karen Pollock, calls on the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) to recognise that transgender people are subjected to conversion therapy, to condemn it, and to offer increased training for all therapists to ensure they respond ethically to trans clients. Currently, the BACP has only expressed opposition to conversion therapy the attempt by some therapists to cure LGBT people when carried out on lesbian, gay, and bisexual people. Last year the organisation, which has more than 30,000 members, signed up to a statement called the Memorandum of Understanding, which condemned such therapy but it left out trans people. Every major mental health body in Britain signed the memorandum. But in a recent interview by BuzzFeed News, Dominic Davies widely regarded as the leading expert on LGBT therapy in Britain revealed that he had resigned his fellowship of the BACP after discovering its governors were unlikely to sign an updated version of the statement that includes trans people. Davies said he was told by another senior member of the organisation that the governors probably will not sign the amended memorandum because they say theres no evidence of trans people or asexuals receiving conversion therapy. Prompted by the interview, Pollock composed the open letter to the BACP on Sunday and within 48 hours over 80 professionals from the fields of therapy and diversity had signed it. It begins: We, the undersigned, wish to express our deep unease with the attitude of the British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy to issues of gender and sexual diversity. In particular it is very worrying that after a year of consultation there seems to be no movement on adding protection from conversion/reparative therapy to trans people. Nor does it seem that the BACP appreciates fully the need for training to include an understanding of gender and sexual diversity. View this image  Karen Pollock The letter also details a succession of studies into the experiences of trans people when accessing psychotherapy and the problems they encounter with therapists as a result of their gender identity. These include a report by the Transgender Equality Network Northern Ireland that found that 40% of trans people were discouraged from seeking crisis support or counselling by previous experiences and Pollocks own research, which found that when suicidal, nearly a fifth of trans people are discouraged from seeking counselling due to a fear of a counsellor being transphobic. The letter continues: We call upon the BACP to send a clear message that in order to comply with the Ethical Framework [the therapists good-practice guide] members must not offer conversion therapy to trans people. This means that therapists must not attempt to enforce on trans clients the gender identity of the sex that was assigned at birth. It concludes: There seems no logical, or ethical reason to exclude trans people from the memorandum of understanding which the BACP signed in 2015 for LGB people. View this image  The Queerness / Karen Pollock The governors of the BACP will meet on 4 March to decide whether to sign the updated Memorandum of Understanding. View this image  Karen Pollock Karen Pollock Dominic Davies resignation was the catalyst for the letter, Pollock told BuzzFeed News. Hearing what he had to say in the interview confirmed a lot of concerns I had as a member of the LGBT community, that an awful lot of therapists I encounter have no knowledge or understanding of the LGBT community at all. Pollock, who is a member of the BACP, added: This was the story that broke the camels back. It was a culmination of feeling the BACP dont really care or understand, and this was something I was prepared to take a stand on because there is no argument. In her own research, Pollock said she encountered numerous trans people who have had terrible experiences with therapists who, even when not attempting to convert them, would misgender them for example, referring to a trans woman as he. The reaction to the letter from fellow therapists and members of the LGBT community was immediate and vast, she said. I literally just wrote it, put it in an open Google document, tweeted it twice and put it on the Pink Therapy [Dominic Davies practice] Facebook page, she said. People found it. This shows how strong the feeling is and how widespread. She did not have to email the letter to anyone before the responses started streaming in, she said. View this image  The Queerness / Karen Pollock The tone of the emails I got from people who wanted to sign was one of disappointment [towards the BACP] she said. The signatories are mostly therapists and counsellors, but from a variety of backgrounds. Its a broad range, said Pollock. Some of the therapists on there are cisgender [not trans] heterosexual therapists. She hopes that the governors will see the letter, the names of the experts who have signed it, and decide to sign up to the updated memorandum. It really is that straightforward, she said. The long-term goal would be better training, but short-term its like, Come on, this doesnt even need thought: Put the bloody T after the LGB please. In a statement to BuzzFeed News, the BACP said it was considering proposals to revise the current MoU. The BACP Board will discuss these proposals in March. We cant comment in any detail until then, nor pre-empt the Board decision. The statement continued: We understand that there is a debate about the evidence regarding conversion therapy and transgender issues. As an organisation that aims to make our policy and practice evidence-informed, the Board needs to consider this debate fully and carefully. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

Its not an anti-bullying program, Mr Abbott said. Its a social engineering program. Its funding should be terminated. The program, which has been running in Australian schools for four years, has been under fire from conservative politicians and religious activists. View this image  Hugh Peterswald / NEWZULU Forster says her brother is a man with a lot of empathy, but very little understanding of the innate nature of a persons sexuality or gender identity. Its my view that you cannot engineer a child into being transgender or homosexual. And its my experience. Its not something thats engineered. Its something thats inherent to a person, she told BuzzFeed News. Forster said shes disappointed by the language used by politicians who have been critical of the program. I dont think its helpful. Its negative and unconstructive, she said. Its because theyve never experienced it themselves. Anyone who has never experienced being gay or being transgender - I can see where theyd perhaps stuggled to get their head around it - But that is peoples reality. You cannot engineer people to be transgender. The Safe Schools program is doing good, necessary work, she said. Ive only heard anecdotally good things about the program.That its seeking to educate children about diversity and teach them about the very negative ramifications of bullying. Thats why I believe the program should continue to be funded. Hes been backed by LNP MP George Christensen, who has linked the program to child grooming, and Labor senator Joe Bullock, who called the program terrible. Some MPs and religious activists have claimed the program contains instructions for penis tucking and chest binding. It doesnt, but an organisation linked to the program does offer instructions for gender diverse children to do those things safely. View this image  AAP We must address it. No one committed suicide when I was a kid, because we could go home at three oclock, you get past the bully, you could get home and it was over. Now, the bullying can be 24 hours a day and anonymous, he told The Australian. I dont know any teacher who is going to sit down and talk about tucking or anything like that. What they will do, what teachers and school principals will do, will take the bits of it that are relevant to their schoolchildren and they will make sure that what theyre saying to their schoolchildren is good and make sure that its appropriate.

In HIV-negative people, however, studies have shown that taking it once per day can reduce the likelihood of contracting HIV by up to 92%. This method is called PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) and was formally approved by Health Canada on Feb. 23. The drug is intended for use by high risk individuals such as those whose sexual partner is HIV positive in combination with safer sex practises, including condom use, a Health Canada spokesperson told BuzzFeed Canada. View this image  Truvada is pricey, running anywhere from $800 to $1,200 per month when used daily, although Quebecs drug plan does provide coverage Sean Hosein, the Science and Medicine Editor at CATIE, told BuzzFeed Canada last year that some private insurers may have been wary of covering PrEP without official approval. Health Canadas decision could potentially change that. Hosein also said having Health Canadas blessing means more doctors may feel comfortable prescribing it to patients.

aS"Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah travels to James Baldwins home in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France, and examines the impact of a writer whose legacy cannot be erased. It was an acquaintances idea to go there, to James Baldwins house. He knew from living in Paris that Baldwins old place, the house where he died, was near an elegant, renowned hotel in the Cote DAzur region of France. He said both places were situated in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, a medieval-era walled village that was scenic enough to warrant the visit. He said we could go to Baldwins house and then walk up the road for drinks at the hotel bar where the writer used to drink in the evening. He said we would make a day of it, that I wouldnt regret it. For the first time in my life I was earning a bit of money from my writing, and since I was in London anyway for work and family obligations I decided to take the train over to Nice to meet him. But I remained apprehensive. Having even a tiny bit of disposable cash was very new and bizarre to me. It had been years since I had I bought myself truly new clothes, years since going to a cash machine to check my balance hadnt warranted a sense of impending doom, and years since I hadnt on occasion regretted even going to college, because it was increasingly evident that I would never be able to pay back my loans. There were many nights where I lay awake turning over in my mind the inevitable that soon Sallie Mae or some faceless, cruel moneylender with a blues songtype name would take my mothers home (she had co-signed for me) and thus render my family homeless. In my mind, three generations of progress would be undone by my vain commitment to tell stories about black people in a country where the black narrative was a quixotic notion at best. If I knew anything about being black in America it was that nothing was guaranteed, you couldnt count on anything, and all that was certain for most of us was a black death. In my mind, a black death was a slow death, the accumulation of insults, injuries, neglect, second-rate health care, high blood pressure, and stress, no time for self-care, no time to sigh, and, in the end, the inevitable, the erasing of memory. I wanted to write against this, and so I was writing a history of the people I did not want to forget. And I loved it; nothing else mattered, because I was remembering, I was staving off death. So I was in London when a check with four digits and one comma hit my account. It wasnt much but to me it seemed enormous. I decided if I was going to spend any money, something I was reluctant, if not petrified, to do, at the very least I would feel best about spending it on James Baldwin. After all, my connection to him was an unspoken hoodoo-ish belief that he had been the high priest in charge of my prayer of being a black person who wanted to exist on books and words alone. It was a deification that was fostered years before during a publishing internship at a magazine. During the lonely week I had spent in the storeroom of the magazines editorial office organizing the archives from 1870 to 2005, I had found time to pray intensely at the altar of Baldwin. I had asked him to grant me endurance and enough fight so that I could exit that storeroom with my confidence intact. I told him what all writers chant to keep on, that I had a story to tell. But later, away from all of that, I quietly felt repelled by him as if he were a home I had to leave to become my own. Instead, I spent years immersing myself in the books of Sergei Dovlatov, Vivian Gornick, Henry Dumas, Sei Shogonan, Madeline LEngle, and Octavia Butler. Baldwin didnt need my prayers he had the praise of the entire world. View this image  James Baldwin in Paris, October 1975. Sophie Bassouls / Corbis I still liked Baldwin but in a divested way, the way that anyone who writes and aspires to write well does. When people asked me my opinion on him I told them the truth: that Baldwin had set the stage for every American essayist who came after him with his 1955 essay collection Notes of a Native Son. One didnt need to worship him, or desire to emulate him, to know this and respect him for it. And yet, for me, there had always been something slightly off-putting about him the strangely accented, ponderous way he spoke in the interviews I watched; the lofty, theatrical way in which he appeared in Good Citizens, an essay by Joan Didion, as the bored, above-it-all figure that white people revered because he could stay collected. What I resented about Baldwin wasnt even his fault. I didnt like the way many men who only cared about Ali, Coltrane, and Obama praised him as the black authorial exception. I didnt like how every essay about race cited him. How they felt comfortable, as he described it, talking to him (and about him) absolutely bathed in a bubble bath of self-congratulation. James Baldwin and my grandfather were four years apart in age, but Baldwin, as he was taught to me, had escaped to France and avoided his birth-righted fate, whereas millions of black men his age had not. It seemed easy enough to fly in from France to protest and march, whereas it seemed straight hellish to live in the States with no ticket out. It seemed to me that Baldwin had written himself into the world and I wasnt sure what that meant in terms of his allegiances to our interiors as an everyday, unglamorous slog. So even now I have no idea why I went. Why I took that high-speed train past the sheep farms and the French countryside, past the brick villages and stone aqueducts, until the green hills faded and grew into Marseilles tall, dusky pink apartments and the bucolic steppes gave way to blue water where yachts and topless women with leather for skin were parked on the beaches. It was on that train that I had time to consider the first time Baldwin had loomed large for me. It had occurred 10 years earlier, when I was accepted as an intern at one of the oldest magazines in the country. I had found out about the magazine only a few months before. A friend who let me borrow an issue made my introduction, but only after he spent almost 20 minutes questioning the quality of my high school education. How could I have never heard of such an influential magazine? I got rid of the friend and kept his copy. During my train ride into Manhattan on my first day, I kept telling myself that I really had no reason to be nervous; after all, I had proven my capability not just once but twice. Because the internship was unpaid I had to decline my initial acceptance to instead take a summer job and then reapplied later. When I arrived at the magazines offices, the first thing I noticed was the stark futuristic whiteness. The entire place was a brilliant white, except for the tight, gray carpeting. The senior and associate editors offices had sliding glass doors and the rest of the floor was divided into white-walled cubicles for the assistant editors and interns. The windows in the office looked out over the city, and through the filmy morning haze I could see the cobalt blue of one of the citys bridges and the water tanks that spotted some of the citys roofs. The setting, the height, and the spectacular view were not lost on me. I had never before had any real business in a skyscraper. Each intern group consisted of four people; my group also included a recent Brown grad, a hippie-ish food writer from the West Coast, and a dapper Ivy League sort of mixed-race Southeast Asian descent. We spent the first part of the day learning our duties, which included finding statistics, assisting the editors with the magazines features, fact-checking, and reading submissions. Throughout the day various editors stopped by and made introductions. Sometime after lunch the office manager came into our cubicle and told us she was cleaning out the communal fridge and that we were welcome to grab whatever was in it. Eager to scavenge a free midday snack, we decided to take her up on the offer. As we walked down the hall the Princeton grad joked that because he and I were the only brown folks around we should be careful about taking any food because they might say we were looting. I had forgotten about Hurricane Katrina, the tragedy of that week, during the days bustle, and somehow I had also allowed the fact that I am black to fade to the back of my thoughts, behind my stress and excitement. It was then that I was smacked with the realization that the walls werent the only unusually white entities in the office the editorial staff was strangely all white as well. Because we were interns, neophytes, we spent the first week getting acquainted with each other and the inner workings of the magazine. Sometime towards the end of my first week, a chatty senior editor approached me in the corridor. During the course of our conversation I was informed that I was (almost certainly) the first black person to ever intern at the magazine and that there had never been any black editors. I laughed it off awkwardly only because I had no idea of what to say. I was too shocked. At the time of my internship the magazine was more than 150 years old. It was a real Guess Whos Coming to Dinner moment. Except that I, being a child of the 80s, had never watched the film in its entirety, I just knew it starred Sidney Poitier as a young, educated black man who goes to meet his white wifes parents in the 1960s. When my conversation with the talkative editor ended I walked back to my desk and decided to just forget about it. Besides, I reasoned, it was very possible that the editor was just absent-minded. I tried to forget it myself but I could not, and finally I casually asked another editor if it was true. He told me he thought there had been an Algerian-Italian girl many years ago, but he was not certain if she really counted as black. When I asked how that could be possible, I was told that the lack of diversity was due to the lack of applications from people of color. As awkward as these comments were, they were made in the spirit of oblivious commonwealth. It was office chatter meant to make me feel like one of the gang, but instead of comforting my concerns it made me feel like an absolute oddity. On good days, being the first black intern meant doing my work quickly and sounding extra witty around the water cooler; it meant I was chipping away at the glass ceiling that seemed to top most of the literary world. But on bad days I gagged on my resentment and furiously wondered why I was selected. I became paranoid that I was merely a product of affirmative action, even though I knew wasnt. I hadnt mentioned my race in either of my two accepted applications. Still, I never felt like I was actually good enough. And with my family and friends so proud of me, I felt like I could not burst their bubble with my insecurity and trepidation. So when I was the only intern asked by a top editor to do physical labor and reorganize all of the old copies of the magazine in the freezing, dusty storeroom, I fretted in private. Was I asked because of my race or because that was merely one of my duties as the intern-at-large? There was no way to tell. I found myself most at ease with the other interns and the staff that did not work on the editorial side of the magazine: the security guards, the delivery guys, the office manager, and the folks at the front desk. Within them the United Nations was almost represented. With them, I did not have to worry that one word pronounced wrong or one reference not known would reflect not just poorly on me but also on any black person who might apply after me. I also didnt have to worry about that in that storeroom. I vexingly realized three things spending a week in the back of that dismal room. That yes, I was the only intern asked to do manual labor, but I was surrounded by 150 years of the greatest American essays ever written, so I read them cover to cover. And I discovered that besides the physical archives and magazines stored there, the storeroom was also home to the old index card invoices that its writers used to file. In between my filing duties, I spent time searching those cards, and the one that was most precious to me was Baldwins. In 1965, he was paid $350 for an essay that is now legend. The check went to his agents office. There was nothing particularly spectacular about the faintly yellowed card except that its routineness suggested a kind of normalcy. It looped a great man back to the earth for me. And in that moment, Baldwins eminence was a gift. He had made it out of the storeroom. He had taken a steamer away from being driven mad from maltreatment. His excellence had moved him beyond the realm of physical labor. He had disentangled himself from being treated like someone who was worth-less or questioning his worth. And better yet, Baldwin was so good they wanted to preserve his memory. Baldwin joined the pantheon of black people who were from that instructional generation of civil rights fighters, and I would look at that card every day of my week down there. What makes us want to run away? Or go searching for a life away from ours? The term black refugees applies most specifically to the black American men and women who escaped in 1812 to the British navys boats and were later taken to freedom in Nova Scotia and Trinidad, but dont many of us feel like black refugees. Baldwin called these feelings, the sense of displacement and loss that many Black Americans ponder, the heavy questions, and heavy they are indeed. Sometime in early 50s, after being roughed up and harassed by the FBI, James Baldwin realized that while he loved his country, he could not respect it. He wrote that he could not, upon my soul, be reconciled to my country as it was. To survive he would have to find an exit. On the train to Baldwins house I thought more about that earlier generation and about the seemingly vast divide between Baldwin and my grandfather. They had very little in common, except they were of the same era, the same race, and were both fearless men, which in black America actually says a lot. Whereas Baldwin spent his life writing against a canon, writing himself into the canon, a black man recording the Homeric legend of his life himself, my grandfather simply wanted to live with dignity. It must have been hard then to die the way my grandfather did. I imagine it is not the ending that he expected when he left Louisiana and moved to Watts to a small, white house near 99th Street and Success Avenue. After his death, I went back to the house in Watts that he had been forced to return to, broke and burned out of his home, and gathered what almost 90 years of black life in America had amounted to for him: a notice saying that his insurance claim from the fire had been denied, two glazed clay bowls, and his hammer (he was a carpenter). My grandfather had worked hard but had made next to nothing. I took a picture of the wall that my grandfather built during his first month in LA. It was old, cracked, jagged, not pretty at all, but at the time, it was the best evidence I had that my grandfather had ever been here. And as I scattered his ashes near the Hollywood Park racetrack, because he loved horses and had always remained a country boy at heart, I realized that the dust in my hands was the entirety of my inheritance from him. And until recently, I used to carry that memory and his demand for optimism around like an amulet divested of its power, because I had no idea what to do with it. What Baldwin understood, and my grandfather preferred not to focus on, is that to be black in America is to have the demand for dignity be at absolute odds with the national anthem. From the outside, Baldwins house looks ethereal. The saltwater air from the Mediterranean acts like a delicate scrim over the heat and the horizon, and the dry, craggy yard is wide and long and tall with cypress trees. I had prepared for the day by watching clips of him in his gardens. I read about the medieval frescos that had once lined the dining room. I imagined the dinners he had hosted for Josephine Baker and Beauford Delaney under a trellis of creeping vines and grape arbors. I imagined a house full of books and life. Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah Scenes from James Baldwins home in the south of France. I fell in love with Baldwin all over again in France. There I found out that Baldwin didnt go to France because he was full of nave, empty admiration for Europe; as he once said in an interview: If I were twenty-four now, I dont know if and where I would go. I dont know if I would go to France, I might go to Africa. You must remember when I was twenty-four there was really no Africa to go to, except Liberia. Now, though, a kid now well, you see, something has happened which no one has really noticed, but its very important: Europe is no longer a frame of reference, a standard-bearer, the classic model for literature and for civilization. Its not the measuring stick. There are other standards in the world. Baldwin left the States for the primary reason that all emigrants do because anywhere seems better than home. This freedom-seeking gay man, who deeply loved his sisters and brothers biological and metaphorical never left them at all. In France, I saw that Baldwin didnt live the life of a wealthy man, but he did live the life of man who wanted to travel, to erect an estate of his own design, and write as an outsider, alone in silence. He had preserved himself. Decades after Baldwins death in 1987, what I found left behind in his house was something similar to what I saw as we waded through my grandfathers house after it had burned down. In both houses, I found mail strewn in dirt piles in rooms that no longer had doors or windowpanes, and entryways nailed over to prevent trespassers like us. In each case, someone had clearly forced entry in order to drink beer. In Baldwins house, the scattered, empty beer cans were recent additions, as were the construction postings from a company tasked with tearing it down. So that nothing would remain. No remembrance of the past. In both places there was not even the sense that a great man had once lived there. James Baldwin lived in his house for more than 25 years, and all that was left were half a dozen pink teacups and turquoise saucers buried by the houses rear wall, a chipped fresco on a crumbling wall, and orange trees that were heavy with fruit bitter and sharp to the taste. We see Baldwins name in connection to the present condition more often than we see Faulkners, Whitmans, or Thoreaus. But we can visit the houses and places where they lived and imagine how their geography shaped them and our collective vocabulary. By next year, Baldwins house will just be another private memory for those who knew it. I do not know if I will ever see his house again. If I will be able to pull sour oranges from his trees and wonder if they were so bitter when he lived there. But I do know that Baldwin died a black death. For a while when I came back to the States, I started to send strange, desperate emails to people who knew him that read: For the last two days, Ive basically found myself frantically, maniacally looking for everything that I could find about Baldwins life there. To be honest, Im not at all sure what I am looking for, but when I walked up that steep little hill, past the orange and cypress trees out onto the main road, and looked back at his house I just felt a compulsion to start asking people who knew him about his life in that house. The compound is almost gone, as they are in the process of demolishing it and yet something about it and him seemed to still be very much there. Baldwin once wrote, Life is tragic simply because the earth turns and the sun inexorably rises and sets, and one day, for each of us, the sun will go down for the last, last time. Perhaps the whole root of our trouble, the human trouble, is that we will sacrifice all the beauty of our lives, will imprison ourselves in totems, taboos, crosses, blood sacrifices, steeples, mosques, races, armies, flags, nations, in order to deny the fact of death, the only fact we have. It seems to me that one ought to rejoice in the fact of deathought to decide, indeed, to earn ones death by confronting with passion the conundrum of life. One is responsible for life: It is the small beacon in that terrifying darkness from which we come and to which we shall return. I sent those notes feeling as hopeless as I sounded because I wanted to save that building. I did not want it and him to vanish into the terrifying darkness. Because I was scared that no one else would ever be able to see that Baldwin had a rainbow kitchen an orange sink and purple shelves in his guesthouse. I wanted someone else to wonder what he ate from this kitchen, who stayed in this annex of his estate, who he loved, whether his love felt free in this kitchen, in this house where two men could embrace in private behind the ramparts of his home in another country. I wanted someone else to understand the private black language found in one of Baldwins last conversations with his brother David. Frail, sick, and being carried to his deathbed in his brothers arms, what the world thought of him might as well have been an ocean away. In that moment, Baldwin didnt refer to French poets, or to the cathedrals of his genius, he instead returned to a popular song. He loved music, and he told his brother: So it is true what they say he is my brother and hes not heavy. There is no great mystery behind why Baldwins house isnt treated like Anna and Sigmund Freuds in London or rebuilt and replicated like Dante Alighieris in Florence. We lost the house because supposedly there was no way to prove that it was his, his niece Kali-Ma Morrison tells me with a slight edge in her voice. People contested his right to ownership in the French Supreme Court and after 10 years of fighting to save it, we lost. For months, I had wanted to know about the women who read as almost mythical in Baldwins life and work, the siblings and nieces who are tasked with being the legal keepers of his legacy. I was also curious because in the strange early hours of the morning just before the bakeries open and the fog lifts herself from the mountains, I sat in a village in the South of France and watched Baldwin defend our future as black women on The Dick Cavett Show in 1968. My god, how I loved his exasperation and anger as he told primetime television, I dont know if the real estate lobby has anything against black people, but I know that the real estate lobby is keeping me in the ghetto. I dont know if the board of education hates black people, but I know the textbooks they give my children to read and the schools that we have to go to. Now: This is the evidence. And you want me to make an act of faith risking myself, my life, my woman, my sister, my children on some idealism which you assure me exists in America which I have never seen? In 1968, James Baldwin was already asking, What is any movement without all of us? What is a black conversation that divides our concerns? Kali-Ma Baldwins niece is in her late twenties. She is a visual artist and poet, and although she has piercings and tattoos, she looks like the sort of young woman who once appeared in tintype photographs patient, timeless, and very beautiful in an intoxicatingly demure way. Her grandmother Gloria is Baldwins sister, and handles her brothers estate. Her other grandmother is Toni Morrison. Kali-Ma hands me a cup of green tea, reaches down to stroke her purring cat, who has been clawing her ankles for attention, and then goes over to a bookcase that sags with books and pulls out some of her uncles belongings that she retrieved from Saint-Paul-de-Vence. She hands me a faded copy of his book A Dialogue (written with with Nikki Giovanni), his copies of Freedomways magazine (including one with Lorraine Hansberry on the cover), and a small brass plaque (engraved in French) awarded to him for his commitment to human rights. We are both very quiet. I trace the Greek severe-style angel on the award with my finger until she shrugs and says, I know I should probably have this stuff locked away, or covered in laminate, but I like him out here, you know, being here with me and mixed in with the other books. Alive. I came to her place to take a picture of Baldwins typewriter. This is what I told her. But I think I also came because I wanted to see someone who is his flesh and blood. I wanted to see that he was really theirs, their Uncle Jimmy. Because if he was theirs, the logic followed, then he was also ours. Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah Baldwin artifacts Baldwins people have an old-world, sophisticated manner. They offer you three types of tea, whiskey, and their time. Theyre patient and generous. They never ask me what Im doing there. They are tolerant of my desire to find the quiet bibliography that he left behind in the small notations, brushes, and ephemera of his life. Annotations I believed when taken together would tell a private story of his battles and alienations as a gay black man who was born into poverty as the eldest in a solar system of siblings (there were nine of them), but who was also singularly rich, with an agile mind, a louche, lithe body, and a long-eyed gaze. In the 21st century, black history must shirk any oversimplification. What I unfortunately realized late in the game was that I had allowed myself to understand Baldwin through a series of abstractions, one that was principally based upon how strangers, outsiders, and gatekeepers had interpreted his life. In their telling, I had never heard how Baldwin had felt like he could make peace with his old friend Richard Wright, but it would take a big bottle of booze and a whole night of talking in that garden in Saint-Paul. They never told me just how much Baldwin loved his records spirituals and Bessie Smith. Or how he had met with Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy to press the government about its callous response to the civil rights movement. No one had ever told me to study with care the Harlem in the way that he could keep a cigarette dangling from his lips, just so, balanced between a Bloods deep blues and a 125th Street cool. The American triumphin which the American tragedy has always been implicitwas to make Black people despise themselves, Baldwin wrote in a forward to Angela Daviss book If They Come in the Morning. He signed the letter Brother Jimmy and addressed Angela Davis as Sister Angela. When I was younger, the way Baldwin explained the conditions of Negroes to others made me question his devotion, but as I held his copy of Daviss book in my hands and re-read those words, it was evident that America had never triumphed over James Baldwin. One afternoon, Trevor Baldwin, Wilmer Lover Baldwins son (the younger brother of the nephew addressed in Baldwins Letter to My Nephew), tells me about Uncle Jimmys visits back to the States, when he would return to the house that he had purchased for his mother on 71st Street. Trevor is a down-to-earth, forthright Morehouse man, a Harlem man, and he recalls what both he and his father admired most about Uncle Jimmy. He walked with a certain sense of manhood, Trevor told me. You could easily see he was gay but [he] walked with his chest out and hed cut you with his tongue. Which is to say he had self-pride? I asked. Yes! Trevor said. He had to move to Europe because he was seriously worried that he was going to kill somebody. Trevor always knew that Uncle Jimmy was in town because suddenly his grandmothers house would swell with visitors. Uncle Jimmy, he laughed, brought everybody to her, Maya (Angelou) included, and Toni, and said, Heres something else you dont need, but I got another sister. You got another child. He was the man of the house. He was the patriarch of us all. I like this image of Baldwin, it is both vanguard and conventional, but I also enjoy the way Kali-Ma shudders when I ask her if her uncle was a patriarch. Of his sisters? His mother? No, she says. She looks for a word to describe what he was. I try to help. We are both writers, but we could not find a single word to describe this man who told his adopted sisters that they had to write down their stories and later pragmatically assisted them in their endeavors, who had best friends in many countries in all professions, and who taught his older brother and young nephews a rare, lasting lesson in bravery that we must be brilliant and big enough to be ourselves. To have pink teacups and brown typewriters. Baldwin defined what made him a great writer on his own terms. He also ensured that his success was not dependent on his silences. He taught us all that the greatest black art demands that there be no rejection of life, the human being, the denial of his beauty or our power. Some people will consider this vain, but isnt this what all good warriors have always done: venerating, salvaging, and celebrating ourselves in between battles? Is this not our real inheritance? I have spent months thinking about something his former agents granddaughter Eliza Mills revealed to me after she found out that I had been to his home in France. James Baldwin used to play dodgeball with my dad and his friends. And hed stay up and out all night and go to bed when my dad and his sister were going to school in the morning. My grandfather helped sell a couple of his books and would read/edit things. I think he was writing The Fire Next Time while he lived there. Ive seen a note or two that he wrote to my grandfather in the books he left at their house. Breathless at the idea of all of this, I asked her if she was for real or kidding me. View this image  Baldwins typewriter Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah Yeah, she replied, incredulous to my doubt. One little inscription is written in rainbow ink and half in French. Last week, when I got back from seeing his brown typewriter, I wrote down the word joy and underlined it three times, like it was an obligation, a chore, something that I would have to find, if not fight for. I did this because isnt the more intimate, tenebrous story the one where we recognize each other not only in our despair but also in our joy? In your rainbow ink and your sleeplessness nights, in your demands and, in your nieces and nephews who love you like a black god. I will find you in the enthusiasms of our peoples style, our verve and our wit, the way you slouched in your seat and crossed your legs, in the ways that they will misunderstand you but we will always know you, in the abridgments that we will make to history, changing it forever. Because I am telling this now, writing it all down, I am finding time to regard memory and death differently. Im holding them up in the light and searching them, inspecting them, as they are not as what I want them to be. On that hill, in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, I wanted to alter fate, and preserve things. But why? He did not need me Baldwin seemed to have prepared himself well for his black death, his mortality, and even better, his immortality. Indeed, he bested all of them, because he wrote it all down both on the page and in his beautiful gestures. And this is how his memory abides. On the scent of wild lavender like the kind in his yard, in the mouths of a new generation that once again feels compelled to march in the streets of Harlem, Ferguson, and Baltimore. What Baldwin knew is that he left no false heirs, he left spares, and that is why we carry him with us. So now when people ask me about James Baldwin, I tell them another truth: He is my brother, he aint heavy.  View this image  James Baldwin in New York City on May 31, 1974.

aS"Turns out bridesmaids arent the only ones shelling out big bucks. View this image  View this image  Well, kind of. The time and money drain on bridesmaids is well documented. And while no, guys dont usually have to go to a bridal shower (although, ahem, they should), and hair and makeup costs are virtually nonexistent, theres certainly more to being a groomsman than picking up a rental tux and throwing dollar bills at strippers at the bachelor party. To get to the bottom of it, we asked men tell us much they spent, how it broke down, and how they felt about it. The lowest amount we got was $160 and the highest was $2,960 and from the 22 responses, its clear that men in weddings have it no easier women. Here are some of their stories Age: 23 Wedding location and date: August 2013 in Atlanta Relationship with the groom: High school best friend How much did you spend on the suit or tux? We rented out suits, but opted to wear jackets instead of vests. This kept the cost of the whole rental around $95. The groom actually bought us a pair of white high top Converses to wear as a gift and the best man bought the ties for us the day of the wedding. Somehow, they matched the girls dresses perfectly. How much did you spend on the bachelor party? $70. Due to time constraints, this consisted of drinking and playing video games all night at the best mans house. All I did was buy the alcohol and order pizza. How much did you spend on travel for wedding? None the venue was local. Did you give a gift? In lieu of a gift, I paid for their hotel room the night of the wedding. It probably cost around $130. How did the groom and/or his family help keep costs down? His family worked tirelessly to try and keep costs down. Her parents were insistent on paying only for certain pieces and not the whole day, so we arranged the majority of the decorations and his extended family provided a lot of the food/alcohol. Any final thoughts? I was very excited to be a part of his wedding. He is in active service and was only home for he week before so there was a lot of work done in those seven days. I felt that the cost of being in this wedding was fairly low compared to others that Ive been in. We really cut out all of the frivolous expenses and still had an incredible time. Im planning my own wedding now, and as much I love idea of fun/unique groomsmen gifts, Ill probably just help pay for a lot of the things that Im asking them to wear that day, such as a tie or shoes. Age: 30 Wedding location and date: September 2013 in Tarrytown, New York Relationship with the groom: Middle/high school friend How much did you spend on the suit or tux? The suit rental was like $200 or so? I did not choose it, it was a horrible, oversized rental from Mens Warehouse. Or Wearhouse. I forget if they go for the pun or not. They measure you and then promptly give you a suit five times too big. I went to pick it up and the pants were literally falling off me. I had to complain and get them to change the size, and after that, the suit was only two times too big. How much did you spend on the bachelor party? The bachelor party was in Atlantic City. Id say it was about $450500. We stayed in some run-down hotel that was still insanely expensive. The best man didnt book it until, like, three minutes before we were supposed to be there, and it was summer, so we got plowed on the price. I shared a room with two dudes and a bed with one. The rest of the money was partially spent on strip clubs, obviously. I hate strip clubs, but the best man did not, so that was joyful. We also went to a steakhouse, of course because we are men and must make sure our colons wont make it past age 50 without getting cancery. I got chicken because I love my colon and it was still insanely expensive. It was nice of some people to order Scotch and then divide up the tab. Travel was pretty cheap. I drove down with a friend, so those expenses were just gas/tolls/snacks. How much did you spend on travel for wedding? Travel to the wedding was cheap it was just a few towns over from where I lived. Did you give a gift? I did; it was a check because no one actually wants a present. Anyone who pretends they have a registry is just doing it because they want cash but are too scared to be perceived as being money-hungry. I think I gave $150? How did the groom and/or his family help keep costs down? File not found. Any final thoughts? It was too much to spend on a tangential friend. I felt sorta blindsided when he asked me. We werent very close, but he called me up and asked me and I said yes. If it had been email or text, I mightve said no, given that we werent close and weddings are intolerable. This guy had the most generic wedding with the most insipid hired-gun officiant and we all had to act like it was Disney magic. View this image  Age: 37 Wedding location and date: December 2007 in New York City Relationship with the groom: Ex-boyfriend How much did you spend on the suit or tux? It was a rental. I showed up to the rental shop, they told me which one the groom had chosen, they measured me, and I paid. I picked it up the day before the wedding and I returned it after the wedding. It was about $200 to rent it, including shoes and socks. How much did you spend on the bachelor party? I spent about $330 on the bachelor party weekend. The bachelor party was in Houston, about four hours from where I live, so at least I didnt have to spend money on airfare. I spent about $60 in gas to drive to Houston. It was another $120 for my hotel room for one night (I didnt want to have to share with any of the other guys they were all straight). I spent $20 on a brewery tour (I dont even drink beer). I spent about $50 at dinner. The guys then wanted to go to a strip club. Being gay, I had no interest, but went along anyway. The club sent over a bunch of girls to our table. I told the girl assigned to me that I was gay right at the beginning of the night. I gave her $50 and we just ended up talking the whole night. All of the other guys got wasted, so I was the designated driver back to the hotel. After tucking all of them in, it was still early. So I decided to go out to a gay bar in Houston. One of the other groomsman said he wanted to tag along, for the experience. I was a little taken aback, but I agreed to let him come. We went out, danced, and had fun. I only spent about $30 for drinks and cover at the bar. The next morning, the guys went golfing, but I decided to skip out and drive back home. How much did you spend on travel for wedding? The total wedding weekend cost me about $1,100. It was $450 for the flight from Dallas to New York. I spent another $300 for two hotel nights. I spent about $150 on cabs/subway over the course of the weekend. Food and drinks were included at the rehearsal dinner and wedding. I spent about $200 on other meals/drinks. Did you give a gift? I gave them a gift for their kitchen off their registry. I dont even remember what it was, but I spent $100 on it. How did the groom and/or his family help keep costs down? I was never asked for my input, but I knew I would be able to afford it, so it wasnt really a concern of mine. The other groomsmen lived in New York, so they didnt have to pay for airfare like I did. But the grooms family paid for the rehearsal dinner and drinks. They also rented a shuttle on the day of the wedding to transport the groomsmen to and from the hotel and wedding venue. Also, our groomsmen gifts were personalized cuff links. We wore them in the wedding and I have worn them many times since. Any final thoughts? It felt really strange. He and I had dated for several years in college. We remained friends after we broke up, but it hadnt worked out between us because he was bisexual and ultimately wanted to end up with a woman. As far as I know, his bride doesnt know he and I were an item before he met her. She just thinks Im his token gay friend. I really debated about agreeing to be in his wedding, because at the time, I wasnt over him yet. Its definitely more challenging to be in a wedding in an expensive city like New York, but luckily, I was able to afford it. I was glad the bachelor party was close enough to home to avoid airfare. This was my fifth time being a groomsman, so I sort of already knew the protocol, that there would be substantial expense being in an out-of-town wedding. I also knew what I was willing to put up with (strip club) and not put up with (6 a.m. tee time), planned accordingly, and set expectations with the other groomsmen. Most guys dont understand that being in a wedding party is a commitment. You are expected to spend money. You are expected to show up on time. And all without complaint. I agreed, so I did everything asked of me without complaining. Age: 37 Wedding location and date: November 2009 in Kansas City Relationship with the groom: Former roommates How much did you spend on the suit or tux? We wore traditional black rental tuxedos. I spent $40, the groom spent $50. Like every rental tux, it wasnt tailored well and didnt fit at all. The jacket fit my shoulders, which left a billowing excess of fabric around my stomach. The pants rode up so high that by the end of the photo session they were two inches above my shoes. We still love making fun of those pictures. How much did you spend on the bachelor party? I was unemployed in the summer before the wedding, so I planned a CHEAP bachelor party, and everyone had a blast. The theme was whiskey, red meat, and electric guitars. We met for drinks, then walked to a steakhouse. After dinner we saw three bands wed never heard of at a great venue, had a few drinks, and then half the party took cabs home and the other half crashed at my house. The cost was under $100 per person. Maybe a little more if you count the greasy diner breakfast in the morning. How much did you spend on travel for wedding? Nothing. Did you give a gift? No. I was teaching part time when they got married, but I designed their invitations and helped build centerpieces. How did the groom and/or his family help keep costs down? In lieu of buying a groomsman gift, the groom paid the first $50 of my tuxedo rental fee. It was much better than the typical engraved flask that will never be used again or disposable technology gadget. Any final thoughts? I think groomsmen have it easier than bridesmaids because the cultural expectations are more reasonable. Groomsmen are not supposed to be backup dancers or clones or servants. They are just men in their best clothes, standing up to support a friend as he begins a new chapter in his life. View this image  Age: 29 Wedding location and date: May 2009 in Oxford, Ohio Relationship with the groom: Cousin How much did you spend on the suit or tux? The groom selected a basic tux for all the groomsmen to wear. It was around $150 for the rental, and the retailer was a large national chain, so it was pretty easy to go get measured and then pick up the tux. I felt weird at the time wearing rented clothing, but looking back at the photos, everyone looked really nice. And I never would have been able to afford to buy a tux or even a suit at the time, so renting was definitely the most cost-effective option. How much did you spend on the bachelor party? We stayed in Chicago (where I live) for the bachelor party, so there were no travel expenses other than a few cab rides, which probably amounted to more than $25 per person. We went out for a really nice steak dinner, which cost way more than I could typically afford to spend on dinner back then: around $100 a piece for food and drinks. From there we went to a few different strip joints. As the only gay guy at the party, I wasnt shelling out any money for lap dances, but since most of those places have a drink minimum, I probably spent another $75 at strip clubs. No regrets; it was certainly entertaining! How much did you spend on travel for wedding? My boyfriend and I caught a ride with another one of my cousins (who was also a groomsman in the wedding) and his wife. The town where the wedding took place was fairly small, so the hotel where we stayed for two nights was modest and not too expensive. I spent about $150 for the hotel. Did you give a gift? I didnt get them anything on my own (again, I was young and really broke), but Im sure my parents signed my name on the card for whatever they gifted the bride and groom. The wedding was really important to my father, because his older brother, the father of the groom, had died after a long illness a few years before the wedding. Im guessing he went big on the gift/cash that he gave to the newlyweds. How did the groom and/or his family help keep costs down? My cousin and his bride are pretty chill, so it was a modestly elegant affair. I think the bride and her family took care of most of the planning (since both the ceremony and reception took place on her family farm). And my cousin gave all the groomsmen a really nice thank-you gift: a monogrammed pocket knife, compass, and flashlight set, all of which Ive used for camping in the years since. Any final thoughts? I come from a tight-knit family and have a great relationship with all of my cousins, so I was really happy to be a part of this particular wedding. Im really fortunate to have the family that I do! I have only fond memories of the whole experience no drama, just a good time had by all. I spent more than I could really afford at that point in my life, but I didnt bring it up since I really wanted to be a part of it. It was very important to the couple to be surrounded by friends and family, and I think if at any point I had said I wasnt able to afford some component of it, someone in the family wouldve stepped in to help me out. Age: 37 Wedding location and date: September 2015 in Michigan Relationship with the groom: Friends since elementary school How much did you spend on the suit or tux? We had to rent tuxes for about $185. For that price, I would have rather bought a suit that I could have kept. They were nice looking tuxes, though. How much did you spend on the bachelor party? The bachelor party was in our hometown, about five hours from St. Louis. I stayed with my parents so the only travel expense was $80 in gas. We rented a 12-passenger van for $15 each and drove it around all day. We went golfing, to the casino, out to eat, three different bars, and a strip club. I think I spent around $300. How much did you spend on travel for wedding? The drive was eight hours each way, plus a lot of driving from town to town for various events. I spent about $250 on gas. The hotel was $400 for three nights. Plus, we made various stops for food Did you give a gift? My wife bought them a $50 statue keepsake thing. How did the groom and/or his family help keep costs down? The family provided a rehearsal dinner and the groom gave all the groomsmen really nice gift bags with our favorite booze, personalized mugs, cigars, and a gift card. Any final thoughts? He was in my wedding and I knew I would be in his. Weve been brothers from other mothers for 25 years. He also gave us plenty of advance notice about everything, so that helped. The cost of the wedding meant that my wife and I had to cancel our plans for our anniversary trip, but it was worth it for a great friend who is really more like family. View this image  Age: 23 Wedding location and date: December 2014 in San Antonio Relationship with the groom: High school friend How much did you spend on the suit or tux? We were told to wear black suits, which I didnt own, so I spent $25 on the suit. I found a deal on eBay! Then another $25 on getting a hole patched up on the shoulder. I havent worn it again and I sold it on eBay after the wedding. How much did you spend on the bachelor party? I spent $100 on the bachelor party. We went shotgun shooting, then went to some shitty BBQ joint. Then, after everyone passed out for the night, me, the groom, and another groomsmen went to a karaoke bar. It was an awful experience overall, because for half the day, I was jammed in a Honda Civic with four other huge dudes because the guy in charge didnt want to take two cars. How much did you spend on travel for wedding? The flight was $500. The brides family lived in town so I was able to take a couch for a few days to keep my expenses cheap. Food was about $100 for the few days. Did you give a gift? I spent $100 on the gift, which was knifes, a food processor, and a Slapchop cutter. Any final thoughts? I actually wasnt allowed into the ceremony; I was invited because the bride had way more bridesmaids than the groom had groomsmen so my sole purpose was to be there for the reception and pictures so all the bridesmaids had a date. So I basically dropped close to $1,000 to pay for my drinks, have to talk to a girl who had a boyfriend for a half hour, and get my photo taken with a group. The wedding wasnt open bar so I ran up a tab of about $50 at the reception. Interviews have been lightly edited for length and clarity. *Names have been changed.

aS"In his first appearance at an LGBT community event, swimming great Ian Thorpe spoke about the pressure of being in the closet. View this image  Mark Metcalfe / Getty Images Speaking alongside Thorpe were other current and former elite athletes, including diver Matthew Mitcham, footballer Sally Shipard, rugby player Casey Conway, basketballer Shelley Gorman-Sandie, and swimmer Daniel Kowalski. If I had a little bit more time when I was younger, I would have come out. I would have been comfortable with that, he said. But because I told that lie, I was trying to suppress that part of me. When Thorpe did come out, he put together a list of people he wanted to tell. It was a very short list two of my friends, my sister and my parents, he said. I was going to space it out over a couple of weeks. Then I had finally found the courage to do it and I decided Id go one after the other. I started booking people in! It was amazing to have such a warm embrace from people, Thorpe said, I loved that most peoples reaction was OK, thats great. We dont care. Its nice to know that when youre being honest and open people do accept you. View this image  BuzzFeed News In some ways, there is an expectation that you will be the voice of this group, which none of us can do, he said. Its made up of many voices, and Im very new to this. I dont have the experience. However, Thorpe added, being a role model is a beautiful and powerful thing that athletes can do, even if it does carry a lot of responsibility. Thorpe will host The Bully Project on ABC, a show that will follow six teenagers to show the physical and verbal violence of bullying. You can see yourself in those kids, he said. Thats why Ive tried to be more active in this space as well. I want it to be easier for the next athletes to go through as well. Just under half of all surveyed said they thought bisexual, lesbian and gay people were only accepted a little, or not accepted at all, in Australian sporting culture. Approximately 85% of gay men and lesbians had experienced slurs such as faggot and dyke while playing sport. View this image  Stefan Postles / Getty Images After moving to Sydney from Wagga Wagga as a teenager for football, Shipard dealt with her sexuality by being very, very focused on football. I was very sure that I was straight because I didnt want to fit that stereotype, she said. I didnt want my sexuality to be defined by my sport. However, after temporarily stepping away from soccer at 21, she was able to come out, and is now a vocal advocate for more inclusion on and off the field. If anything, theres less shock around a female athlete announcing shes gay, Shipard said. Theres less media attention, less heads turn, its less newsworthy. View this image  BuzzFeed It was really hard, he said. I didnt really have a support network around me, I was looking around to see what I could cling onto, who I could trust. Conway dealt with his feelings by becoming a bully himself. He told the panel he had a girlfriend, and picked on other boys for being gay to try and play the part of the typical, masculine footy player. Because I was one of the better players coming through, expected to move onto a club, I did everything I could to try and push that part of me to the very back, not have anything to do with it. View this image  Matt Roberts / Getty Images Everybodys situation is different, he said. Its 20/20 hindsight you can say it once youre not in that environment anymore, but when youre in that environment its fear of the unknown. In the past, there has been a big fear of suffering financial penalties for coming out, Mitcham added. When more LGBTI athletes start coming out and they do get those big endorsements deals, their face on a Kelloggs box thats when younger kids are going to say, sexuality will not be a barrier to me being successful.

aS"We sent out a survey asking queer ladies about the last time they had sex so you can stop asking us how it works now. View this image  Does sex exclusively mean penetration? Whats the defining act, if there is one? In search of answers, BuzzFeed anonymously surveyed gay, bi, and trans women asking them to honestly and openly describe their last sexual encounter however they define it. Heres what they told us: My girlfriend and I bought a strap on to use for the first time and she insisted she use it on me first. We spent over two hours trying to figure out how straight sex works and then just gave up and used it as a dildo. At one point we got so defeated that she just laid on top of me and wiggled around; that was the farthest we got. 18/queer My fiancee and I were celebrating our third anniversary as a couple. Wed had a very good date night at a nice little local restaurant. We got home and things were getting pretty heavy and we proceeded up to the bedroom. I was doing my thing, just the way she likes it, when she suddenly tells me to stop and that shes not feeling it. I say OK and I try to ask her whats wrong. This has been an ongoing problem with her and her almost nonexistent sex drive. She doesnt have any answers so I just cuddle up next to her and try to go to sleep, frustrated. Were working on it. 33/Lesbian I thought shower sex would be good, clean fun. It turned out to be closer to getting waterboarded.  25/Bisexual It was a week night and I was over at my girlfriends place. We were just watching TV and she was scratching my back while I was laying on the floor, naked. She starts teasing my inner thighs, just brushing my crotch. She fingered me, making me cum a couple of times. It was really hot to be facedown on the floor while she got me off. So you know, just a normal weeknight. 23/Bisexual View this image  Terrible, she squirted all over my bed. Then she laid in her own urine until I couldnt take it anymore and bleached my bed.  34/Gay Been dating this girl for a couple of months now, heading in a direction which I hope is serious. Ive never laughed so much during sex with anyone else before! Not laughing at each other, we just happen to both be hilarious and find humor in everything and it really makes the sex better. She had her period this past weekend but went down on me for like an hour and I hit my head so many times on her headboard that I have a big bruise on my forehead, which we laughed about of course. Then she gave me an adorable handmade card and asked me to be her Valentine. We fell asleep shirtless, totally perfect. 23/Bisexual I had a sort-of threesome with a girl and a guy who picked me up at a club. Mostly, the woman and I performed oral on each other while the guy watched. There was some other stuff, but it was minimal. I did kiss him a little and let him go down on me for a minute. Nobody got off. It was 10am. We were all too drunk and too tired.  28/Lesbian My good friend and I worked in separate departments for the same company. Were both queer women and have discussed our sex and romantic lives on multiple occasions. A few months ago, after a particularly stressful week for us both, she texted me to say that was I ever interested in a super casual hookup, she was available. I was so exhausted from the week that I took it as a joke until I was kissing her in my car a few nights later. We ended up having really friendly sex a couple of times. We would laugh and joke the whole way through. In a weird way it was the most platonic ways to orgasm with another person. But it was a great stress relief and we communicated clearly that there were no romantic feelings involved. Best of all, were still good friends. 25/Bisexual My friend was having a 20th birthday party and it started out with a changing cast of about 12 people. As the night went on it ended up with 8 of us, all queer except one, all vagina-havers (many of us were non-binary, though). Despite us all already being solidly drunk we thought it be a great idea to play kings cup. We played for about thirty minutes before someone put on some amazing music and we all started dancing, which at some point ended up in taking clothes off, which ended up with me making out with a friend on a balcony in the rain, which ended up with another friend joining us, which ended up in everyone else noticing and wanting in, which ended up with us all on our one friends big bed in a mess of limbs. Everyone kept checking if everyone was cool with it (our one straight friend decided to see if shed be into it and dipped out quickly) and the whole thing was surprisingly not awkward. It went on for a couple ridiculous hours and I am fully aware of how much this sounds like some ridiculous porno but I swear on the collective scripts of every season of The L Word it was real life. 21/Bisexual & Non-Binary My ex and I dry humped for the last time. I dont think she came.But I did.  32/Queer Femme View this image  My girlfriend and I were eating lunch with some of my coworkers and we decided to finish early and go have a quickie in my apartment. Since I was wearing a dress, we didnt take off much clothing. She put her fingers in me and I playfully slapped her hand away and made her watch me masturbate for awhile. She wanted to be part of the action so she got on top of me and put her fingers inside of me again while I rubbed my clit. Then randomly I got the giggles (I think I said something silly?) and she recalled a childhood nickname and we laughed so hard we cried. We cuddled for a bit then went back at it again. After cumming once, I knew I had another one in me so I had her finger me from behind. After that, we washed up and she touched herself a little bit. I got to lick her fingers clean (one of my favorite things!). We didnt have time for much else, so we fixed our hair and clothes. I love that we can be goofy during sex but that it doesnt ruin the mood! 28/Queer Id been digging this girl for about two years. Young, beautiful and as it turned out gagging for it. I finally got her into my bed and realized I didnt fancy her any more. The chemistry had gone. I cuddled her briefly and went to sleep. 48/Bisexual It was my birthday and my girlfriend and I got a hotel. We drank some vodka, ate pizza, and made out in the hot tub for a while until some affronted looking little family came into the pool. After showering together and some foreplay, I dressed up in some new lingerie and she did a lap dance for me. She went down on me and we fingered each other. The next morning we watched The Princess Bride. 23/bisexual I hadnt seen my girlfriend for two weeks and as soon as I walked through her apartment door she said, I want to see your anus. Romance is alive.  28/Lesbian My now-ex-but-then-girlfriend told me to stay on the bed no matter what, so I did. She used a vibrator for a while, then left it in me and left the room for just a few moments; she came back into the room wearing heels several inches higher than she had ever done before. She thought it would be sexy AF and it was until she lost balance, doing the arm spin thing you only really see in cartoons. I cracked up laughing, tried to sit up to help her, and ended up switching on the vibrator just as it hit against my g-spot. She just sat on the floor looking at me like WTF? You came instead of helping me?! but I was too exhausted to do anything but give her a thumbs up. 21/Demisexual View this image  My last sexual encounter was quite kinky. My wife and I had gone out to eat at our favorite restaurant. I had come prepared and was packing. On our way home we stopped in the park and she sucked my strap on until I came while in her mouth. When we went home I tied her arms and legs to the bed and blindfolded her. I alternately poured hot wax and used ice on her to soothe the burns. I proceeded to take a toy and use it on her, getting her really ready while licking her clit at the same time. Every time shed get close to an orgasm, I pulled back or Id stop. Again and again I brought her close until she was panting for me, begging desperately. I finally let her cum and as she was cumming I started fucking her with my strap on. She came countless times until she was limp on the bed. I untied her afterwards and made her lay on her tummy. I rubbed her down with oil to get her to relax because she couldnt stop cumming. 30/Lesbian Usually she would initiate the act of lovemaking with kisses and jokes like now I will finally teach you how to do it, so youll become a proper lesbian (I recently came out). But this time was different. I put her hands up and behind her head. Kissed her neck and breast and belly. And then I started slowly eating her out. Usually she doesnt want my fingers inside her, but this time she did. We have a fun way of communicating, if she doesnt want to talk, she would pull my ear slightly. That means I should go faster. If she wants me to move in a different way, she would paint the movement on my shoulder. Every time she would teach me something new, but the best part is that we can communicate without any shame in so many ways. And we can always laugh about everything. 22/Queer After a few months of being together with my girlfriend, and many people asking about scissoring, we decided to try it. After her kicking me in the eye not once, but THREE TIMES, we gave up. 19/Bisexual After a police raid scare while attending an underground Brooklyn queer space, I took a taxi over to his apartment at 3:00 a.m.. This was the first and last time I had sex since Ive been on an affirming hormone regimen. We engaged in oral and anal sex, with me being the penetrated partner. The orgasm from penetrative sex was the most intense Ive ever experienced, which I attribute to the complete suppression of testosterone. NA/Queer Trans Femme It was just briefly after my girlfriend and I started having sex. We were both virgins before we got together, so not only were we figuring out how bodies worked in general, we were trying to figure out how we, as two women, we supposed to have sex. We eventually got the jist of it (it involved a lot of fingers and mouths), we decided to try scissoring. It always sounded great to me in theory. Well, imagine two grown humans on a tiny college twin XL bed. Long story short, I ended naked and on the floor after falling off the bed. Scissoring working for some people, but to this day, I cant figure that shit out. 20/Bisexual I was at Hot Rabbit in New York City, its a regular queer lady dance party. Id actually been running into her at queer dances parties for a while, and this time she asked me if I wanted to go back to her place. We took a cab back to her place, where things got kind of awkward. She was menstruating, and I had forgotten I was wearing a packer. When she discovered it in my underwear she made some transmisogynist remarks about how she was soooo glad it came off, and I considered just leaving right then. But I didnt, she wound up fisting me and in the morning she made me pancakes. It sounds strange and fantastical. I actually lost my cellphone shortly after, so I lost her number and have resigned myself to being that asshole who never called back. Then again I also learned later she was the ex of a friend of mines wife (our community is so small, even in a place like NYC), and that she was kinda drama central, so maybe I really dodge a bullet there? 27/Non-binary View this image  My girlfriend and I are both queer/bisexual, but shes definitely had more experiences with women than I have and I am still a little intimidated by it. In my experience, with men its pretty straightforward and Ive never had a problem making them cum, but with women, theres so much more nuance and adjustment (and time) involved. Personally, I prefer being teased on the outside (the more gentle/subtle it is, the more aroused I am), starting from the clit and then slowly moving down towards the opening of the vagina, and finally being penetrated with fingers as I cum. My girlfriend likes being penetrated from the start and VIOLENTLY, might I add! Often, my wrist starts to hurt and I have to switch positions or pause for a moment, but in the meantime its like the moment passes, so I have to start building it up again and then.. were back to square one. I still havent been able to make her cum on my own and that makes me feel insecure sometimes, but she has never made me feel shitty about it (man, its so nice to fuck a mature adult). We also both enjoy a little power play, she identifies as a switch and Im mostly submissive, so every once in a while shed grab me by the throat or spank me, which really gets me going. Im super excited for us to start incorporating toys, like floggers and riding crops. We use a strap-on (so far only she has used it on me, though Id like to try it on her soon) and theres always a laugh involved with that. I like that were able to have fun in between the dirty, passionate stuff. 26/Queer My girlfriend and I have been together for about a year now. For our anniversary we went to a B&B for a night and had sex three times with dinner at a nice restaurant in between, and wine in the bathtub. The only toy weve used is a vibrator, and personally, I prefer when we touch each other. We can feel everything so much more you know? I held her hands above her head, and blindfolded her. It was great, and brought teasing to a whole new level. 19/Bisexual This girl had come over once before, we met over the tinder-like app called Her. Were the same age and attend different colleges. She comes into my room, and I ask her about her day and about three minutes into the conversation we start kissing. First I was on top, I used my mouth and my fingers (and combinations) to please her. She got pretty loud, so I gave her a pillow and then covered her mouth with my hand, and as we continued maybe 1-2 hrs into it my suite mate interrupts with a knock on the unlocked door. I shouted, Dont open the door! She said, do you have someone over?? I just responded yes and we continued as if nothing happened. She was on top of me and she pleased me with her mouth and fingers. After a break, we were around 3 hrs into it now, I got on top of her and then we grinded for a while. She left maybe 4-5 hrs after we started. It was definitely a memorable night, and I got plenty of questions the next day. 20/Lesbian I looked at my wife and asked her if she wanted to have sex while we were both randomly browsing the internet. She agreed and to help us get turned on we each read some erotica. Afterward, we headed into our bedroom and she started going down on me. I got close to climax a few times but I couldnt reach it so we switched positions and I started to go down on her instead. I should mention that at this point it was getting pretty close to 5 oclock and I have night classes which make me have to leave home at 5:30, so after about ten minutes of me eating her out and her not managing to cum we decided to be lazy and got out our magic wand vibrator. She put it between her legs. I straddled her and lowered myself down so that we could hit the right spot. We both came pretty quickly, but I can have multiple orgasms so even after I came she encouraged me to keep going. I ended up squirting for the first time ever which was both strange and a little terrifying for me. Naturally afterward I had to clean up to get to class and she had to clean up as well and wash the sheets since we werent expecting anything quite like that to happen. 22/Bisexual After a while of just tip-toeing around each other, we finally got into my bed, laid down to watch a movie and my hand slipped into her sweat pants then hers into mine. We never even kissed or looked at each other just fingered each other until I came then we stopped. It was my first time and it was so awkward that we got up and just went for a very quite and awkward walk afterwards. 23/Queer View this image  One evening my partner and I were at a kink party that involved lots and lots of rope. I was suspended in a scene where my partner and another close friend were topping me and this is something we do once or twice a month. Our play scenes although sensual are not sexual when others are involved. That night was different. Im pre-op and tuck in panties when we play and the scene was getting intense. Then they both were lightly using a crop on my genitals and it sent me into overdrive and I orgasmed right there in the dungeon multiple times. An incredible scene, but it didnt end for the night. My sexual energy stayed high the whole evening and so was my partners. After the scene we went home and my partner was so horny for my to go down on her and I desperately wanting too. She came multiple times and so did I from just going down on her. 45/ Trans Being two very femme lesbians our hair happens to be very long. As we started making out, our hair kept going in our mouths and made for a rather awkward time, right before I went down on her, I said I swear if I get one more hair in my mouth Im going to quit. Guess what? Yeah, her hair somehow managed to get down there and it was the biggest cock block ever needless to say we spent the rest of the night in silence. 19/Queer I had my girlfriend sit on my face and lemme tell ya, it was awkward and I dont see the appeal. She kept losing balance and my tongue wasnt nearly long enough to reach her, so I was craning my neck unbelievably far. We gave up like a minute in and then we just went with the ol strap on. 21/Lesbian My girlfriend and I braved the frigid New England winter to go see our favorite poet at a book signing. At the very start of the night, we could not wait to get naked in bed together. After the signing, we rushed home to feel that physical connection. Our connection always begins with our tongues. After a kiss or two, I immediately become soaking wet. Once she starts touching my body, I get achy and impatient. On this night she surprised me by touching herself something that drives me completely wild. As I was arched over her, I looked down to watch her touch herself and me at the same time. Every so often she took my cum and put it on herself. Eventually this became too much to bare and I began to kiss her neck, then breasts, then stomach, and lastly I ended in between her legs where I stayed for a while to taste her. Eventually we made it to the 69 position (which I hadnt yet tried before dating her) its fantastic. She came first and after, she went down on me until I came. Then we went inside each other while kneeling on the bed to keep the orgasm going longer. Our sex is always phenomenal. It makes me wonder why anyone would have anything other than lesbian sex. 30/Lesbian 31. What Do People Actually Do When They Have Sex? buzzfeed.com Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Chariots Roman Spa in Shoreditch, east London, closed last Sunday. BuzzFeed News donned a towel to experience the climactic final few hours. View this image  Patrick Strudwick It is 4pm on Sunday 21 February. As I turn into Fairchild Street in Shoreditch, east London, theres something Ive never seen here before: a queue out the door of Chariots. Normally, people head quickly in. But today is different: After 19 years, Britains biggest gay sauna will close, and tomorrow demolition awaits. This, then, is the last hurrah. More than 20 LGBT venues have closed in London this decade. The capitals gay scene is gasping for air, and now, with the end of Chariots, even the steam is evaporating. When news of the imminent closure broke earlier this month in the Evening Standard, the reason surprised no one: The site is being sold to developers. A luxury hotel awaits. But the story behind it goes beyond a widespread exasperation with gentrification. Its a story about what is really being lost. Chariots (or Chariots Roman Spa, to use its full name) is a chain of four gay saunas all within London. Its vast Shoreditch branch, the largest in Europe (20,000 square feet), lies at the intersection of 4 million flats and 4 flat whites. The map calls this Fairchild Street. Given the value of the land, many are surprised Chariots has held out this long. View this image  Patrick Strudwick The week leading up to the closure comes with another visit from the reaper: Four days before, it emerges that the chains Streatham branch has already closed, also sold to a developer after nearly 20 years. Its last day of business had been Valentines Day. Cupids arrow hit the jugular. Anger and frustration mounts, online and among activists. ACT UP London an HIV direct action group decide to join forces with other campaigners in a last-chance-saloon effort to save Chariots. They are unaware it is too late. Two days before the Shoreditch closure, ACT UP London and the Radical Faeries a movement of queer, anti-establishment activists stage a protest in the car park outside the Shoreditch branch. They hold banners aloft reading, Poppers not pop-ups. They chant. They drum. They sprinkle a concoction of semen and glitter on the ground as someone wearing an outfit best described as acid-house nun reads out a curse on the property developers. Surprisingly, this intervention does not succeed. It later transpires that the sauna had already stayed open longer than it was originally supposed to the new owners let them extend it. As customers prepare for Chariots final weekend, two quotes from the original Evening Standard article ring out. The first is from a regular visitor called Richard Unwin who describes the forthcoming closure as devastatingthe latest in a long line of LGBT venues being closed down and replaced with bland heteronormativity. The second is a tweet from Chariots to one of its customers: Enjoy it while its there. So I decide to do just that, to experience Chariots one last time; to see what bland heteronormativity will be bulldozing, and whether apologies Chariots will go out with a bang. Patrick Strudwick Patrick Strudwick Aside from the queue, the sauna, which Americans would call a bathhouse, appears just as it always has: a boxy, blue, three-story construction, with a busy car park in the front. The queue is remarkable because even at busy times the sheer size of the place with hundreds of lockers, three stories, a pool, two Jacuzzis, three shower rooms, a lounge, three saunas, two steam rooms, a dark room, and a couple of dozen private cabins is enough to house high numbers. I stop for a minute to look at the scene ahead, to consider what has taken place here over the years. Thousands have met and had sex. Some found love. Two men died (in 2006 and 2012). Several were caught in a fire (in March 2011, more of which later). Men have wept and slept here, strung out after days of partying. Others have indulged secret desires before going home to their wives. Justin Fashanu, the first and only premiership footballer to come out, spent his last night here before killing himself. Some have had their first, tentative gay experiences in this converted warehouse, nestled in between Great Eastern Street and Bishopsgate, as hipsters, shoppers, and business folk pass by unaware. With such a hothouse of human drama, it is surprising that next weeks Channel 4 documentary about life inside a similar establishment in Nottingham Secrets of the Sauna wasnt made years ago. I approach the door as the queue shortens, just enough to allow me to squeeze into the foyer. Three notices on the walls blare out: two about drugs (warning that youll be kicked out if found taking or dealing), and one regarding anti-LGBT hate crime. A few years ago there was a spate of homophobic attacks in the area. Twenty-three men are ahead of me in the queue. Most are silent, with the occasional murmur of, Whats the hold-up? before someone in the know offers the answer. Due to the numbers arriving on this last day there is a one-in-one-out policy. Its a bit like the EU. And its equally tense: People are being forced to see each other in daylight, all knowing the purpose of their visit. Patrick Strudwick Patrick Strudwick A tall, bald man says loudly to no one in particular: Theyve probably just lost the keys to half the lockers. People laugh. Ive got nothing worth stealing anyway. And with that he sneaks through the inner door as a customer leaves, without the attendant noticing. Another visitor, naked and already inside, is leaning over the counter talking to a member of staff. I can only hear snatches of their conversation. Im here for the memories, he says. Ten years Ive been coming. Long time. He says hell stay until midnight, until they lock the doors. He looks down. Every few minutes, amid the silence in the foyer, people tut and sigh. I imagine this escalating wildly, so that by the time we get into the sauna a riot is in full swing. Hopefully this will not involve the police arresting me in the nude. Hush resumes until a blond man in his late twenties enters the foyer and joins the queue, talking manically, wide-eyed and moist-faced. My suspicions that he is on uppers are confirmed when he tells me Im good-looking. And the man next to me. And then asks him, Do you want some coke? It is unclear which variety he means, and a far greater transgression he does not seem to have absorbed the two pillars of British etiquette on display: queuing orderly, and never talking to other humans unless formally introduced. Still we wait. A middle-aged man turns round and smiles at me. Have we met here before? It is so hard to know. Forty minutes have passed. Now only eight people are ahead of me, including what appears to be a couple, who kiss each other intermittently until the older, fairer one reminds his companion about when you got me arrested and stopped me seeing my daughter. Remember? Patrick Strudwick Patrick Strudwick There is no time to contemplate what this might mean because finally after an hour I am able to pay. The attendant hands over a locker key and two towels and I am inside. I walk down the corridor: toilets and showers to the left, and into a series of locker rooms. One of which comes off the lounge/bar area. You can order drinks, coffees, and hot food. The menu promises lasagne and chilli con carne, although I suspect the Michelin reviewers have yet to sample these. A large television screen transmits the BBC News. Men in towels are draped on sofas vaguely regarding its political editor, Laura Kuenssberg. I turn back into the changing area. Her voice carries through. Shes relaying the fact that Boris Johnson has just announced his support for coming out of the EU. Men are stripping swiftly by the lockers. They seem rather more interested in another kind of in-out. As I undress, a man comes to retrieve his belongings from the locker next to mine. He smiles. Good time? I ask. Yeah, but knackered, Ive been going since 1pm. You get all sorts here, thats why I love it. He tells me hes a university lecturer, and is 54. Why does he come here? Sex, he says. Is that the only reason? Yeah. Ive been single my whole life. Why? Too busy. He says he works from 5:45am until 10pm every day. Whos going to put up with that? I wonder why he does and why he makes time for a sauna and not a relationship. Is it really just the sex he comes for? He thinks for a moment, his eyes moving around as if scanning back through the last two decades. Well I suppose when I was younger Id come for the social side, he says. When we lost the London Lesbian and Gay Centre in Farringdon [a community centre that closed in the 1990s] where you used to be able to go and meet people, I really felt that, and missed that. We lost a lot of people, too, back then. It is obvious what he means. The AIDS epidemic savaged a generation not only with death, but through terror: fear of sex, even of intimacy itself was not unusual. I know people who have never had penetrative sex as a result. The man changes the subject and says cheerfully, Theyre serving pizza here for everyone at 9 oclock! Patrick Strudwick Patrick Strudwick We say goodbye. Naked, I wrap an off-white towel around my waist and walk up the stairs to the action. The first floor is devoted to cruising: corridors with cabins of varying size, in which gentlemen commune with other gentlemen. I walk down the first stretch of corridor, lit only by tiny red and green lights. It is busy, with dozens filling the space, moist from sweat or steam. Everyone is silent. Eyes communicate everything. Some men wait in the doorways to the cabins, watching passers-by, catching their glance when interested. Some walk round and round. I follow their gaze and movements, which adhere to a particular pattern. It is said that West Hollywood, the epicenter of gay LA, is a bunch of 10s (on a scale of attractiveness from 110) looking for 11s. Here it is 3s looking for 4s, 6s looking for 7s, and 10s looking at nobody, until everyone decides to settle. It is a microcosm of dating life. Others do not walk anywhere, preferring instead to sit or lie in the cabins, waiting. Hunting takes many forms. The rooms are all similar: more dim lighting, yellow this time, with a kind of bed/bench covered in black, wipe-clean leatherette. A tissue dispenser is attached to the wall. Condom and lube dispensers abound. I walk round a square of corridors. In one room a lone, naked man is perched on all fours with the door open. Perhaps he is looking for a contact lens. A loud spanking sound emanates from a nearby cabin. From another there are moans. No one pays attention. It is, aside from the inflated numbers here today, business as usual. I reach the dark room at the back. Only about six men are here with not much going on bar a little light oral fun in one corner. Hardly the last days of Rome. So I make my way upstairs to the top floor. The waft of chlorine hits me as the staircase opens out into the spa area. The swimming pool is partially spot-lit with muted, multicoloured lights. Two men are doing lengths, their buttocks bobbing up and down near the surface. Others are lying on loungers, resting. I head to the large Jacuzzi. Patrick Strudwick Patrick Strudwick There are two other men: one very large and black, one white with a shaved head. I sink into the bubbles, knowing this is for the last time, and consider what this place and others like it really are. Gay saunas are as full of paradoxes as naked men: Customers come for connection but in the disconnect of anonymity seeking company but always leaving alone. The allure is escapism but all around other men reflect back to you who you are. Nudity promises to be a great leveller but unleashes a more brutal stratification: bodies are judged. And the pursuit of a quick fix can lead to hours wandering in circles of ever-decreasing self-esteem. Happily, the paradoxes splay in both directions. The apparatus of washing is all around yet it delivers unerring filth. Saunas appear relatively modern but are reassuringly ancient: the Romans invented the technology; the Greeks invented the sodomy. And here, Chariots has paid somewhat cheesy homage to its heritage, with faux-classical statues, an image of a Roman chariot on its sign, and a rudimentary Grecian arch over the entrance. In the 1970s, bathhouses flourished across Europe and the United States. Ballet dancer Rudolph Nureyev, widely regarded as the greatest ever, frequented Parisian gay saunas. You dont seriously expect me to go without sex for more than 11 hours, do you? he is reported to have asked a director. Public figures have always come to saunas: There have been many sightings of politicians. A man I dated swore he fellated Kurt Cobain in a Seattle sauna in 1990. There are all kinds of nirvana. View this image  Patrick Strudwick In the 1980s, as AIDS hit, bathhouses closed. But from the late 1990s, as antiretroviral treatment transformed HIV into something people more often lived with than died from, saunas sprung up again. There are seven in London. Earlier in the noughties, before Grindr and spiralling gentrification, there were 11. I sit in one of the steam rooms. There are six other men, some of whom have removed towels completely, and two of them are getting to know each other with noticeable enthusiasm. I move next door to the main sauna room and stay for a while, roasting, contemplating the timing of Chariots closure. It is two months until the ban on poppers comes in and two weeks since the government decided reportedly following an intervention from the prime minister not to make sex education compulsory in all schools. A cynical observer might suggest the government only wants gay men to marry, sexless, neutered by suburban acceptability. But I suspect David Cameron might approve of Chariots: every man for himself, hunting with naked ambition for a money shot. In the large pink-lit wet room, there are more men lying down. A lot of resting happens here. I join them and, since it is not the done thing to talk let alone ask people questions, I think back to my early twenties when I used to come here regularly. View this image  Patrick Strudwick The outside world didnt feel very safe then. Obviously gay from a young age, I heard and felt its attitudes towards me keenly. Sometimes painfully. I suffered terrible anxiety at that time following a brutal homophobic attack something I needed to numb. I used food, I used sleeping pills, and I would come here: cut off from my life, my head, distracted by this bewitching, hidden world. As men showed an interest, it was respite too from insecurities. No one is immune. For many, however, it is simply about sex, almost literally on tap. The decadent commitment shown to this pursuit was never more admirably displayed than during the fire here in 2011. My friend Javier was there. He tells me: I was having sex with this guy when we heard an alarm, so we stopped and went downstairs, where we could smell smoke. Members of staff were pushing customers out through the exit. I managed to grab my clothes just in time but most were just in towels. He laughs. We all stood in the car park, in the cold early morning, as people were walking past. I saw three men continue to wank each other off by the side of a car. And I hadnt finished with the man Id met, so, as the sauna burned, we fucked in an alleyway nearby. Patrick Strudwick Patrick Strudwick It is 7pm, two hours until pizza is served. But who would want the inevitable bloating while attempting to have sex? And who in Shoreditch doesnt have a gluten intolerance? I decide on one last tour round. A lap of dishonour. I walk round the cruising area again and pass someone who smells of alcohol, presumably from the night before. At the Vauxhall branch, men have been found overdosed on party drugs. Perhaps this inspired next months new zombie drama set in a gay bathhouse. The films name? Sauna the Dead. I take one last dip in the Jacuzzi. Two men are arm-in-arm. I get up to leave, Dont go, says one. Threesome! I smile back, tempted, but for a far greater depravity that has lingered from earlier as I recalled my youth: feelings. I dry off and dress, handing my locker key to the attendant and stepping out into the evening, thinking of who else has left these doors since 1997, soothed by the water and steam and sex: the horny, the lonely, the famous, the drug-fucked, the suits, the closets, the couples craving spice, the young craving touch, all seeking a closeness and escape unavailable anywhere else. They all came here. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS'Men dont vomit at the sight of trans women in comedies anymore, but recent releases like Deadpool and Zoolander 2 demonstrate how trans and gender-nonconforming people are still reduced to empty punchlines. View this image  Warner Bros., Paramount Pictures Theres a scene from Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994) in which the title character, played by Jim Carrey, is so disgusted with himself that he pukes in the toilet twice and has to empty an entire tube of toothpaste to brush his teeth. He then takes off all his clothes, puts them in a trash can, and burns them, before getting into the shower and weeping as the camera pans out. Its a clear parody of scenes in dramas involving women who take showers after being sexually assaulted. The traumatic event that caused this reaction? The discovery that Lois Einhorn, a female police detective played by Sean Young who had just kissed Ace in a previous scene is the same person as Ray Finkel, a man Ace suspects of kidnapping the Miami Dolphins mascot Snowflake and quarterback Dan Marino. The knowledge that Ace has kissed a man sends him into a shamed panic spiral. And when Ace reveals Einhorns former identity by forcibly exposing the bulge in her underwear to practically her entire police department at the end of the movie, all the men retch as Aces real woman love interest Melissa (Courteney Cox) observes in puzzlement. View this image  Jim Carrey in Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. Warner Bros. More than two decades later, Ace Ventura comes across as blatantly transmisogynist (a term the author Julia Serano coined to specify the intersection of transphobia and misogyny that trans women too often deal with). Lois ceases to be a full-fledged human being as soon as shes revealed to be trans, so she can be subjected to such cruelties as having her body forcibly exposed for public display without consequence. Loiss humiliation itself is the butt of the joke and the mens disgust centers the movies attempt at ick-factor body humor. On the surface, there isnt much comparison between Ace Venturas explicit transphobia and the in-bad-taste but certainly tamer jokes in two comedies that opened recently: Zoolander 2 and Deadpool. In a reprise of their roles as preening male supermodel Derek Zoolander and his sidekick Hansel, Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson have been supplanted as the most popular models on the planet by the nonbinary, agender model All (Benedict Cumberbatch). In Deadpool, Ryan Reynolds plays the pansexual title character prone to bawdy jokes about queer people. But threading a line from comedies of the early 90s to those that feature transgender themes today reveals that even though there has been steady progress in humanizing trans characters, harmful stereotypes still plague trans women and gender-nonconforming characters. Transfeminine people are nearly always presented as villains and objects of derision or disgust, especially in comparison to conventionally attractive cisgender love interests. The last 25 years of evolving transgender themes in mainstream comedy also demonstrate the projections and fears of the cisgender men both behind and in front of the camera. Trans characters particularly trans women are often inserted into a comedys narrative to fulfill a gross-out shock factor (Lol! I cant believe a normal man got tricked into sleeping with a disgusting, abnormal she-male! is the audience reaction these filmmakers are going for). The audience is also supposed to laugh because a man has been deceived by these women, and straight male viewers can take comfort since the humiliation is not their own. The way trans characters are used and abused exemplifies the lengths heterosexual cisgender men will go to demonize trans women in order to deny them womanhood, as well as reaffirm their own desperately fragile masculinity. If Ace Ventura marked the full-fledged incorporation of transphobia into movie comedies, then Soapdish (1991) was an essential precursor. In that movie, a scheming Montana Moorehead (Cathy Moriarty) tries to topple Celeste Talbert (Sally Field), as the star of the soap opera The Sun Also Sets, by seducing producer David Seton Barnes (Robert Downey Jr.). After a series of twists and turns involving David and Montana conniving to give Celeste more and more absurd and unsympathetic scenes to act out so the shows fans would reject her, its brought to light that Montana used to be Milton Moorehead; cast and crew react in horror and wonderment, while Montana runs from the set in shame. Though the transgender-woman-as-villain trope in American movie comedies did not originate with Soapdish that dubious honor arguably belongs to the roundly panned film adaptation of Gore Vidals novel Myra Breckinridge (1970) the 90s comedy demonstrated the tropes effectiveness as a modern plot device. Montanas transgender reveal is a shocking and absurd twist that elucidates her deceitful nature; if she lied about being trans, then shes a liar at heart. David, whod slept with her, attempts to control his retching reaction, as he excuses himself from the set to presumably vomit. By the time Ace Ventura and Jim Carreys over-the-top antics rolled around in 1994, the forced exposure of a characters trans status was amplified by using the outlines of her genitals. In between Soapdish and Ace Ventura was the much-talked-about drama The Crying Game (1992), which became a cause clbre when, during what feels like a gritty drama involving the love affair between a man and a woman, the woman is shown to have a penis and the man pukes in the bathroom. View this image  Leslie Nielsen in Naked Gun 33 . Paramount Pictures Ace Ventura is an overt comedic take on this revelation, as was Naked Gun 33 (1994) from the same year. In that movie, police detective Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) has an ongoing flirtation with the villains girlfriend and accomplice Tanya Peters (Anna Nicole Smith), who attempts to seduce him several times during the movie. Near the end of the film, the two find themselves alone in a dressing room at the Academy Awards, when Tanya undresses in silhouette and her shadow gives away her penis. Frank reacts in utter disgust, and ends up puking inside a tuba for laughs. One of the major indicators of trans womens villainy in these movies: They did not disclose their trans status. The fact that theyre killers, blackmailers, or terrorists is intertwined with them hiding their male past, though the humiliating revelation that theyre trans is typically treated as more shocking and important than the crimes theyve committed. The exposure of these women becomes synonymous with catching them; theres no meaningful difference made between finding out a woman is trans and discovering that shes a criminal. In the end, movies that depict trans women as deceitful, disgusting villains divulge more about the cisgender male psyche than they do about transgender women (after all, the filmmakers and writers who imagined these characters are overwhelmingly cisgender men). The trans-woman-as-villain plot device represents mens fear of being duped into sacrificing their heterosexual male privilege by deigning to sleep with a person they consider to be a man. Seen in this way, the puking reaction to trans revelation in these movies is not really borne of disgust at the women themselves, who are played by conventionally-attractive cisgender actresses rather, the disgust is borne of mens self-loathing for continuing to be attracted to these women. Since the 90s, male-focused comedies have had a fascinating, almost obsessive preoccupation with transgender women, in movies like Dude Wheres My Car? (2000), The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005), and The Hangover Part 2 (2011), not to mention a plethora of TV comedies and movies with one-off gags at trans womens expense, most notably in Ted 2 (2015). The message in these movies and shows is almost always that trans women are revolting and less than human. Dude Wheres My Car? explicitly uses the trans woman-as-criminal trope, when Jesse and Chester (Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott), two teenage stoner dudes, wake up not knowing where their car is, and find themselves at a strip joint called the Kitty Kat Club. There they meet Tania (Teressa Tunney), a stripper who gave Jesse a lap dance the night before that he doesnt end up remembering. Tania turns out to be a transgender thief who gave the guys a suitcase full of cash for safekeeping and wants it back. There are the standard gags, inherited from 90s comedies, of Tania demonstrating the bulge in her underwear to come out as trans at least shes empowered enough to do it herself, rather than being outed against her will. Typically, Jesse reacts by retching. Tania also speaks in a low, masculine voice whenever she demands her money from Jesse and Chester, and an artificially feminine one when she doesnt want people to know shes trans. Tanias voice (dubbed, since shes played by a cis woman) is meant to once again underline the connection between deceiving other people and her criminal behavior. Later movies of the 2000s have shied away from this trans woman as deceiver trope, replacing it instead with another method for distancing normal men from transgender attraction. In The 40-Year-Old Virgin, the virgin man in question, Andy (Steve Carell) gets set up with a transgender sex worker whom he rejects. Later, Andy confronts his friends about the incident, in a scene rife with transphobic jokes, designed to depict the trans woman as inhuman and disgusting. View this image  Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, and Romany Malco in The 40-Year-Old Virgin. Universal Pictures Part of the joke is that Andys friend Jay (Romany Malco), who hired the sex worker, couldnt tell she was trans despite the obvious signs. Its curious that in a bro comedy genre dominated by white men (none of the previous movies discussed so far have any prominent male minority characters), its now the black guy who cant tell an obvious trans woman apart from a cis woman. It seems as though the white male director (Judd Apatow) and screenwriters (Apatow and Carell) were hesitant to have a white man play the part of a trans-attracted male. Of course, the other part of the joke is the vulgarity of Andys description how he seems eager to denigrate the trans womans identity in the harshest words possible. The joke can be funny only if the audience, like the characters in the movie, refuses to treat the trans woman as a person. But were supposed to empathize with Andys plight and root for him to get properly laid, even if hes this weird guy whos 40 and hasnt had sex. Andy finally succeeds when he ends up with a normal woman and has old-fashioned heterosexual sex by the end of the movie. This contrast between the type of guy who ends up with a trans woman and the one who doesnt is even more stark in The Hangover Part II, when the wimpy Stu (Ed Helms) is about to get married in Thailand and invites the debonair Phil (Bradley Cooper) to join him. When they end up getting drugged and blacking out, they retrace their steps and find out that Stu ended up having sex with a transgender bar girl the previous night, when they visit her dressing room at a club. Hide Warning This image is graphic Click to reveal View this image  Ed Helms and Bradley Cooper in The Hangover Part II. Warner Bros. Hey, youre in Bangkok sweetie, the bar girl begins, Theres a reason they dont call it Bangcunt. She turns around to reveal her penis, and both Stu and Andy reel. The comedy in the rest of the scene comes from the woman detailing Stus exploits with her, including how much he enjoyed having sex with her and the fact that he was the bottom in their encounter. The soft, unmanly Stu flails and cries in misery while the type-A, macho Phil visibly tries to keep himself from puking, recalling the reaction of many men before him. Phil acts as the comforting, normative presence for the audience the one straight guy viewers are supposed to identify with in contrast to the inadequate Stu, who can now add an accidental attraction to trans women to his list of faults. Phils solution to Stus distress is even more telling. I promise you, no ones going to ever find out about this, Phil says when Stu asks him what he should do. And when Stu replies that he cant prevent himself from knowing hes had sex with a trans woman and enjoyed it, Phil consoles him further by saying: You just forget. It goes away. This is the lesson these comedies want us to learn: Men should forget about their attractions to trans women or, if they cant, at least not acknowledge their existence. To me, its clear that the revulsion expressed in these movies is simply a symptom of how much straight men are privately attracted to what they publicly reject. If the prevalence of transgender porn and the number of well-known men whove been caught cavorting with trans women are any indication, then the transgender comedy in these movies says more about male fetish (especially for preoperative trans women) than it does about trans women themselves. It doesnt matter if their experiences are pleasurable or that the trans women they interact with are actual human beings with individual qualities societal taboo prevents these male characters from acknowledging trans humanity, because doing so would compromise their precious heteromasculinity. This is where we come to Deadpool and Zoolander 2, two movies that seem to account for previous history as well as the recent conversations about trans people. Theyve arrived at a time when trans visibility and political power have grown in Hollywood, especially over the past year with the advent of Caitlyn Jenner, and the continued success of Laverne Cox and other trans actors, as well as shows like Transparent and Sense8. We seem to have arrived at an era where blatantly dehumanizing depictions of trans people run enough risk of deterring a mainstream audience that filmmakers and writers are careful to avoid them explicitly. Both Zoolander 2 and Deadpool take aim at less obvious and more indirect targets. A petition to boycott Zoolander had already garnered almost 25,000 signatures immediately after the trailer came out, mainly on the basis that the gender non-binary character All is played by a cisgender man, Benedict Cumberbatch. As the petitioner Sarah Rose wrote, All is portrayed as an over-the-top, cartoonish mockery of androgyne/trans/non-binary individuals. View this image  Owen Wilson, Ben Stiller, and Benedict Cumberbatch in Zoolander 2. Paramount Pictures The problem is not just that All is over-the-top, as so many portrayals of minorities in these mainstream movies are, but the specific ways that All is made fun of, as well as the surrounding depictions of queer people in the movie. Already, the entire premise of the Zoolander movies is to make fun of male models for having qualities traditionally associated with women namely vanity and appearance-consciousness. In Zoolander 2, Derek Zoolander and his sidekick Hansel are brought out of retirement to supposedly headline a big-time fashion show. But after a decade out of the limelight, they find that theyre out of touch with the current fashion world. At the fashion show, theyre introduced to the agender model All, who has supplanted them as the most sought-after model in the world. Upon meeting All, Hansel first asks whether All has a hot dog or a bun, then specifies, Do you have a wiener or a vaginer? The movie happily mocks Hansel for being out-of-touch with current culture for any number of reasons, but not for asking about a trans persons genitals, or basing his judgment of a persons gender on them. He later shouts, Definitely a hot dog! after All dresses as a gargoyle and whips Zoolander and Hansel with their tail. This scene once again brings back the trope of trans femme as villain. Since the movie makes fun of All by saying that All is marrying hermself, it treats the possibility of non-binary gender identification as obviously absurd, trivializing the concerns of an increasingly important segment of the transgender community. Theres also the head-scratching appearance of Kiefer Sutherland as a man whos been impregnated by Hansel, who in his time off has been a part of a group relationship that includes people of various fetishes as well as a goat. In the world of Zoolander 2, transgender people blend flatly together with polyamorists, sado-masochists, and people who practice beastiality, because theyre all just part of the same joke. But what isnt a joke is the attraction between Zoolander and the hot cisgender woman Valentina (Penelope Cruz). Shes in charge of solving crimes against fashion, and helps Zoolander find his long-lost son, another symbol of his sympathetic normalcy despite his unorthodox behavior. The two of them end up together in a celebration of heterosexuality, and Zoolanders male-model eccentricities are redeemed by both fatherhood and traditional straight attraction. View this image  Gina Carano and Ryan Reynolds in Deadpool. 20th Century Fox This reverence for cisgender heterosexual coupling is something Zoolander 2 and Deadpool have in common, even though both director Tim Miller and actor Ryan Reynolds describe the titular character as pansexual. At the beginning of the movie, Wade Wilson is just an ordinary Special Forces veteran who works as mercenary in New York and falls in love with sex worker Vanessa Carlysle (Morena Baccarin). After Wade gets diagnosed with terminal cancer, he decides to join a secret program that promises to cure him and give him special powers. Hes subjected to a series of tortures that artificially brings out his inborn genetic mutation; he transforms into Deadpool, a mutant with super-healing powers. Deadpool allows itself a great deal of license to make fun of the LGBT community, in large part because it presents Deadpool as part of that community a knowing, pansexual New Yorker who isnt uptight about established gender and sexuality norms. When he and his best friend joke about giving each other blow jobs, or when he yells Teabag! after sitting on top of a villain after vanquishing him, his jokes are presented as progressive in-group humor, rather than an outsider making fun of queer people. Yet no actual same-gender action happens in the film (except in an easy-to-miss animation as part of the credits). The one relationship treated seriously is the love between Deadpool and his ideal soulmate-esque cis woman girlfriend, Vanessa. The one hint of queerness between them when Vanessa pegs Deadpool in a montage of humorous sex scenarios is played for comedy. Since the devotion between the two forms the serious heart of the movie, queer attraction is presented as humorous, trivial, and fleeting, while overarching heterosexual love is forever. But more regressive than the appropriations of queerness such as Wades gratingly fey intonation, or his campy love of musicals as evidenced by his RENT shirt and Bernadette Peters purse, is the movies treatment of women: trans, lesbian, and cisgender. One of the villains in the movie is Angel Dust (Gina Carano), a super-strong, buff woman who is part of a group that subjects Deadpool to a series of tortures, and ends up plotting to enslave him. Upon first meeting Angel Dust, Deadpool says, Arent you a little strong for a lady? Im calling wang. And later, as another villain Ajax leaves the room, Wade says, Oh come on, youre going to leave me all alone here with less-angry Rosie ODonnell? The original trailer has this moment as Jose Canseco instead of Rosie ODonnell, which, according to Entertainment Weekly, is one of several options the director Tim Miller considered, including Louise Ferrigno. Again, the trope of the villainous trans or butch woman who is really a man dressed as a woman comes into play, which is insulting both to trans and cis women. Whether Angel Dust is transgender or cisgender isnt addressed in the movie, but either way, it presents trans women or cis women with muscular body types as evil, while the conventionally beautiful woman, Vanessa, is painted as good almost to the point of sacredness. Deadpools biggest problem is not necessarily that it treats LGBT people as punchlines many movies do that but that it does so while trying to pretend to be politically progressive at the same time, circumventing the antipathy of a general public that has over the last 25 years become a little less tolerant of blatant anti-LGBT humor. Both the movie and the character are happy to dangle Ryan Reynolds as fleeting gaybait, in order to excuse the actual ways it represents such tired stereotypes as hypersexed queer men, references to gay sex acts as ways to humiliate men, and depicting women who are not cisnormatively attractive as evil compared to conventionally hot women. Despite its makers touting the title characters pansexuality, and at least one outlet calling the movie progressive, Deadpool trades on well-worn anti-LGBT tropes, repackaged to be palatable to mainstream audiences. In one sense, trans people in Hollywood movies are better-off now than we were 25 years ago. Male characters in such movies (at least for now), no longer puke at the mere discovery of someones trans identity. But in another sense, the more things change the more things stay the same. Trans people continue to be jokey plot devices, rather than full-fledged human beings. This may not change until trans people themselves have the opportunity to write and direct blockbuster Hollywood comedies in the future maybe ones that depict how hilarious it is when cisgender men publicly revile trans women, but often privately go to absurd lengths to try to sleep with them. Theres a scenario, so common in life yet unrepresented in mainstream movies, that is truly ripe for comedy. CORRECTION The character of Hansel in Zoolander 2 is played by Owen Wilson.

aS"Especially in Africa and everywhere this goes out to you. View this image  youtube.com / Via youtube.com A group of LGBT artists in Kenya calling itself Art Attack came together to record a remix of Macklemore and Ryan Lewiss Same Love addressing homophobia in Africa. The accompanying music video was banned by Kenyas Film Classification Board one week after it appeared online earlier this month. All the artists involved in making the video are LGBT, said Jojibaro Barasa, an activist and singer who appears in the video. Most of the musicians didnt want to be named out of fear of reprisals, Barasa said in message to BuzzFeed News, and he and others in the video have received threats since the video premiered. We wanted to tell real stories using real gays and lesbians, Barasa told BuzzFeed News. We felt we have to continue talking about our rights because they were still being violated. Footage in the video references the anti-LGBT legislation in neighboring Uganda, an anti-LGBT march in Kenyas capital, Nairobi, and even last years pride march in Istanbul, Turkey, which police shut down with water canons. Though no sustained anti-LGBT political campaign has taken hold in Kenya and the countrys courts have handed LGBT activists some victories, there have been efforts to target LGBT people using the justification that Kenya law criminalizes homosexuality. The Kenya Film Classification Board reportedly censored the video because it was shot without required licenses and it does not adhere to the morals of the country. The ban was not a surprise, Barasa said, but it came faster than expected. We have no apologies whatsoever because it took us a lot of courage and resources to put everything together, Barasa said. That is why the government was shaken to a point of releasing a press statement. To us the message reached home. youtube.com Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"More than 100 bills have been introduced in this years legislative session to protect religious freedom or allow people to refuse services based on their faith. In at least eight states, legislatures currently are advancing bills. View this image  AP / David Goldman In the first legislative session after the Supreme Court ruled for same-sex couples marriage rights, Republican-led capitols across the country are home to an unprecedented number of bills to protect religious freedom or allow people to deny services based on their faith. At least 105 bills were filed so far this year, more than double the number in 2015, according to data from the American Civil Liberties Union. None of this years bills have become law most legislative sessions are still in full swing but bills in eight states have picked up momentum, from Oklahoma to Georgia. Several have passed out of committee, while others have passed out of the full house or senate. Some proposals are mild, such as a bill in Florida that affirms the existing rights of clergy and churches to refuse to wed a couple. Other bills gaining traction, however, chart new ground. A measure in Georgia would give individuals a legal defense if they refuse service based on a religious objection. A bill in Mississippi seeks to protect someone who denies marriage-related goods or declines non-emergency medical services to a transgender person. In Oklahoma, a proposal would protect adoption agencies that turn away parents, and in Tennessee, a bill would provide immunity to counselors who turn away clients. A fifth of the bills filed this year reflect variations of the religious freedom laws approved last spring in Indiana and Arkansas. A summary of the bills moving forward is below. Advocates for the measures say they are resisting a tectonic encroachment on their free speech and exercise of religion particularly in light of bans on same-sex couples marriages being struck down this past June and nondiscrimination laws that lack exemptions for people of faith. Lawmakers have stepped up to shore up freedoms we have always had as Americans, because they understand those freedoms are at risk, Greg Scott, a spokesman for the Alliance Defending Freedom, told BuzzFeed News. Scott, whose group provides support to lawmakers working on religious freedom bills, added, The stakes have never been higher and the intentions of those who oppose religious freedom have never been clearer. But LGBT advocates, who have been trying to stymie the bills by teaming up with pro-LGBT businesses, argue religion is being used as a guise to promote discrimination. As the opposition has fewer issues left to stand on, they are now turning to religious refusals, and, more dangerously, anti-transgender bills as their last stand against the LGBT community, Dan Rafter, a spokesman for the group Freedom for All Americans, said in an interview with BuzzFeed News. As a result, he said, The level of activity this legislative session is unprecedented. People are allowed to have their own religious beliefs, and that is why they are already so strongly protected, but you cant impose them on others, especially if that means denying them services like denying access to a homeless shelter or access into a restaurant. House Bill 757 was among the mildest of eight religious freedom bills introduced in Georgia this year. But in a sudden twist, it transformed into a lightning rod. The house originally passed the bill Feb. 11 as a so-called Pastor Protection Act, which would affirm existing rights of clergy and religious organizations to refuse services that clash with their faith. Those rights are widely considered already guaranteed by laws on the books and the Constitution. However, a senate committee last week broadly amended the bill. The full senate on Feb. 19 approved a version that would also ban government from penalizing an individual or faith-based organization for acting in accordance with their religious opposition to same-sex marriage. Rafter and other LGBT advocates contend this would give people and groups carte blanche to refuse services to gay couples, and that the bills definition of a faith-based organizations is so ambiguous that it may encompass for-profit businesses that express a religious point of view. But it is unclear which version, if any, will become law. Because the house and senate bills are so different, the house would need to affirm the senates expanded version and house leaders are holding back. Businesses and LGBT groups have leaned on Republican House Speaker David Ralston to block the new version. However, Kaleb McMichen, a spokesman for Ralston, told BuzzFeed News that religious conservatives also applied counter-pressure. McMichen said the house is likely to approve a compromise between the two versions of the bill before adjourning on March 24. Like most things, he said, I think it is going to be somewhere in the middle. House Bill 1523 is a broad proposal to protect the rights of those who oppose marriage equality and believe sex should be restricted to married straight couples while also protecting those opposed to recognizing the gender identity of transgender people. The Mississippi House passed it on Feb. 19; it is now in the senate. The 13-page measure prohibits the government from discriminating against people for acting on their religious convictions. In defining discriminating, the bill says government could not fine, withhold loans, give bad grades, refuse to hire, or take dozens of other retaliatory acts against individuals acting on their faith. The measure would protect, among others, people who deny services at a business, refuse marriage-related goods, and refuse non-emergency medical services to transgender people. The government also could not penalize a religious organization for denying housing, employment, or services. Senate Bill 1556 and House Bill 1840 would give counselors and therapists immunity from liability if they refuse service to someone whose behaviors conflicts with their religious beliefs. The senate passed its bill on Feb. 17, including an exemption in cases when clients are in imminent risk of harming themselves or others. A house committee is scheduled to take up the measure on March 1. House Bill 4012 is a Religious Freedom Restoration Act, known as a RFRA, that has passed the house and has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Much like a federal law of the same name, the bill says the government may not substantially burden a persons right to exercise of religion unless the government has a compelling reason and uses the least restrictive means possible. Twenty-one states already have variations on RFRAs on the books. LGBT advocates have raised concern about these laws, but it is not clear they would provide a successful case against discrimination complaints particularly those that mirror the narrowly written federal law. But, LGBT advocates say, it is unclear how the laws could be interpreted by courts. A senate committee passed SB 180 on Thursday, just one week after it was introduced. The fast-moving legislation would protect people who provide creative services such as wedding cakes or floral arrangements and apparently override the eight local ordinances in Kentucky that ban LGBT discrimination. Specifically, the proposal builds on the states RFRA. It says that no ordinance or public agency shall restrict the rights of people who provide customized, artistic, expressive, creative, ministerial, or spiritual goods or services. As WCPO reported, The bill comes after the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Human Rights Commission ordered a Christian T-shirt company to get diversity training for refusing to print shirts for a gay pride festival. A state judge overturned the order, but an appeals court is reviewing the case. The bill now heads to the full senate, which some believe will vote on the measure by next week. Missouri lawmakers are attempting to place a constitutional amendment on the ballot with Senate Joint Resolution 39, which had its first committee hearing on Wednesday. If the bill is passed by the legislature and the amendment is approved by voters, the legislation would protect individuals and religious organizations from activities that clash with their faith. The state cannot penalize an individual who declines, due to sincere religious beliefs, to provide goods of expressional or artistic creation for a same sex wedding ceremony, says a bill summary, which adds that religious organizations could not be penalized for refusing to perform a same-sex couples wedding or refusing to allow one on its property. A couple companion bills moving through the Florida legislature would affirm the right of clergy and religious organizations to deny services based on their religious beliefs. Both Senate Bill 110 and House Bill 43 are out of committee and appear to be heading to floor votes next week. House Bill 2428 says the state could not deny contracts to religious adoption agencies which typically receive taxpayer funding even if they turn away parents due to a religious objection. Specifically, according to a legislative analysis, The measure provides that no state agency may refuse to contract or enter into an agreement with a child welfare service provider because the provider declines to provide or refer for a child welfare service that conflicts with the providers religious beliefs or moral convictions . It was passed by Feb. 16 by the Children, Youth and Family Services Committee and now heads to the full house. Michigan approved a similar law last June. Eunice Rho, advocacy and policy counsel for the ACLU, which has tracked the bills, disagreed. The pattern is crystal clear, she said in a statement. These bills are all aimed at chipping away at the rights of LGBT people under the false guises of freedom and safety. Scott, from Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), countered that people characterizing the bills as anti-LGBT are wrong. There has never been a right to coerce someone, particularly an artist or creative professional, to produce speech or participate in the celebration of events that burden their consciences, he wrote in an email to BuzzFeed News. The introduction of same-sex marriage, as religious freedom and freedom of conscience advocates like ADF have long warned, has already led to a tectonic shift in many areas of law and policy related to religious freedom and free speech.

aS"Weve heard a lot from politicians this week, but no one bothered to ask the kids. View this image  Brosko / Getty Images Weve heard a lot from politicians, lobbyists and activists this week about the Safe Schools Coalition program, but we havent heard much from the young LGBT people who may have benefited from it. Heres what they have to say about growing up queer in Australia. I havent come out to anyone in real life but all my friends [online] know Im transgender. Most my friends are a part of LGBT+, too. Weve had slurs used against us, watched teachers tell a lesbian couple to stop holding hands while heterosexual couples hug and kiss a few metres away from them. The use of slurs in an everyday environment and the lack of teachers calling out students for using said words irks me, too. I told a classmate not to use tranny and she ended up pitting all her friends against me. - Scout, 15. View this image  Brosko / Getty Images When I was younger I wanted nothing more than just to fit in. We moved around quite a bit and when youre always the new kid you want nothing more than to feel like you belong somewhere. Just as I was hitting the developing stages of puberty, we immigrated to Australia and I had to start high school somewhere new. My family is quite Catholic and I went to a Catholic high school, so from the start there was already a set notion of what the right relationships are and what the right attractions were. I saw gay kids being bullied, and faggot or poofter being thrown around every couple of minutes, and it just created this idea in my head that this was a bad thing to be. By year ten, naturally I was a mess. Id spent my whole life in this culture and it was chipping away at me bit by bit. I started thinking about hurting myself and committing suicide to just end all the conflict inside my head. I was so lonely and isolated, I was too scared to talk to my friends and couldnt show any signs to my parents because I dont know how they would react (to this day Im still not out to them). I felt like I was about to explode and just needed help, thank god I spoke to one of the school counsellors (who had previously been my English teacher) and she helped through this horrific time. I know that without a doubt that counsellor saved my life. But I could only speak to her because she had been my teacher before and she was really tiresome in finding out what was truly bothering me. I dont know what wouldve happened to me if I didnt ask for help or went to a different counsellor who was prejudiced against LGBT people or who was deeply religious. So when I hear about new initiatives like the Safe Schools Coalition, Im grateful that theres a program out there helping young kids - both LGBT and non-LGBT alike - understand what its like to be different and to never feel ashamed of who they are. If it helps just one lost kid out there start accepting themselves before they get to the brink like I was, surely were doing something right? - Michael, 20-years-old View this image  Brosko / Getty Images I came out to my guidance counsellor in year 12 at high school. I went to a deeply Catholic college in Mornington, Victoria. I would say its a pretty conservative area, mostly white and mostly liberal. In my second session with her she expressed her concern for my condition and told me it was a phase. After some argument and a lot of confusion I told her it wasnt a phase and she concluded that it would be better for my life and my familys life if I didnt come out and just lived a normal life.So for the next six years I tried to be normal. I dated guys and developed horrendous anxiety and depression. In the 6th year (age 23) I decided enough was enough and came out I immediately felt a weight off my shoulders!!! My friends were amazing, my family suspected and didnt care as long as I was happy and I am now a very happy person living my true life!!! - Courtney View this image  Brosko / Getty Images I didnt learn the word transgender until I was 17 after stumbling on it on YouTube. By that time Id gone through an irreversible puberty that was completely wrong for who I am. Despite my parents and friends being such a support in most areas of my life, they couldnt understand what I was going through and talking through my emotions and feelings inevitably became awkward and emotionally distressing. It took me years to finally research, discover and put words to my experiences and by that time I was an adult and had had years of my life taken up by needless anxiety, depression and feelings of loneliness. Id had to stop doing sport and extra curricular activities while my academic study suffered as I became extremely sick at the age of 16. It wasnt being trans that made me feel so isolated at school it was the fact that I did not have the freedom or support to be myself. If I or if any of the people around me had had the knowledge or understanding of LGBT experiences, then I honestly believe that I would not have struggled so much with my own identity. Now surrounded by amazing support. - Rory, 20, a transgender man View this image  Brosko / Getty Images I was very lucky in a sense when I came out. My parents and all of my closest friends were very supportive. I didnt experience constant bullying from others during school but there were a few times that I felt very insecure about expressing who I was to others. I think the worst experience I had while at school was after an 18th party and someone had started a rumor that I taken advantage of highly intoxicated (straight) girl when all I did was try to help her sober up, held her hair back when she puked and was a shoulder for her to lean on when she passed out. None of her friends bothered to help her that night so I did. When I got to school on the Monday I felt like all eyes were on me, everyone was talking about me behind my back and saying that what I did was disgusting and could be classified as rape. When I eventually couldnt take anymore I told some teachers what was going on, a few were very helpful but some just didnt know what to do or how to handle the situation and told me that maybe I just shouldnt be so nice to other girls if I dont want things to spread. This then lead me to rethink every interaction I had with another female while I was at school. I was scared to say the normal I like your hair/nails/makeup today because I was terrified that they would somehow take it as me confessing my love for them. This also didnt help the anxiety issues I was already experiencing due to the stress of VCE. - Abbie, 18, identifies as gay View this image  Brosko / Getty Images Im 19 this year, and Im still not comfortable coming out to everyone in my life. Ive known I was different since I was about 10, but it wasnt until I was 16 that I realised I might like girls as well as liking boys. It was at the beginning of 2013, and I realised that I might like girls when I saw this girl (who up until now I just thought of as a friend that I wanted a closer relationship to) come down the stairs and grin at me, and my heart started thumping really hard and I felt like my stomach was trying to come out of my mouth. I tried to repress it a little, but I ended up coming out to one of the mothers at my dance school before I told anyone else. She made it very clear to me that what I felt was okay, and completely normal, and that I shouldnt ever try and push down any emotion, no matter what it was. This was hard for me to understand at first, because in my health class in year 9, the only thing that I remember was our teacher telling my entire class not to come out in high school, because kids were cruel and you were just inviting people to bully you. That teachers statement has stuck with me throughout the years, and its only in the past few months or so that Ive felt comfortable coming out to people outside my immediate family. - Hannah View this image  Brosko / Getty Images Personally, my experiences at school havent been touched by Safe Schools, but I think that provides a bit of evidence as to why they are so important. I havent experienced any outright explicit homophobia; which makes me one of the lucky few. This said, internalised societal homophobia is rife in schools, and the environment around me at the time I felt ready to come out pushed me back further into the closet. Whilst I had grown to accept my identity, mostly after pioneers of the gay community spoke out about their experiences, many online, I still felt as though those around me wouldnt be accepting. As school captain of my high school, I felt as though if I told even my closest friends my identity, that it would spread around the school, ending in the platform I had being taken away from me. In the beginning of my high school, almost every day Id have an accusation that I was gay, which sort of solidified in my mind that my identity was a negative thing, something that I should furiously deny, which I did. Even after I came out to my parents at the end of year 10 I was still reluctant to come out to many people at school; the traditional masculine straight boy groups were still causing me fear for the next six months. Sex ed in years 8 and 9 completely ignored the idea that perhaps there were LGBT students in the class, focusing purely on heterosexual relationships, something that obviously impacts on my relationships now. The worst instance of homophobia Ive heard from people around me was aimed at my boyfriend, who attends a private school. He entered the bathroom at his school, and heard a couple of guys say hey its [name], lets get out of here!, upon which they then ran out of the bathroom. You can only imagine how these same guys would react upon seeing a trans guy enter their bathroom. Safe Schools is important because we need to be able to express our sexuality at school. We need to be able to feel comfortable about who we are whilst at school, with our families and in general. Schools are the place where we are meant to find ourselves, where we are meant to feel comfortable and make friends, but without programs advocating for inclusion and acceptance, there will still be kids who experience homophobia and transphobia. These issues can no longer be seen as lesser, these are issues at the forefront of the civil rights fight of our generation, and we cant let homophobic conservative politicians dictate to us the value of our identities. - Brady, 17, identifies as gay. View this image  Brosko / Getty Images I figured out I wasnt straight when I was about 14, but I didnt feel comfortable with it until I left high school. My school wasnt super conservative, but didnt have support systems for LGBTQIA kids either. I probably learnt more about sexuality and gender from Glee than I did from six years of high school. It wasnt even that people were intentionally homophobic, but that friends would say stuff that they didnt realise was hurtful. One of my friends was even outed without their consent. I only felt comfortable with who I was at when I started uni and found the queer collective. - Roison, 19, identifies as bisexual. View this image  Brosko / Getty Images One time in grade 10 when I had a crush on a girl and didnt really deny it, a group of boys found me, cornered me, and called me a dyke over and over again. When I was in grade 6, which was when I was just starting to explore my attraction towards girls, when this guy caught me staring at this girl I liked in class and he turned to his friends and imitated me staring at this girl. He called out to her and told her in front of the entire class. Growing up, I always felt that I was never learning about me. It was always about a man and a woman, never ever about anything to do with queer people. It took me a long time to figure out who I was sexuality-wise, and when I came out when I was 16, nobody could relate to me. Im lucky because we live in a world where coming out is accepted, but I never felt like I had heaps of people to talk to and look up to. Its almost as if we were left to decide for ourselves without having both sides of the story. Instead of knowing I was queer since I started my education I was taught how to be straight and I hated myself. After I came out, people heard what I had to say, said cool and then left it at that. There was never any conversation about it and nobody would talk openly about questioning their sexuality because we were taught to be straight or be silent. - Sophie, 18, identifies as bisexual. View this image  Brosko / Getty Images The majority of the issues I faced throughout school were based purely around a lack of knowledge and an excess amount of fear. Anything that can educate people and cut down the fear of the unknown is something all schools should require. I once got into an argument with someone about football, and they ended up calling me a dyke for disagreeing with them - it wasnt about whether I liked girls or not, it was about humiliating me. Teachers starting and leading discussions about trannies in male prisons, and laughing when an argument between students began. Conversations about same-sex marriage and LGBT couples adopting would take place with no thought about whether any LGBT kids were in the classroom, and how theyd feel when freedom of speech was more important than making them feel comfortable in their own school. - Kelsey, 18, identifies as gay. View this image  Brosko / Getty Images I grew up in the relatively new outer Canberra suburb of Calwell. It was as this suburb grew that I grew into a young person. I was to the outside world a lanky, geeky, pubescent male with all the hallmarks of someone you expect to be playing dungeons and dragons at lunchtime. This was my youth. It was not fantastic or is something I choose to visit often. My primary issue throughout high school (and primary school for that matter) was bullying. Due to the fact I never really showed any interest in anyone (male or female) and my dislike of almost all sporting activities meant it was assumed I was gay. I was bullied. Bad. I remember being told I was gay or a tranny, or something similar since I was about 13. I remember people chasing me down the corridor to hit me for in any way appearing gay. I remember one day being told I was gay by another student at a party I went too. So strong was their conviction I was gay that they even gave the evidence that they had seen me hugging another boy. I of course didnt respond. I was taught, rightly or wrongly, that defending yourself against bullies would mean they got bored and stopped. Bullies took that response as a challenge. The boy I was hugging was a friend who had just been told his sister had been raped by their uncle for the last three years. When she [the sister] finally came back to school, she herself was called a lesbian. I went into a deep depression at this stage. Wandering the school in a sort of stupor at lunch and recess. Ignoring my friends. Ignoring everyone. This wasnt the first time, but this was the worst. Clearly being gay, or trans, or a lesbian meant you were in for a life of cruelty. The one thing that really drove this idea into my young adolescent brain was when I was crash tackled outside in one of the depressive wanderings and had deodorant sprayed on me by a gang of other students and then someone tried to set me alight. All the time they called me gay fag. At the end of the day I went home and tried to kill myself. The next day I went to school again, and hoped that I could report this incident. I did so and it turned our that my main attackers were not even from my school. They had been told of me by students from my school and helped to find me. They attacked me on school property then left. No one would admit to even the relatively minor (in the school welfare officers mind) crime of supporting them. I was on my own. So I kept my darkest secret, that I liked to cross dress and I wanted to be female, a very closely guarded secret. Lest their be a similar incident. It wasnt until years of repression, secret cross dressing, and lying to myself that I finally came out as a trans women to my friends and family. And I have never been happier in myself. I really hope that there is another kid out there like me who is able to actually feel safe at school being who they are, and that people realise that they are important and should be safe. - Anne, Canberra *Some of these stories have been edited for clarity.

aS"The school, which made headlines as a symbol of Indonesias religious pluralism, has been closed amid an unprecedented wave of anti-LGBT rhetoric in the country. View this image  Students at the Al-Fatah Pesantren, during Eid al-Fitr celebrations, August 12, 2015. Ulet Ifansasti / Getty Images A Muslim academy for transgender women that made headlines in the U.S. and Europe since opening in 2008 was closed on Thursday by officials in Indonesias Yogyakarta region following protests by an organization calling itself the Islamic Jihad Front. The head of the local jurisdiction home to the school, known as the Al Fatah Pesantren, confirmed its closure to BuzzFeed News on Friday. It is the latest development in an uproar over LGBT rights that began in January, which has caught the countrys LGBT activists by surprise. Until last month, anti-LGBT rhetoric was not a major feature of politics in Indonesia, which is home to more Muslims than any nation in the world. The country has long been home to a community of transgender women known as waria, and the school which has about 40 students has received so much attention in the Western press in part because it symbolized pluralism and strands of progressive Islam that distinguished Indonesias religious life. The storm over LGBT issues began in January when the minister with oversight of higher education pronounced LGBT student groups to be incompatible with standards of values and morals expected at the countrys universities. Though some political leaders appear to have tried to quiet the uproar, others are eagerly pouring flames on the fire. On Monday, Defense Minister Ryamizard Ryacudu suggested the LGBT community is more dangerous than nuclear weapons, because it skews the mindset of our nation away from our base ideology. On Friday, former Information and Communications Minister Tifatul Sembering, who now is an MP from the Islamist Prosperous Justice Party, tweeted, A saying of the Prophet [Mohamed]: Whomever you find committing the acts of the community of Lot (homosexual) should be put to death, though he later deleted the tweet. Until this year, the Al Fatah Pesantren operated without major problems, according to the schools director, Shinta Ratri, who spoke to BuzzFeed News by phone this week. In fact, she said, the countrys waria community wasnt even perceived as connected to gays and lesbians nor the activists with ties to international LGBT organizations. Before people still understood that waria is separate from LGBT, but now even us waria have been becoming part of the LGBT, she said. They had never had trouble with the Islamic Jihad Front, an organization founded around the same time as the school that claims 150 members. The organizations purpose is to improve the publics understanding of Islam and tackle social disease, said a man known as Darohman in Indonesian and Abu Dzaki in Arabic in a phone interview with BuzzFeed News. He is the leader of the groups militia which also has taken action to shut down a karaoke bar, harass Shiite muslims, and close a Christian church supposedly operating without a proper license, according to the groups website. Last Friday morning, Darrohman told Buzzfeed News, the group broadcast a text message to its members that read, We invite all Muslim Brothers to REFUSE and SHUTTER the school. It was called an Invitation to uphold what is right and rejecting what is wrong. Darrohman told BuzzFeed News the group moved on the waria school because theyd heard the group was working on drafting fiqih codes on religious obligations for transgender women, and wanted an official explanation. The schools organizers had heard about the text message before a group of 20 FJI members showed up, and the students of the school had fled to an office of a legal aid organization, Shinta said, and the local police responded to protect the school. We will provide security without any time limit; this is my territory, the local police commander, Suharno, said to CNN Indonesia. We will also deploy [officers] to watch every day, every second to do security. But on Thursday, a local official announced that they would close the school and ban religious activities on the grounds citing concerns about public order, the Jakarta Post reported. The head of the local government, Jati Bayubroto of the Bangun Papan subdistrict of Bantul, Yogyakarta, told BuzzFeed News by phone that the school was also facing complaints from neighbors over issues like noise and congestion when they held events. It meant in a house belonging to Shintas relative and the neighbors said it also hosted karaoke and served alcohol. But, he said, the neighbors were also afraid that they would be targeted by groups like the FJI. For almost two years, people have been tolerant to the activities at the house of Ibu Shintas relative, he said. But when the situation is threatening security, they are afraid something could happen in the neighborhood. They demand the closure of the place. In addition, they are also afraid that their activities could negatively affect the local kids. The decision to close the school followed a meeting organized by local officials between the FJI and the schools organizers, which a lawyer for the school told the Jakarta Post was rigged against the school. The FJIs pressure is not a legal regulation that must be followed, the lawyer, Aditia Arief Firmanto, told the paper. Shinta declined to speak to reporters after the meeting, telling the Jakarta Post by text message, I am psychologically tired. But she vowed she would continue fighting to provide religious instruction to her students when she spoke to BuzzFeed News earlier in the week. I will not give up to provide facility to our friends in the waria community to worship, to practice the Islamic way, she said. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Mardi Gras is more than glitter and sequins. View this image  Tracey Nearmy / AAPIMAGE / Anna Mendoza It was a freezing night in June 1978 when a group of Sydneys queer activists gathered at Taylor Square in the heart of Sydneys gay district. The Oxford Street bars were crowded on the ninth anniversary of New Yorks famous Stonewall Riots, which began the gay liberation movement in the United States. As the group marched down Oxford Street toward Hyde Park hundreds of people streamed out of the nearby gay bars to join. Out of the bars! Into the streets! they chanted as the group of around 500 swelled to 2000 (much to the chagrin of the bar owners). Soon the crowd reached a police line at College Street. The marchers had permission to be there, but police wanted the party to end. The keys to the van leading the march were confiscated and the music was shut off. The marchers made their way - Like the charging of the bulls - up William Street towards Kings Cross. They didnt want any trouble, they insist, but police met them at the other end anyway, and a brutal, bloody riot ensued. We thought it was going to be a parade. We thought it was going to be a good fun time, an opportunity to be out, to show who we were in terms of our sexuality, not to be hidden in some closet somewhere, says Sandy Banks, one of the original 78ers - the name given to those first Mardi Gras marchers. I thought, Lets have some fun! Some fun! Little did I know about the trouble wed end up in. It was just abominable. Banks says the police came from all sides and converged on the famous El Alemein fountain. It was then that it absolutely turned. The lights from the paddywagons. The lights from the houses in The Cross. It was just full on. The noise levels were overwhelming, Sandy says. There were the old tin garbage bins with the lids. So people were picking them up. They were flying across the streets. That was very, very dangerous. Sandy was arrested, picked up and thrown in the back of a paddy wagon. The bruises would be visible for weeks. Fairfax Media As man is carried away by police following the first Mardi Gras march. Pic: Fairfax. They werent yet marching for things like marriage equality, adoption rights or family benefits. Their aim was something much simpler but infinitely more important. They wanted to be recognised as people. Homosexual sex was still illegal in NSW and would remain so for another six years. It was the one opportunity we thought we had to actually say, Here we are. Were not afraid. Were out here and this is who we are. And were not going to live our lives in a closet, Sandy says. 52 others were arrested alongside Sandy. They spent the night in the freezing old Darlinghurst jail as her fellow marchers gathered on the outside, chanting and screaming for the release of their friends. There were 20 of us shoulder-to-shoulder. That was comforting. There were two blankets thrown in and there was no bottled water or anything. There was a large tin of water for us to have. It was just primitive. Eventually charges were dropped against all but a few of the rioters. A few days later the Sydney Morning Herald published the names, addresses and occupations of everyone arrested, in the full knowledge that many of them would lose their jobs after being publicly outed. This week, Fairfax offered a qualified apology. In 1978, The Sydney Morning Herald reported the names, addresses and professions of people arrested during public protests to advance gay rights. The paper at the time was following the custom and practice of the day, SMH editor Darren Goodsir said. We acknowledge and apologise for the hurt and suffering that reporting caused. It would never happen today. On Thursday, the NSW government formally said sorry for the way the marchers were treated. For the mistreatment you suffered, as a member of this parliament which oversaw the events of that night, I apologise and say Im sorry, government MP Bruce Notley-Smith said as the 78ers watched on from the public gallery. The actions you took on June 24 1978, the pain and suffering meted out to you on that night and afterwards was undeserved. On that evening, you lit a flame under the gay rights movement in Sydney that burned its way to law reform and acceptance. View this image  Jane Dempster / AAPIMAGE While the violence from that night has, thankfully, never been reenacted, the battles being fought by Australias LGBT community are far from over. From the AIDS crisis and police brutality of the 80s to the political activism of the 90s and todays battle for marriage equality and transgender rights, Mardi Gras has always been an opportunity for people who have been pushed to the fringes of society to take centre stage for one night a year. But that doesnt mean the parade hasnt faced significant criticism. At the peak of the AIDS crisis in the 80s, there were calls for the whole thing to be shut down. In 1994 the parade was broadcast on television for the first time, bringing the ABC its best ever Sunday night ratings and drawing a new level of national attention to the parade. Its been through several identity crises. In the 90s there was anger over the inclusion of bisexual and heterosexual marchers, while in 2011 Mardi Gras organisers faced criticism for removing the words Gay and Lesbian from its name. After a backlash, the name was restored. At times the parade has been criticised as either too commercial, too sexual or too far away from where it began - as a place for political activism and to agitate for LGBT advancement. Last year conservative commentator Andrew Bolt was exasperated to learn that there was no anti-ISIS float in the parade. Sandy Banks herself has done her best to avoid the march since that freezing night in 1978. I didnt like the commercialism. I thought, I have no interest here. I dont have any common platform with whats being promoted. And so therefore Im not going to come, she says. View this image  Dan Himbrechts / AAPIMAGE By far the loudest opposition to the parade - the yin to the 78ers yang - is NSW MP Reverend Fred Nile. Perhaps Australias most famous religious conservative, the reverend has spent his life fighting against the forces of immorality - and since 1979, one of his favourite targets has been the Mardi Gras. Mardi Gras, and Niles annual denunciations of the event, have become so intertwined its hard to imagine one without the other. Like clockwork, each year Nile prays for rain over the parade route in an attempt to keep revellers away from the festivities. [When asked by BuzzFeed News if hes ever considered that the scantily clad, fit gay men who make up many of the parades numbers wont mind getting a bit wet, he replies that its not just about the marchers. Im sure it doesnt bother them at all. But I know it does upset the floats. A lot of it is made of soft material so it does some damage.] But it hasnt always been this way. Nile says he was broadly supportive of the marchers anger at police in 1978. It was a protest around the way theyd been treated by the police, and I understand that. I wasnt against the protest march, he says. His opposition to the event began the next year, and hasnt abated since. Central to it is his belief that the parade is used as a recruitment tool to encourage the gay lifestyle. [Mardi Gras] has had a big influence on public opinion, and the views of young people and so on, who are exposed to it. And that does concern me, he says. View this image  Peter Parks / AFP / Getty Images Nile also objects to nudity and blasphemy that he says makes up so much of the march, and argues police should uphold the same standards they would uphold on the other 364 nights of the year. Nile claims police have told him that on any other night, many marchers would be fined for the way theyre dressed, but on Mardi Gras they get a free pass. Every group in society has a right in a democracy, if they wish to have a march or a parade as long as they uphold the community standards and the state law as to what can happen on the public streets of Sydney. On that front, Nile isnt alone. Last year, a widely-shared piece written by gay Sydney journalist Gavin Fernando, said the parade made him less proud to be a gay man. I dont understand the abundance of glitter. I dont understand the hairy near-naked blokes grinding and wrestling in crotch-tight spandex at Fair Day, or swinging on float poles. I dont understand the undeniable fact that sex glorious as it is is everywhere you look, walk and breathe. I mainly dont understand the implication that Im automatically connected to this display by means of my sexual orientation, he wrote. View this image  Mitchell Burke / NEWZULU Arguments against the parades commercialism havent gone away either. Among the sponsors this year will be the ANZ bank, Facebook and the state of NSW. Its a long way from the radical queer activists marching simply to be recognised as human beings. Today, activists say the sponsorship is nice, but it shouldnt be used to turn the focus of Mardi Gras away from important issues. Were talking about multinational corporations who do big business with a lot of other countries around the world that are not LGBTI supportive, or more than that theyre actually openly discriminatory if not violent, Nic Holas, a queer activist and writer, wrote for Fairfax last year. Its all very good to say yes, were inclusive and yes were pro marriage equality and we love the gays but if theyre directly profiting off work with other nations that are doing the exact opposite thats pink washing. Marketing is effective when it comes to making corporates appear more human but the profit will always drive the decision-making process. All these factors have combined to give Mardi Gras something of an identity crisis. What is Mardi Gras in 2016? Given the significant advances in LGBT rights since 1978, is there really much left worth fighting for? In 2016, some of the loudest messages will be coming from transgender Australians, their families and friends. Marching for the first time will be Lisa Cuda, the mother of a transgender son. Im marching to show that I dont just have a transgender child, but I celebrate that child, I completely support them. I think Mardi Gras is a real celebration of diversity, and I really want that to be out in the public, she says. View this image  Supplied To critics who say Mardi Gras is no longer relevant as a political movement in 2016, Lisa says for her and her son, the battle is just beginning. She wants the world to know that trans Australians are still fighting for basic rights, like the ability to change a birth certificate or gain access to vital medical services. Its really important that we are visual, for the basic fact that we have been locked in basements and closets for too many generations, and now were not prepared to take a backseat in life, she says. It sends a very important message to the next generation that there are people in the community who are like them and are visible, and celebrated and proud. Another float making its way up Oxford Street is the No Pride In Detention float. Lead organiser Evan van Zijl told BuzzFeed News the float is designed to keep the political spirit of Mardi Gras alive. Theres this huge radical history thats contesting the idea that homophobia is something thats allowed to happen. Were reclaiming space, challenging society using the concept of pride. View this image  Dean Lewins / AAPIMAGE  A joint project from the Refugee Action Coalition, Community Action Against Homophobia and the Riff Raff Marching Band, the float intends to project the message that Australian asylum seeker policy is an explicitly queer issue. When we say They will never be settled here, what that means is settling them in PNG where homosexuality is criminalised, said van Zijl. Its time we stop assuming people on the ground are dumb, or dont care, or are middle of the road. Theyre not. They want change. Marching alongside Lisa and Evan this year will be Sandy. After avoiding the parade almost every year since 1978, she says shes realised that to be involved and send a message is more important than ever. Ive come to realise that being out and speaking up is actually some incentive to younger people, she says. The thing that I think is a positive now is that Mardi Gras is aimed at people right across the board. Its not aimed at the educated, its got working class roots. Theyre there in their thousands. Also, the different work groups like the police are there. And that is good. Not that I will ever forget my memory about the police. Ill never forgive being bashed the way I was. However, Ive realised too that times have changed. We are hopefully moving forward. There is still homophobia and bullying in workplaces. There are high rates of suicide, a lot of them young gay people in country and regional areas. As Sandy discusses the big issues that face the LGBT community today, theres still a hint of the queer revolutionary who took on police way back in 1978. Gay marriage is obviously what people are wanting at the moment. Im not a strong supporter of gay marriage, because I believe its just sort of replicating heterosexual behaviour and that we never, ever really wanted that. I never really wanted to be the same as everyone else. I just wanted to have our rights. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .

aS'The man was on Truvada, the once-a-day pill that prevents HIV, but contracted a drug-resistant strain of the virus. This landmark case shows that we cant rely too much on any one drug, experts say. View this image  Justin Sullivan / Getty Images For the first time ever documented, a person taking Truvada the once-a-day pill that prevents HIV infection in whats known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP has contracted a drug-resistant strain of the virus. The case was presented on Thursday at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) in Boston. The patient was a 43-year-old gay man from Toronto who had been on the daily drug regimen for 24 months with no previous issues. The study researchers noted that, according to pharmacy records as well as blood tests, the man had been taking the drug properly around the time that he contracted the virus. In general, Truvada is extremely effective in preventing HIV in those who take it every day. But the scientists concluded that there is an important, though very rare exception: someone who is exposed to a virus strain that is resistant to both drugs included in Truvada, tenofovir and emtricitabine. The Toronto man had sex with someone who carried a virus that was resistant to both of the drugs in Truvada, as well as others. I think the evidence that we have says that in general PrEP is working quite well, Richard Harrigan, director of research labs at the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV and one of the study researchers, told BuzzFeed News. But there are always exceptions, and we have to keep that in mind. The problem arises because we use the same drugs for prevention that we use for treatment, Harrigan said. In the ideal world, there wouldnt be any crossover between the drugs we use, but at this point we just dont have that many things that have been shown to work, he said. The man, who is now HIV-positive, is on antiretroviral therapy and has his infection under control, Harrigan said. Harrigan also cautioned that exposure to a strain of HIV thats resistant to just one of the drugs in Truvada might decrease the effectiveness of the pills. According to research done by his group, roughly 10% of the HIV-infected British Columbia population has emtricitabine resistance, and about 1% to 2% have tenofovir resistance. The issue of resistance is one thats been discussed at length with respect to PrEP, Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC, a global HIV-prevention advocacy group in New York City, told BuzzFeed News. But he noted that, for example, none of the 1,400 people taking PrEP in an ongoing study led by Kaiser Permanente San Francisco have contracted the virus. I think its certainly important evidence that needs to be understood, Warren said. I dont think it undercuts the important role PrEP can play. CORRECTION Roughly 10% of the HIV-infected British Columbia population, not the entire British Columbia population, has emtricitabine resistance.

aS"But LGBT rights groups say the package is discriminatory and vow to keep fighting in the streets and in the courts. View this image  A general view of the Italian Senate in Rome Tony Gentile / Reuters The Italian Senate signed off on legislation on Thursday creating a civil union status for same-sex couples after a bitter debate that dominated Italian politics for months. The vote was 173 in favor and 71 against, Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported.The bill must now must be approved by the Parliaments lower house, but it is expected to encounter much less resistance there than it did in the Senate. But if the legislation is adopted in its current form, it will not be an end to the fight over same-sex couples rights. The government of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi traded away provisions important to LGBT activists in order to clear the path for Thursdays vote, including a persons right to adopt the child of a same-sex partner. LGBT groups are vowing a new fight against Renzis ruling coalition and litigation challenging provisions that they see as discriminatory. Pontius Pilate could not have done better, a broad coalition of LGBT groups said in a statement denouncing the compromise issued shortly before the Senate vote, calling for a protest on March 5. If this bill is adopted, the groups said, would make Italy unlike almost any other country in [the European Union] and unique among its founding countries, [ignoring] completely the existence and needs of the sons and daughters of gay couples. Now our battle concluding the associations will continue in the streets and in the courts, they vowed. View this image  Supporters of same-sex civil unions demonstrate in Rome during the vote at the Italian Senate Filippo Monteforte / AFP / Getty Images The open wounds left by this fight will not only keep the battle alive in Italy, but could become a problem for major European institutions. Daniele Viotti, a member of the Parliament of the European Union from Italys ruling Democratic Party, said in a statement to BuzzFeed News that he was calling on the E.U.s executive body called the European Commission to enact regulations that would require member states to recognize adoptions and other public documents related to civil status from one another. The E.U. technically has no jurisdiction over family law in member states, but these issues affect freedom of movement for LGBT people throughout the continent which does fall under the E.U.s domain. I think Europe will ask Italy for more and I hope Italy will be ready for more, said Viotti, who is also co-president of the Parliaments LGBT rights caucus. Dropping stepchild adoption is dreadful because it leaves children without protection. The fight is not over. But Viotti said, the European Commission has become a lot more timid in pushing LGBT rights. The Commission is also now facing a grassroots effort by conservatives, called Mum, Dad, and Kids. The group is using a relatively new mechanism, installed to make the E.U. more democratic, to mount a petition drive to pressure the E.U. to define marriage as between a man and a woman. But the Italian civil union fight shows that national governments are increasingly willing to ignore the exhortations from the European Unions seat in Brussels and the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, said Grgor Puppinck. Puppinck is one of the organizers of the Mum, Dad, and Kids initiative and director of the Strasbourg-based European Center for Law and Justice, a Christian conservative group affiliated with Pat Robertsons American Center for Law and Justice. Maybe pressure from Brussels or Strasbourg are quickly diminishing in many aspects and I think one of the first aspects that are collapsing is the purely ideological power, Puppinck said. The E.U. is currently challenged by fundamental governance questions while countries including the United Kingdom and Russia are refusing to honor rulings of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), Puppinck said. To some extent we are witnessing collapse of the system. But Europes institutions hold some of LGBT activists best hope to push Italy forward. The ECHR helped force passage of the civil union bill with a ruling last July that Italy had violated same-sex couples rights by denying legal recognition, and some Italian activists are already contemplating how to get this legislation back before the courts. We will definitely start soon to plan new legal actions saying that the law is discriminatory, first of all for the children of same-sex couples, said Yuri Guaiana of the LGBT organization Certi Diritti and a board member of the International Lesbian and Gay Organizations European chapter. It goes against a lot of ECHR rulings, so were very positive on the chances of winning. It creates an institution thats exclusively for same-sex couples and we view it as a segregationist law. View this image  A banner reading its forbidden to scrap the family is seen during a Family Day rally Andreas Solaro / AFP / Getty Images But this challenge may be tricky, said Alexander Schuster, the lawyer who represented the same-sex couples in the ECHR suit decided in July. While the court has argued that same-sex couples have a right to legal status, it has repeatedly said states are not obligated to establish marriage equality. It has also held that states can restrict adoption only to married couples. Adoption suits that have succeeded in the ECHR have been when states give same-sex and opposite-sex couples in the same status different adoption rights, such as allowing opposite-sex couples in civil unions to adopt but barring same-sex couples in the same kind of civil union from doing so. Schuster said there is a case already making its way through the Italian courts that could set up this kind of challenge. Italian courts have granted adoptions outside of married couples in a narrow set of circumstances, and some courts in Rome have extended that logic to apply to same-sex couples. If those precedents get undone by the countrys top courts and a case recently decided by an appeals court could be appealed this could go to the ECHR. He thought the court would be leery of the political fallout of pushing existing precedent on LGBT rights despite expansive rhetoric found in some opinions. I think most European institutions are becoming very cautious, he said. But Puppinck of the European Center of Law and Justice said that he believed the ECHR was pushing an ambitious two-step strategy in its LGBT rulings: to first require all 47 states on the Council of Europe to at least provide civil unions for same-sex couples, and then to suppress all the differences between marriage and civil partnerships. The Italian vote is a sign that even in Western Europe many still reject the idea that children should be raised by same-sex couples, Puppinck said. What really we want on this issue [is that] we do not want the children to be the tools of the desires of the parents, he said. This is the ultimate [red] line.

It means I can finally be free of the chains that pinned me down for so long. Mason, trans man View this image  Being comfortable in your own skin is something I think many people struggle with, and for the transgender community its even tougher.

So now, whether I have long or short hair, top surgery or not, I am comfortable with the person on the inside, and its given me the best peace of all. Morgan, trans man View this image  To be comfortable in my own skin is everything to me. I feel free in living life the way I want to, not living life to please others.

aS"Daryll Rowe appeared in court to face 10 charges, including assault and rape, after five men came forward. View this image  Edinburgh Sheriff Court Google Maps A 25-year-old man has appeared in court in Edinburgh charged with a string of offences relating to the possible transmission of HIV to several other men, BuzzFeed News can reveal. Daryll Rowe faces 10 charges: four counts of rape and six of assault, all of which relate to events that are alleged to have taken place in Edinburgh in 2015. The rape charges denote that on each occasion consent for sex was given on the condition that a condom was used, and because it was allegedly not and, according to prosecutors, unbeknown to Rowes sexual partners it constitutes sexual intercourse by deception. This comes under the offence of rape in Scots law (Section 1 of the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009), according to the charges. View this image  The assault charges allege that Rowe had unprotected sex knowing he was HIV-positive and that the act carried a risk of transmitting the virus, and that he did not disclose his HIV status prior to sex taking place. This happened on six occasions with five different men, according to the prosecution. Four of those men were the same as those named in the rape charges. Their identities and anonymity are protected in law. Rowe first came before the Edinburgh sheriff court on 10 February. He did not enter a plea. Rowe was remanded in custody before a second court appearance what is known as the Full Committal on 18 February, at which he did not enter a plea and was released on bail. His arrest follows a six-month investigation by police in the Scottish capital.

aS"LGBTI asylum seekers face unique difficulties. View this image  Lane Sainty / BuzzFeed Hosted by the Uniting Network, a group for queer people and allies within the Uniting Church, the panel event discussed how Australian asylum seeker policy applies to LGBTI refugees. Triggs told the event about the bittersweet story of two men who met in a detention camp in Australia and fell in love. Today, they are detained on Manus, and they spend much of their day in their cabins as they fear sexual assault or worse, she said. Moreover of course, Papua New Guinea criminalises homosexual acts. There are 77 countries that still criminalise homosexual activity. View this image  Mick Tsikas / AAPIMAGE They are subject to decision makers who are very poorly trained in LGBTI issues. Triggs cited a case where an asylum seeker was asked if he used lubricant to have sex with his partner. After refusing to answer the question, the asylum seeker was deemed not credible. However, the question was later marked inappropriate under judicial review. Its the precise circumstances from which LGBTI refugees are fleeing that often prevents them from being able to present evidence of their LGBTI status, said Triggs. They have spent most of their lives in the countries from which they come concealing their LGBTI status, she said. They are not used to speaking to an officer theyve never met before, presenting evidence they see as deeply personal. A spokesperson for the Department of Immigration and Border Protection has previously told BuzzFeed News that no claims are accepted uncritically. The spokesperson said lesbian, gay and bisexual refugees are not asked for evidence of same-sex sexual activity. They may be asked for evidence of same-sex relationship/s and they may be asked questions about their gender identity and sexual orientation, they said. View this image  Ryan Pierse / Getty Images For people escaping persecution due to their sexual orientation, this means being questioned by an immigration officer about their sexual experiences, the number of relationships theyve had. Details of where they have had sex, the partners and places they would visit, said Bishop. Holding to Australias rigorous evidence standards, immigration officers seek inconsistencies in the asylum seekers claims. Bishop says this presents a particular difficulty for people who are bisexual, or have a fluid sexual or gender identity.

aS"Hint: Its still kinda shitty. View this image  Safe Schools Bullock today hit out at the program, telling The Australian it is too narrowly focused on gay issues, and that an anti-bullying program aimed at every student would suffice. View this image  AAP A recent study of young LGBT people found that 41% had thought about self-harm and/or suicide; 33% had harmed themselves; and 16% had attempted suicide. LGBT people of any age group have the highest rates of suicidality of any population in Australia. 20% of trans Australians and 15.7% of lesbian, gay and bisexual Australians report having suicidal thoughts, BeyondBlue found. Same-sex attracted Australians have up to 14 times higher rates of suicide attempts than their heterosexual peers. For same-sex attracted people under 30, the rate is six times higher. View this image  AAP Up to 80% of young LGBT people have experienced homophobic or transphobic bullying and violence, BeyondBlue found. 80% of this bullying occurs at school. The same study found 64% had been verbally abused, 18% physically abused, and 32% experienced other types of homophobia and transphobia. Schools are the most common site of bullying for LGBT kids. Its most likely to come from their peers, but some students also experience bullying from teachers. Significantly, when bullying or homophobia is reported to school teachers or managers, it is often not acted upon. View this image   Its common for young people to hide their sexuality from family, friends, peers and community. Although acceptance is growing, many young LGBT people leave home at 18 after coming out to their family. This often forces them into government housing, where many have negative experiences in dealing with government services and human welfare agencies, often citing a lack of recognition and respect. [LGBT young people] typically experienced multiple placements, often changing annually, some of which were satisfactory and many of which were not, each resulting in changing schools with significant interruptions to their education, resulting for some in uncompleted schooling, the report found. At school, coming out can mean becoming a target of bullying from students and teachers. LGBT young people say sports classes are the worst. Participants reported they were asked by PDHPE teachers to change their clothes in isolation from their peers. Students were often relegated to sports traditionally associated with their sex [netball for girls and football for boys], even if this did not interest the students or align with sporting preferences based on their chosen gender identities. View this image   LGBT students say sex education often focuses on a heteronormative view of society and only on reproductive sex. They also said sex education did not focus enough on sexual health, an issue that disproportionately effects the LGBT community. Participants in the study were regularly told that gay sex would lead to AIDS. One participant recalled receiving a booklet on safe sex that was about gay men only, cementing an association between gay and disease and HIV, AIDS and STIs. This is one issue the Safe Schools program is designed to address. View this image  AAP Particularly so for transgender people, who say its incredibly difficult to find work. Often, a young person applying for a job will be forced to use their birth name (called a deadname), even if that name does not correspond with their gender identity. View this image  AAP The mental health of LGBT people of all ages is among the poorest in the country, but as the age groups get lower, the levels of psychological distress rise. According to BeyondBlue, lesbian, gay and bisexual Australians are twice as likely to have a high/very high level of psychological distress as theirheterosexual peers. This makes them particularly vulnerable to mental health problems. The youngerthe age group, the starker the differences: 55% of LGBT women aged between 16 and 24 [have high levels of psychological distress] compared with 18% in the nation as a whole and 40% of LGBT men aged 16-24 compared with 7%. Elevated risks of mental health issues or suicidality are not due to sexuality, sex or gender identity themselves, but because of the discrimination and exclusion so often experienced by young LGBT people.

aS"The Charlotte City Council passed a bill to ban LGBT discrimination in a 7 to 4 vote on Monday night, which led to escalating threats from Gov. Pat McCrory and House Speaker Tim Moore, both Republicans, to override the city ordinance. View this image  North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory. AP / Cliff Owen The Charlotte City Council passed an LGBT nondiscrimination bill on Monday night in a 7 to 4 vote leading top North Carolina Republicans on Tuesday to threaten state legislation that would negate the city ordinance. Gov. Pat McCrory had told city officials in an email one day before the vote that state lawmakers may take immediate action to block Charlottes new policy. The states Speaker of the House, Tim Moore, followed up Tuesday morning to announce he would work with fellow Republicans to explore a legislative intervention to correct [Charlottes] radical course. Both leading Republicans argued the bill would present safety risks by allowing transgender people into restrooms that correspond with their gender identity. In a statement Tuesday afternoon, Gov. McCrory said legislators had told him they are planning a bill to block the LGBT nondiscrimination ordinance not only in Charlotte, but also in any other jurisdiction in the state that passed a similar policy. As I communicated and predicted prior to the vote, state legislative leaders have notified me about introducing legislation that would correct this misguided government regulation and ensure it will not happen in any town or city in North Carolina, McCrory said. I am disappointed and saddened Charlotte city government initiated overreaching regulations that change basic standards and expectations of privacy regarding restrooms and locker rooms, he added. As governor, he continued, I will support legislative action to address this regulation and will remain committed to protecting the privacy and safety of all men, women and children of all ages in North Carolina. My position is consistent with challenging government overreach by the federal, state and now a local government. Both McCrory and Moore declined to elaborated on how, specifically, such a bill would work. However, several sources told BuzzFeed News the state could follow in the steps of Arkansas, where legislators passed a bill last year that preempts local jurisdictions from enacting nondiscrimination policies that extend beyond state law. That sort of clash in North Carolina could tee up a rancorous partisan showdown that pits a state capitol run by Republicans against city hall controlled by Democrats. Furthermore, it could make Charlotte the latest flashpoint for the national LGBT movement, which has struggled to pass nondiscrimination laws since winning marriage equality at the Supreme Court last year. The Charlotte ordinance, which is slated to take effect in April, bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression in housing and places of public accommodation. (State law does not allow cities to ban workplace discrimination.) Charlotte City Councilmember John Autry supported the measure, telling BuzzFeed News before the vote it protects vulnerable citizens from discrimination. But if the state tried to challenge the law, he said, We have no legal leg to contest it with. Autry said North Carolina law empowers the state with strong control over jurisdictions, allowing it to preempt our authority. If the state wanted to, they could come here to the government center, fire all of us, send us home, and run the city themselves. We have a full house. Lots of people heading to the overflow space. #cltequality #clt #citycouncil More than 100 people packed a council hearing before the vote. Self-identified Christian conservatives, many furious, expressed fear the nondiscrimination law would allow transgender people and men posing as trans to sexually assault women in restrooms. They also worried about their religious freedom, saying the bill would force them to promote LGBT values in violation of their faith. One man dressed up as a king and waving a scepter mocked transgender people by proclaiming, I identify as gender royal Anyone who does not bow and call me your highness shall be fined. When the man refused to stop yelling, Mayor Jennifer Roberts threatened to have him removed from the room. She also asked anti-transgender speakers to show human decency. View this image  One woman compared transgender people to someone who thinks they are a bird or cat, while another compared transgender people to drivers traveling the wrong direction on freeways. In contrast, a transgender woman told the council she was afraid to be there, while others said LGBT rights were part of a decades-long civil rights movement. Supporters of the bill said perverted characterizations of transgender people only underscored the need to protect transgender people from discrimination. Conservative people, led by a lot of religious factions, have tried to characterize transgender people as sex offenders, perverts, pedophiles, or all of the above, Councilmember Autry said in phone call before the vote. Show me the evidence that supports your assertion. I havent seen it. I think its about discrimination, and if you can deny the rights of our most vulnerable citizens, then you can just as easily work to deny the rights of other factions. There are no documented cases in the 17 states and 225 other cities with such laws on the books of people using the policies for nefarious purposes, but the bathroom attack has been a potent argument for blocking and repealing LGBT nondiscrimination laws. Last fall voters in Houston, Texas, repealed the citys nondiscrimination bill and just this month the city council in Jacksonville, Florida, withdrew a similar bill. The assembly in Anchorage, Alaska, passed a similar law and citizens are attempted to repeal it. In all of those cities, as in Charlotte, critics hammered on a message that the nondiscrimination ordinance would allow transgender women who they tend to describe as men to sexually prey in women by claiming they are protected on the basis of gender identity in public restrooms and locker rooms. That was also a leading argument in South Dakota, which last week became the first state to pass a bill banning transgender students from using restrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their gender identity. The bill awaits the governors signature. In North Carolina, Gov. McCrory contended in his email that the ordinance tried to solve a problem that does not exist, adding that the bill may create major public safety issues by allowing a person with male anatomy, for example, to use a female restroom. The bathroom issue was also flashpoint in Charlotte last year, when the council narrowly rejected a similar bill. Since then, two Democrats on the council who voted against the bill were replaced by Democrats who voted yes on Monday. Equality North Carolina, an advocacy group, had helped support pro-LGBT candidates. Its unclear how soon the the state could attempt to override Charlottes law. The General Assembly, which is currently out of session, could hold an extra session or take up the issue when they reconvene in spring. Moore appeared unlikely to pursue immediate action, as the governor suggested. A spokesperson for his office told BuzzFeed News the speaker would prefer a bill during the legislative session that convenes April 25, rather than immediately summoning lawmakers to the capitol. One state lawmaker, Rep. Dan Bishop, also sent city officials a letter this month claiming the city lacked legal authority to pass a nondiscrimination ordinance because the state never delegated that power to municipalities.

aS"The court process is slow, biology is fast. View this image  Isabelle with her mum Naomi. Sean Davey for BuzzFeed Isabelle is transgender, and describes herself as cursed with some physical characteristics that mean her body doesnt match her identity as a girl. Her childhood has not been an easy journey. I have tried to hurt myself, and questioned whether I want to be here in my darkest times, she said. Once she is old enough, Isabelle wants to take cross-sex hormones, also known as stage two treatment, which will allow her to go through puberty and develop as a girl. But her life is laced with fear and worry, as she knows in order to access this treatment, she has to go to court and get approval. I dont just want to access stage two treatment, she said. I need to. View this image  Sean Davey for BuzzFeed Its the first time these children, their families, and medical experts have come together in a concerted lobbying effort to remove the role played by the Family Court when it comes to accessing stage two treatment. Australia is the only country in the world where transgender children must get court approval to start hormone treatment. This delay places enormous stress on transgender children, who face alarmingly high rates of self-harm and suicide if they cannot access treatment. At the event run by the Parliamentary Friends of LGBTI Australians, 15-year-old Georgie Stone said having to go to court made her feel lost and hopeless. I had to go to court to be who I already am, she said. Only I have the right to determine what goes into my body. However, caught in a lengthy court process, Georgie had to wait and she became increasingly anxious and withdrawn as she worried about her voice breaking. View this image  Georgie Stone embraces her twin brother Harry with mum Rebekah Robertson after addressing the forum. Sean Davey for BuzzFeed As parents, we walk ahead of our child like a landmine detector, clearing the path before them. Robertson described the pressure on young transgender people and their families as enormous and relentless. To add court to this is unnecessary and cruel. The first is puberty blockers, a reversible treatment started at the onset of puberty that effectively suspends the childs body in time, preventing them from developing secondary sex characteristics such as a broken voice or breasts. In 2013, Georgie and her family won an appeal that sealed the right for transgender children to access stage one treatment without having to go to court. However, the court ruled that for stage two treatment taking cross-sex hormones that will develop their body into the gender they identify as people aged under 18 still needed court approval. This court process can cost between $10,000 and $30,000 and take 8-12 months to reach an outcome. Judges rely entirely on the medical testimony from doctors, and no child has ever been denied treatment. View this image  Sean Davey for BuzzFeed Dr Michelle Telfer, a pediatrician at the Gender Service at the Royal Childrens Hospital in Melbourne, said that of transgender kids who cannot access treatment, 50% self-harm and 30% attempt suicide. She said access to medical treatment significantly alleviates the anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts transgender children feel over developing a body that isnt right for them. Fiona Kelly, an associate professor at LaTrobe University who has done extensive research into the issue, described the court process as a very harmful, lengthy and expensive rubber stamp. Telfer, Kelly and the transgender children visited MPs and senators personally on Monday, as well as speaking to a group at the parliamentary friends event. Rices fellow co-chairs of the Parliamentary Friends of LGBTI Australians, Liberal MP Warren Entsch and Labor MP Graham Perrett, are strong advocates of the change. Weve heard the attorney general George Brandiss office is very engaged with the issue, she said. Its not vastly complicated legislation, and with cross party support, we should be able to get it through the parliament.

aS"After starring in A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddys Revenge, Mark Patton left Hollywood behind. More than 30 years later, the film has become a homoerotic cult classic and its leading man is coming to terms with what he calls the ultimate betrayal. I need you, Jesse, Freddy Krueger growls. Weve got special work to do here, you and me, he says, tenderly flicking the hair out of the teenage boys eyes. Youve got the body. Ive got the brain. A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddys Revenge was a far cry from the original. Released in 1985, just one year after the first film, the movie replaced final girl Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) with a male lead Jesse Walsh, played by Mark Patton. Robert Englunds Freddy Krueger was largely the same, but the dynamic between predator and prey had shifted. Freddy and Jesse were intimate they seemed to share a secret and the subtext of that relationship gave Freddys Revenge a homoerotic undercurrent that eventually made it a cult classic. View this image  Mark Patton Courtesy End Times Production That first encounter between Jesse and Freddy is loaded with sexual tension and according to Patton, what ended up onscreen is actually a toned-down version of what the scene almost was. [Robert] asked if he could put the blade inside my mouth, Patton recalled to BuzzFeed News from a quiet Mexican restaurant near the highway in San Diego. It was his makeup artist, Danny Marc, who took it upon himself to help the young actor protect his image. Danny grabbed me and he said, Absolutely not. Dont do it. Dont do it. And so, I turned to Robert and said, I really dont feel comfortable with that, and he goes, OK. So he just did around the lips instead of going in and out. If it would have gone in and out, it would have been really not a good thing. However much Englund held back, the damage was done: That scene helps establish the indelible impression of Freddys Revenge as the gayest slasher film ever made. And it only continued from there. Jesses struggle over his sexual identity is directly aligned with Freddys attempt to take over his body. (Hes inside me and he wants to take me again! Jesse cries.) Jesse flees from a makeout session with his heterosexual romantic partner Lisa (Kim Myers) and ends up in the bedroom of his hunky friend Grady (Robert Rusler) directly on top of him. Something is trying to get inside my body, Jesse laments. To which Grady replies, And you want to sleep with me? And the death scene for Coach Schneider (Marshall Bell) whom Jesse runs into at a leather bar in the middle of the night has the sadistic gym teacher strung up naked in the showers, his bare ass whipped by a towel with a mind of its own before hes slashed to death by Krueger. Although the film was a relative financial success and propelled the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise along, it was derided by critics and genre fans. Screenwriter David Chaskin spent years refusing to acknowledge any intentional subtext in his script a position he has since reversed and director Jack Sholder claimed not to have noticed the movies gayness during filming. Watching Freddys Revenge now, its hard to comprehend that there was ever a debate over the films subtext, which becomes just plain text in the more blatantly homoerotic scenes. I love when [Chaskin] uses the word subtext, Patton noted. Did you actually go to a freshman English course in high school? This is not subtext. View this image  New Line Cinema With the screenwriter and director unwilling to shoulder any of the responsibility, fans began to fixate on Pattons performance as Jesse, who is more traditionally feminine than the standard slasher film bro. His sexual ambiguity made him the perfect choice for Jesse, but it gave the homophobic detractors of Freddys Revenge something to latch on to. And even though Patton has embraced his scream queen status he had just come from signing autographs and panel appearances at San Diego Comic-Con this July afternoon he remains driven by a need to set the record straight about the film that has haunted him for the past 30 years. For Patton, whose only major film role before he played Jesse was as a gay teenager later revealed to be a trans woman (played by Karen Black) in Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean, the persistent criticism of Freddys Revenge was its own kind of nightmare: His sexual identity was excoriated for ruining the film and with it, his career. As the actor tells it, he became pigeonholed as gay long before being an out leading man was a possibility. At the same time, even as the AIDS crisis decimated the gay community, Patton was forced to stay in the closet, restricted by a business he eventually chose to leave behind. With the destigmatization of queer representation over the last 30 years, perception of Freddys Revenge has shifted: The heavily coded queerness that was once a mark against it has become a charmingly dated relic of another time, and a selling point for cult connoisseurs. So, too, has Pattons relationship with the film and its fanbase changed. But as he struggles to move forward, he is left trying to balance his appreciation of the films belated fandom with the pain he still feels over what he considers a three-decades-old betrayal. A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 performed well at the box office, earning a domestic gross of nearly $30 million (about $68 million, adjusted for inflation). Initial reviews, though largely negative, did not point out the films homoerotic slant, although Variety called Pattons Jesse strange enough to constitute an outsider presence, a descriptor that certainly signifies queerness. There is some debate over where the first direct mention of the films gay subtext appeared. Patton and Sholder cite the Village Voice, while Chaskin believes it was actually the gay publication The Advocate. The article in question called Freddys Revenge, by Sholders recollection, the gayest horror film ever made. Sholder remembers being amused by the piece, which was read to him by Sara Risher, then the head of production at New Line Cinema. For his part, Chaskin deliberately remained silent. View this image  New Line Cinema I feigned ignorance, he wrote in an email to BuzzFeed News. My movie was being outed and I didnt know how I felt about that. The truth of where the article was published is largely insignificant, but the confusion speaks to a recurring theme of discordance in the history of Freddys Revenge, with Patton on one side, and Sholder and Chaskin on the other. While theres no doubting the oppressive homophobia of 1980s Hollywood, the specific circumstances surrounding the film are often a matter of he said, he said. There is, for example, the question of whether there was concerted effort by the studio to keep anyone else from commenting on the queer subtext after the articles release. Chaskin said he didnt know, though he did note that he was questioned by a couple of [New Line] execs who were genuinely quite surprised by the review and palpably worried about how it might affect box office. By contrast, Patton insists that Chaskin, instead of merely staying quiet, repeatedly placed the blame for the queer interpretation of the film on Pattons too gay performance, rather than on the script. In his email, Chaskin maintained that although he is sympathetic to Pattons perception, its simply not the way he remembers things. I dont recall any interview where I would have used the words too gay but if I implied something like that and/or said anything to cause Mark grief, I certainly apologize, he wrote. It was not my intention. Amid the back-and-forth, one thing is clear: The queer subtext of Freddys Revenge became the movies most notable characteristic. Deliberately or otherwise, Pattons association with what came to be known as the gayest horror film ever made while he was being told to keep his sexuality a secret left lasting scars. His experience with A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 indelibly tainted his perception of Hollywood. Ultimately, it made it that much easier to leave the business behind. I dont ever want to be unkind to anybody, but the truth of the matter is, [Chaskin] really did systematically fag-bash me for 30 years, and it hurt. He sabotaged me. And thats why I quit, Patton said. Nobody ever affected my confidence the boys that threw rocks at me, nobody but this man did. Patton was tormented by his classmates from a young age. Growing up in Kansas City in the 1960s, he stood out and soon realized he was gay. The way he remembers it, he never really had to come out, because he never stood a chance of staying in. Everyone noted his difference, though it wasnt something he spoke about openly. Patton was picked on mercilessly his classmates threw around fag with regularity. I figured, if they could see that about me, then all the other things they said about me must have been true also, he said. Patton found respite in his high schools theater department, under the guidance of drama teacher Mildred Fulton, whom he calls the person who changed my life. Fulton recognized Pattons unique talent and his inability to fit in with his small-town surroundings so she took a special interest in Patton. His senior year, while Patton was looking at colleges, Fulton pulled him aside and gave him a radical suggestion, a move he believes could have gotten her fired. She gave me two copies of After Dark, which was a gay theater magazine from New York, he recalled. She said, I think you should get on a plane and go to New York and be an actor, because you have everything you need to do it right now. Patton also found unlikely support from another source: his father. A truck driver and master sergeant in the Marine Corps, Pattons father was, as he recalled, a tough man. But while their relationship was not perfect, he was fiercely protective of his son. He also supported Pattons interests, letting him pick out his own Christmas presents after he was disappointed by Army clothes and footballs one year. [My father] told me to befriend myself, Patton said. He turned me to a mirror and he said, Always be on his side. If you have to be on somebodys side, be on his side. That advice, coupled by Fultons recommendation, directly inspired Patton to leave his hometown behind and pursue acting in the big city as soon as he graduated high school at 18. I did learn to take my own side, Patton said. Thats what I decided in Kansas City. I thought, Theres something wrong with them, theres nothing wrong with me. When I get out of here, Im gonna be fine. New York was a major adjustment from Kansas City and the life Patton was used to. When he arrived, he had nowhere to go, so he followed a flight attendant to Grand Central Station. Despite the overwhelming nature of Manhattan and the fact that he was directionless, with only $137 to his name Patton instantly fell in love. I was ignorant, and I think my ignorance actually served me very well, he said. I really wasnt smart enough to be afraid. Patton quickly found work in New York for two reasons: One, he had an advantage when it came to commercials, because he could convincingly play younger but didnt need a tutor on set; and two, he took any job he could get, whether or not it was glamorous or even onscreen. If it was carrying a cable, I would carry that cable because I knew it would help me in the end, he said. Work aside, living in the big city was transformative for Patton on a personal level. The parts of himself hed been urged to repress in Kansas City his intrinsic queerness were suddenly being embraced. I had this experience of breathing the first relaxed breath that Id ever had when I got to New York, he reflected. Everything that was a negative where I came from suddenly became a positive: the way I talked, the way my ass looked, the way I walked. [I realized] there are people who appreciate people like me. I felt safe, like nobody was going to beat me up. That sense of security was regrettably short-lived. The more successful Patton got, the more he learned that his sexual identity was still perceived as a hindrance. It had always been a fine line to walk: While going to gay bars wasnt something you had to hide in 1970s New York, you didnt go into an audition and talk to the casting director about being gay, he said. When Patton made his 1982 Broadway debut in Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean playing the same queer character he would play in the film adaptation later that year The Advocate requested an interview with him. Patton was told by his manager to turn it down. I got the lecture from my manager on the type of clothes that I should wear and that I needed to take a girl to the opening night, he said. Then I learned how the game begins. Things only got worse in the 80s when Patton started traveling to California to embark on a film and television career. He wanted to become a movie star, so Los Angeles was the place to be. But the reality of the closet there made it 90 shades of horrifying, he said. Its a vicious, cutthroat game, Patton said. At the time, being gay was a definite negative, and it was a definite deal breaker. It was a card that people could play on you, and they would play it. It was in that environment of debilitating repression that Patton won the part of Jesse in A Nightmare on Elm Street 2. While he recognized that, on the page, the character read as queer, he also knew this was the sequel to a hit horror film. Jesse was the starring role in a mainstream movie, a gig that Patton realized could be a major moment in his career. It was the kind of movie that could turn you into Johnny Depp, Patton said of the actor who made his film debut as Nancys boyfriend Glen in A Nightmare on Elm Street. I was living in Los Angeles, and I was living that dream. I was on that track. I could see it happening for me. Whatever thematic resonance Patton picked up on when he first read the script, nothing could prepare him for what Freddys Revenge became. He said that while working on the film, he observed changes that were being made to the script and the movies overall direction changes that he believed were underlining the films queerness. It just became undeniable, Patton said. I mean, when youre looking at dailies and Im lying in bed and Im a piet and the candles are dripping and theyre bending like phalluses and white wax is dripping all over Its like Im the center of a what do they call it? a bukkake. Like Im a bukkake video. This wasnt just unsubtle; it was completely in-your-face. It was camp. And given what Patton sees as intentionality on behalf of the filmmakers, he perceived the bait and switch to be a stab in the back. That was the ultimate betrayal, Patton said. The pit just kept getting deeper and deeper. And more and more gay. Although Patton had aspirations of being an out working actor, he knew the reality of Hollywood in 1985 was more complicated than that. The gayer Freddys Revenge got, the more anxiety he felt. I was concerned about my career being destroyed, he said. Chaskin denied that any of the changes made during production had anything to do with its gay content. I was working at New Line throughout the production and was, therefore, on call for any rewrites and revisions, the screenwriter explained in his email. I knew about every page change and never heard about any suggestions of that kind. View this image  New Line Cinema But Chaskin went on to note that in terms of the gay themes, very few people on the production got it. Its possible that some of the additions to the film that Patton interpreted as homoerotic and that the movies large queer fanbase has come to accept as such were not directly intended to be. Patton concedes that most of the people involved with the film were truly unaware of what was going on. (They were just dumb straight guys who didnt have a clue, he said.) For his part, Sholder now acknowledges the subtext, though he said he was, like the rest of the creative team, ignorant to it at the time. In a phone interview with BuzzFeed News, he credited his inability to pick up on those themes to the tight production schedule and the fact that his attention was on the five single pages of special effects, out of which I knew how to do about three. I mean, clearly [theres] the gay S&M bar, and the ass-whipping and all of the other stuff, and some of the lines that people have picked up on, like, Hes inside me, Sholder said. I honestly never got to that level of subtext with it. Producer and New Line Cinema founder Robert Shaye, who has a cameo in the film as the leather-clad bartender at the aforementioned S&M bar, still doesnt see the subtext. No, I dont, and I dont look at it very often in retrospect, he told BuzzFeed News over the phone. This is all kind of hindsight, but it may be that the fact Mark was a closeted gay at that point, or at least as far as the film business went, that that was part of what was coming through there, Sholder suggested of why Freddys Revenge read as queer. It never even occurred to me that he was gay although he wasnt too great in the makeout scenes, so I should have picked up on it. Sholder said he was drawn to and zoned in on Pattons vulnerability, but that he didnt know anything about Pattons sexuality until shortly before production wrapped on Freddys Revenge. When asked directly if he believes casting Patton contributed to the gay subtext of the movie, Chaskin wrote, Of course. But not because hes gay! Mark is a talented actor who seems to know his craft. His interpretations of Jesse were choices that he made (I assume, in consultation with Jack; I wasnt there for rehearsals), he elaborated. I have to believe that he got it and that was how he decided to play it. Now that the tide has turned toward widespread acceptance of gay representation, Chaskin is upfront about the queer undertones he deliberately wrote into his script. As far as his motivation for queering A Nightmare on Elm Street, he said he was responding to the social and political climate for gay people in the 1980s. Without directly bringing up the issues of homophobia and the AIDS epidemic, he wanted to explore and respond to the gay panic that was gripping the nation. Homophobia was skyrocketing and I began to think about our core audience adolescent boys and how all of this stuff might be trickling down into their psyches at an age when raging hormones often produce dreams and urges that make them (if only unconsciously) begin to question their own sexuality, Chaskin wrote. My thought was that tapping into that angst would give an extra edge to the horror. Only Chaskin can know what was going through his head when he wrote Freddys Revenge, but Patton does not buy the screenwriters version of events. After being confronted with Pattons claims, Chaskin also reached out to Patton directly to make amends for these perceived slights. In a follow-up email to BuzzFeed News, Patton said, David apologized to me in the most general way about offending me in the press and on film, but cannot recall ever having said I was too gay. I am pointing out to him that he lied about the film for 30 years, Patton continued in his email, and each time, when asked for a comment about negativity, mentioned my sexuality in some way. View this image  Courtesy End Times Production Unfortunately, many of these articles seem to have been lost to time, and Patton is keeping the materials he does have close to the chest for use in the documentary hes producing about his experiences, Scream, Queen: My Nightmare on Elm Street, which is due out later this year. Perhaps because hes dealt with conflicting accounts of his history as he remembers it, Patton is more determined than ever to tell his story on own terms. Based on his documentary research, which he declined to share, Patton believes that Chaskin has repeatedly contradicted himself in interviews at the time of the release of Freddys Revenge. When he was backed into a corner about it being a gay movie, he [claimed he] wanted to liberate his gay friends, Patton said. He made himself into the hero, which is what he has done all along. Sholder, who has by now heard both sides many times, maintains that while hes compassionate toward Pattons point of view, he believes its time to move on. Mark has this whole sort of conspiracy theory about David and that he said one thing and then he changed his mind, Sholder said. It doesnt mean very much to me except insofar as I like Mark and I sympathize with what hes been through and what hes done with his life, and so I kind of understand where its all coming from. But I was hoping he could finally let it go. Right after the film came out, of course, the wound was still fresh, and after making a couple of television appearances in 1986, Patton then went off the radar for nearly 25 years. It wasnt that he wasnt being offered parts, he said, but that he was emotionally drained by what happened with A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 and fed up with the homophobic culture of 1980s Hollywood. It was a definite choice that I made to stop acting, Patton said. It wasnt by attrition. It was just I needed to stop. The real turning point came in 1987 when he was offered the role of a gay character on a TV pilot. It would have been a significant step forward for Patton, not to mention for LGBT representation. At the time, queer characters were primarily limited to Very Special Episodes and even then, their presence was a rarity. Meanwhile, Patton himself was still being instructed to stay in the closet. I was sitting at a table with 14 gay men who were telling me things like, Will your girlfriend feel OK about this? When people ask you, Are you gay? will you feel comfortable saying that youre not? he recalled. This wasnt the first time, of course, that Patton had been pressured against coming out. But the timing of the conversation at the height of the AIDS epidemic was what pushed him to his breaking point. Hollywood looked like a ghost town. Youd see people and three months later theyd be dead, Patton said. I thought, My god, half the world is fucking dying and these people are sitting here having this conversation. I didnt get into [acting] for this. Show business had once been Pattons refuge, and his early experiences as an actor in New York marked the first time he really felt comfortable with himself. It wasnt just Freddys Revenge that cast a shadow on show business: Patton finally saw on a larger scale that, for the time being, the entertainment industry and the closet were inextricably linked. I found safety in the theater, and I came out in the theater, he said. This is a place I came to feel safe. I didnt come here to build a prison to live in. And that in my mind, thats when the key locked and thats when I ended. In some ways, Patton has moved on with his life. After leaving Hollywood, he moved back to New York, where he embarked on a career as an interior decorator. That eventually took him to Palm Beach, Florida. He branched out into architecture and, nine years ago, moved to Puerto Vallarta with Hector Morales Mondragon, now his husband. The two own a successful gallery and store. When we moved to Mexico and Im living on a dirt road, I thought, Well, theres the period on that, he said of his acting career. But it wasnt long after his relocation that the producers of the 2010 documentary Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy found Patton with assistance from a private investigator and gave him a call. Although he was reluctant to step back in front of a camera, particularly to discuss A Nightmare on Elm Street 2, Patton was swayed by the effort taken to locate him. Although he has some regrets I had no idea I was fat until I saw the thing, he said the documentary gave him a public profile for the first time in decades. View this image  Patton onstage during a Nightmare on Elm Street 2 Q&A panel on Sept. 7, 2013, in Indianapolis. Joey Foley / Getty Images Since then, Patton has reconsidered his decision to give up acting. He is slowly easing back into the entertainment industry, a different environment now than it was when he turned his back on it in the late 80s. And hes finding a balance between the life hes made for himself and his first passion. Hes already filmed one movie in Berlin and appeared in three others last year. Im a real believer in, if it comes your way and its really cool, just say yes, because the opportunities that Ive been afforded in life are opportunities that a lot of people work for forever, he said. And if you dont like it, you can stop. Ill go back and sell my purses in Mexico and Ill be fine. Aside from acting, Patton has made numerous appearances at horror conventions, something he never would have considered prior to Never Sleep Again. It was through conventions and the horror community at large that Patton realized the positive effect Freddys Revenge had on so many fans, particularly queer people who so rarely see themselves represented in horror. But since Patton had purposely extricated himself from Hollywood and distanced himself from any discussion of Freddys Revenge he was surprised to learn that the movie had transitioned from disappointing failure in the eyes of Nightmare fans to a cult gay classic. And he was even more surprised to find out that hed become an under-the-radar gay icon after all, his other major role was as a queer teenager in a movie co-starring Cher. Patton described fan interactions with gay men who tell him, You were the first person I ever saw onscreen that I felt would love me back. And his seeming disappearance only added to the intrigue. I didnt think I was famous. I just thought I was a has-been and a failure, Patton said. I didnt realize I was considered iconic. It has been a complicated journey toward accepting his celebrity, particularly as its linked to a painful past experience. But as Patton has embraced his fandom, hes found comfort in the role of advocate. Between Freddys Revenge and his re-emergence in Never Sleep Again, Patton was diagnosed with AIDS, which he calls a life-changing experience. And its one he almost didnt recover from: At the time of his diagnosis, Patton had pneumocystic pneumonia and cancer and tuberculosis, weighed 130 pounds, and [had] no T cells and a viral load of 4 million. I was dead, he said. Pattons ex-boyfriend had died from AIDS-related complications in the 80s, and Patton had gotten tested repeatedly at that time. His results were always negative, so he stopped thinking about it. I just thought, Im one of those people, he said. All those boys think theyre one of those people and theyre generally not. Patton has seen a general cultural ignorance toward the reality of HIV, which is part of why he has chosen to speak about his status, especially at horror conventions where such things are rarely discussed. I always start my pitch with, Im gonna talk about Freddy Krueger for 57 minutes, and then you have to give me three minutes about AIDS, he said of his convention speeches. It behooves the older generation who knows these things to tell them to younger people and say, as recently as 1985, as recently as 1990, it wasnt like this, and you need to know that, Patton said. I feel thats a part of my job. Im a witness of something. I witnessed AIDS. I witnessed the devastation of that. I witnessed real homophobia. And Im just telling my story. Since resurfacing, Patton has received offers from publishers and producers who are interested in having him tell his story. While exploring the idea of writing a book about his experiences, he discovered how deeply Freddys Revenge still affected him. I thought I had put it to rest, he said. When I began to really research, I tapped into a wall of rage that was so huge that I didnt know was there. I had many dark nights of the soul, pacing my bedroom going, Why in the fuck am I doing this? Patton ultimately landed on the Scream, Queen documentary, with the assistance of executive producer Roman Chimienti, a diehard fan of A Nightmare on Elm Street 2. As Patton put it, the documentary is his catharsis. Its not as straightforward as hed hoped, perhaps. After giving an on-camera interview for Scream, Queen, Sholder took Patton aside and suggested it might be time for him to get over this. I felt that he had a lot of anger, and it seemed like he directed a lot of it at the writer, Sholder said. I thought that Mark had maybe blown this thing a little out of proportion. The experience obviously had way more personal meaning for him than it had for me. View this image  Courtesy End Times Productions And Chaskin, though also sympathetic to Patton, maintains that he never intended any harm in his script, or in comments he made about Freddys Revenge in subsequent years. When asked specifically, per Pattons claim, that he had exploited the homophobic atmosphere at the time for the film, Chaskin wrote, When you put it that way, it sounds almost diabolical. Once the documentary is released, perhaps Patton truly will be able to put Freddys Revenge behind him for good. As it stands, he continues to waver, presenting the portrait of someone who has seen it all and lived to tell about it, but also someone who continues to wrestle with the wrongs done to him and the men who say those wrongs may have never taken place. Theres a real power in not giving a fuck, Patton said, with something resembling a shrug. I dont care what anybody thinks of me anymore.  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"A robocall going out to voters the night before the South Carolina primary casts Trump as pro-LGBT. Its about transgender bathrooms in your childs school. Its about tearing down our Judeo-Christian values, the narrator warns. View this image  Jim Watson / AFP / Getty Images CLEMSON, S.C. A new robocall going out to South Carolina voters on the eve of the states Republican primary blasts Donald Trump as a culture war appeaser in the battle between gay rights and religious freedom and urges listeners to support Ted Cruz before its too late. The recorded message which was obtained by BuzzFeed News after an earlier report cited a source in Columbia, S.C. who heard it Friday night begins with a narrator saying, Check out how Trump answers this. The message then cuts to a recording of an interview with NECN reporter Sue OConnell, who asks Trump if he would, as president, advocate for the expansion of gay and lesbian rights. Im a lesbian, OConnell tells Trump. Weve had some great progress for the gay and lesbian community through politics, through all sorts of judicial actions and elected actions over the past 20 years. When President Trump is in office, can we look for more forward motion for equality for gays and lesbians? Trump responds, Well, you can. And look, thats your thing, and other people have their thing. We have to bring all people together. At this point, the narrators voice, now taking on an incredulous tone, interjects: Stop. What does she mean by forward motion? Whats he agreeing to? Its not about tolerance anymore, the narrator continues. Its about mandatory celebration. Its about forcing people to bake cakes and photograph gay weddings. Forcing clergy to officiate. Its about transgender bathrooms in your childs school. Its about tearing down our Judeo-Christian values. Its about tearing down our America. The recording ends with an ominous sign-off from the narrator: Ted Cruz for president now, before its too late. The recording was paid for by the Courageous Conservative Political Action Committee, the same pro-Cruz group that launched another eleventh-hour robocall this week attacking Trump for praising the removal of the Confederate Flag from the South Carolina statehouse. The Palmetto States political scene has a sordid history of last-minute mudslinging and whisper campaign and election-eve robocalls are frequently part of that tradition. A spokeswoman for Cruz told the Post and Courier newspaper Friday that the campaign did not condone the Confederate flag call. But she did not respond to requests for comment from BuzzFeed News Friday night about the new robocall, except to say that the campaign wasnt associated with it. w.soundcloud.com  This story has been updated to include more detail about the robocall as well as the full audio.

View this image  Just as people have allergies or sensitivities to ingredients in skincare products, the same goes for lube and your genitals, says Berman. Generally, more ingredients will mean more irritation to someone with sensitivities or allergies, says Berman. So if you know youre prone to infections or rashes, stick with the simple stuff and test a tiny amount on your arm or stomach before using it on your genitals just in case. If you develop any itching, burning, pain, or other irregular symptoms, stop using it immediately and seek medical care if the reaction gets worse.

Silicone-based: Silicone lubes have a unique silky feel and theyre usually hypoallergenic. Since the silicone molecules are too large to absorb into skin, the lube is super slippery and lasts much longer so you dont need to re-apply as often and it works for water play. But silicone lube will actually ruin silicone sex toys, because it breaks down the surface and makes the toys gummy and gross. Oil-based: Oil-based lubes feel great and you can find them in your kitchen (coconut and olive oil work great). However, theyre not safe to use with condoms because they make the latex porous so its prone to ripping, which increases the risk of pregnancy or STIs. While its good for masturbation and massage, its also oil, so itll be hard to clean and it can stain sheets or clothing. FYI: We talked to Dr. Jennifer Berman, urologist and female sexual health expert; Claire Cavanah, co-founder of woman-friendly sex shop chain Babeland; and Dr. Mary-Jane Minkin, clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Yale School of Medicine. View this image  The experts say that simple water- and silicone-based lubes are best. Vaginal tissue is extremely sensitive, so anything hypoallergenic is great, especially if youre prone to irritation or UTIs, says Minkin. So stay away from scents, flavors, or hot/cold sensations lubes with menthol or cinnamon unless you know it doesnt bother you. Definitely avoid synthetic oil or petroleum-based products like Vaseline, says Berman. They dont really work and they get super sticky because petroleum isnt water-soluble. Its like a petri dish for bacteria and microbes to grow and cause infection, says Berman. Natural oil (coconut, olive, jojoba) isnt a bad option, but it can be hard to clean off, and you cant use it with condoms. Babeland / Via babeland.com Babeland / Via babeland.com Its great for vaginal sex because its non-irritating and doesnt get sticky which also makes clean up a breeze.We love it because it works on all toys, and its free of glycerin, a sugar compound, Cavanah says. But since its water-soluble, you probably dont want to use it in the bath or shower because itll dissolve quickly. Buy it here in a variety of sizes from $.50 to $15.

Its safe on all sex toys and it has a touch of organic lemon and vanilla so it smells great too without the harsh chemical additives. But since its water-based, this will dry out faster so it isnt great for marathon sex or water-play. Buy it here for $14.99 or purchase at Target, Wal-Mart, or CVS. View this image  This is a water-based formula thats also pH-balanced. The vagina is an acidic place, so its good to use a lube that helps maintain that pH and prevent it from getting too alkaline, which can lead to vaginitis or yeast and urinary tract infections, Berman says.

Pre-seed is the only lubricant proven in clinical trials to not inhibit sperm motility so its great if youre trying to conceive, says Minkin. (It doesnt enhance sperm motility, it just doesnt mess with it.) It also has plant-based antioxidants and its a good moisturizing option if youre dry.

Each 10 ml bottle has 150 mg THC (~15 servings) but it doesnt actually get you high or have any psycho-active effects on the brain. Once absorbed, the THC helps to relax the vaginas smooth muscle and relieve pain, says Berman. The cannabis and coconut oil base makes it great for massages and foreplay as well, but that also means Foria isnt safe to use with latex condoms. Buy it here for $38. Note: Foria is currently only available for purchase by California residents with a valid medical marijuana card. View this image  Even though the experts agree that everyone should embrace their natural smell and taste, flavored lubes can be a fun and delicious addition, too. Most flavored options are water-based since its safer to swallow, says Cavanah. Whereas silicone can leave your mouth all slippery and oil can leave a gross sticky residue. Since you may be ingesting a little of the lube when you use it, there are even vegan and kosher options to compliment everyones dietary restrictions. However, any flavored lubes with actual sugar or sugar compounds can alter the vaginas pH and potentially lead to infections, so you probably want to skip those for cunnilingus. View this image  Sliquid is 100% vegan and pH balanced, so its typically safe for all. That said, it does contain an artificial sweetener, so maybe steer clear if youre very sensitive to irritation. Buy it here for $12 in a variety of flavors.

Both water- and silicone-based lubes are great, but Cavanah says silicone is a better option since its super slippery and comfortable, plus you dont need to reapply it all the time.

aS"While working to finish her undergraduate degree at the University of Pennsylvania, 23-year-old Jara Krys is working toward some ambitious goals. By diversifying her clients, increasing her rates, and investing heavily in her personal brand, Krys aims to become the worlds most elite transgender escort and a high-profile advocate for sex worker rights and trans equality. View this image  Jara Krys in Philadelphia on Jan. 7, 2016. Charles Mostoller for Buzzfeed News On an August afternoon in Philadelphia, 23-year-old Jara Krys is drinking iced tea in an upscale bottle shop, the kind of place where men in bespoke suits stop on the way home from corner-office jobs and linger in front of the beer case. Krys, whos taking time off from a bachelors degree in economics and international studies at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, might earn in three days what some of those men make in two weeks. Every so often, she glances around the room, as if shes expecting to see someone she knows. It wouldnt be a stretch for her to run into one of her clients in this neighborhood, a tony enclave of BMW-driving execs and their yoga-mat-toting wives, although she wont reveal any names. That kind of discretion is protocol in the upper echelons of finance occupied by her Wharton peers, but in Kryss line of work, the stakes are different: Shes a high-end transgender escort who charges a base rate of $500 an hour and plans to double that amount later this year. Shes also in the process of revamping her brand, which she describes with the calculated fervor of a tech CEO. Krys talks with her hands, throwing disco-ball spots of sunlight with her long, varnished fingernails. In spite of the 90-degree heat, shes dressed in all black: a black crop top, black jeans, and black Michael Kors wedge sneakers. Her hair is shoulder-length and shaved on one side. With her blue-green contacts and pale skin, she looks vaguely like a punk Disney princess. Her attention is birdlike, lighting on one thing after another. At one point, she reaches into her purse and takes out a pressed powder compact. She checks her reflection, dabbing at a shiny spot on her nose. Im just a perfectionist, she sighs. Krys oozes ambition, and it doesnt seem to faze her that theres no blueprint for what shes setting out to do: Use her Penn education to advance her career as an escort and, once shes made a name for herself, become a powerful advocate for sex worker rights and trans equality. Krys first entered the sex trade as an orphaned 18-year-old in Las Vegas with few practical options for making ends meet. She was living on her own as a senior in high school, covering expenses that far exceeded what she would have been able to earn from any minimum-wage, part-time job. But for many trans people, even a minimum wage job can be out of reach. A 2013 study released by the Human Rights Campaign found that the unemployment rate for transgender people is twice as high as the rate for the general population, and theyre four times more likely to have a household income of less than $10,000 a year. Faced with this bleak economic situation, coupled with the high cost of transitioning, some transgender women turn to sex work. While there are no hard numbers on the trans female sex worker population in the U.S., The National Transgender Discrimination Survey, released last December, found that more than one in 10 of the 6,400 transgender adults polled had engaged in sex work. Black and black multi-racial respondents were the most likely to have been involved in the sex trade, followed by Hispanics and Latinos. As a group, transgender female sex workers are at high risk of contracting HIV, and theyre disproportionately affected by violence. But Krys, whos Latina herself, feels that theres a fundamental problem with the sex work narrative. Theres a huge stigma associated with being a sex worker, she says. It puts the blame on the women who become sex workers and not on the system that forced them into sex work, which makes it impossible to affect any real change. Krys believes that sex workers shouldnt be categorically pitied, nor should sex work be seen as a disgraceful way to earn a living. Her candor defies preconceptions about the underground nature of the sex industry. Shes talked about her work in several Philly news outlets and on social media, where she lists her profession as transgender model and entertainer. As the fight for trans equality has gained momentum, at least one prominent transgender person has spoken publicly about having been involved in sex work: writer and television host Janet Mock. I do not believe using your body often marginalized peoples only asset, especially in poor, low-income, communities of color to care after yourself is shameful, she wrote in a blog post in January 2014. And there are other former sex workers, like Melissa Gira Grant, who have brought their stories into the open to fight for destigmatization. Krys, for her part, aims to take that openness in a slightly different direction: She wants to achieve her business goals through escorting. Her plan, in pidgin Whartonese, is to leverage her diverse client portfolio to amass capital for future ventures, which might include a regular show on YouTube, a professionally designed website with an online store for trans-friendly sex toys, and, if all goes according to plan, a line of gender-non-conforming clothes and lingerie. She doesnt want to be a merely well-to-do escort and entrepreneur. She wants to be the most elite transgender escort in the world. Being able to talk openly about her trade is, in itself, a privilege, which Krys readily owns. Her hard-won financial stability shelters her from the violent reality faced by many transgender women, especially those involved in sex work, and its precisely that advantage that drives her to speak out. But her unique position isnt always easy to maintain. On one hand, she feels a kinship with the vast community of sex workers who so often are denied the right to advocate for themselves; on the other, shes determined to set herself apart from them, from everyone. View this image  Charles Mostoller for Buzzfeed News Krys grew up in Las Vegas, the unofficial capital of Nevadas $50-million-a year brothel industry, as the youngest of 13 children. She remembers her early years as a film dissolve of houses first, the roach-infested, three-bedroom place next to a hoarders compound, then the duplex in the slightly nicer neighborhood, and then her paternal grandmothers house in King City, California, where she lived for one year after her father, a fruit salesman, lost all his savings in an ill-fated cherry investment. Krys describes her family as traditionally Mexican, meaning they believedin theory, at leastin the machismo ideal: Men should be strong, women subservient to their men. There was no place in Kryss household for the feminine longings she had as someone who had been assigned male at birth her father and brothers made sure she understood that every time she tried on her sisters clothes or used their makeup. She says her sisters werent much kinder; they didnt hit her like the boys did, but they called her names and shut her out. As she entered adolescence, Krys presented as a feminine-looking gay boy, only daring to wear skirts and mascara on Halloween. Both her parents had died before her junior year of high school her mother from ovarian cancer when she was six, her father from a brain hemorrhage when she was 16, though chronic illness had rendered him unable to care for the family years before his death. At 15, Krys moved in with an older sister, Erendira Fuentes, who acted as her legal guardian. Krys hated being under her roof; Fuentes had children of her own, and with so many mouths to feed, Krys felt that she was viewed as a burden, a squatter who cared more about school than her own family. As soon as Krys turned 18, she moved into her own apartment, scraping by on food stamps and rental assistance. In spite of her home life, she excelled at school, holding down a near-perfect GPA. Kryss best friend, Troi Thomas, and one of Kryss high school teachers both remember her as an unstoppable force, a fiercely competitive kid who kept her classmates at arms length. She talked circles around her peers on the debate team. Thomas says that she could take any subject and, in less than two hours, come up with a winning set of arguments and rebuttals. The rest of the team would fall in step behind her. School was an escape for Krys, the one place where she felt in control. She didnt want anyone to know that she struggled with intense depression that, by age 16, shed already attempted suicide more than once. She desperately wanted to get out of Vegas, and the debate team was her one-way ticket. She would sooner go without meals than miss a tournament. When she picked up sex work to pay for trips with the team, she told no one not even Thomas. Jara and I sometimes talked about our sexual experiences, and I knew that shed been hooking up with some older men, says Thomas, now a senior at Towson University. But she never let on that they were paying her, and she certainly never let on that she was having a hard time living on her own and making ends meet. That was just Jara. She made damn sure no one knew anything was wrong. To Krys, becoming an escort didnt seem like such a radical detour Vegas, after all, is a city where sex work is an open secret. Soon after she turned 18, an older man she met on a gay dating site began paying her for sex. Krys says he was unattractive and socially awkward, but she never felt unsafe with him. Those older man-younger boy relationships happen a lot where people are disenfranchised as a community, she says. Older men creep on a lot of gay children who are looking for someone who will take care of them and treat them like their parents dont treat them. She learned a few things from that first client relationship several sex workers lived in his house, and Krys was a quick study but she stopped seeing him around the time she graduated from high school. View on Instagram Instagram: @jarakrys Krys was accepted on full financial aid to Penns prestigious Huntsman Program, a dual-degree track in economics and international studies through Wharton and the School of Arts and Sciences. When she arrived at Penn, she was still presenting as a gay boy. She felt disconnected from her body, but at least she was free from worrying about keeping a roof over her head and paying for meals. She moved into her dorm early for PennCAP, a program that helps low-income students transition to college. Through PennCAP, she made a few friends, and she was mostly happy. But once the Huntsman Program began, she started to feel like an outsider again. Huntsman has a reputation as an elite clique within an already elite institution. A student who was in the program with Krys says that there are definitely more people at the upper end of the socioeconomic spectrum in the average Huntsman class. The 50 or so freshmen in the program all lived on the same floor and hung out in a Huntsman-only lounge. They compared passports and planned trips to Paris for spring break. Krys hated the whole thing. She went to the mandatory events; otherwise, she hung out with her PennCAP friends and kept to herself. She still studied obsessively, pulling all-nighters before French exams. Her short-term memory was shot a common result of prolonged stress and trauma. Her discomfort with her body became totally unbearable. In the second half of her sophomore year at Penn, Krys began to publicly transition, but her depression deepened. I was going through a period where I looked ambiguous, she says. I hated it. I wasnt proud of being trans. The sight of her penis repulsed her, and she began to cut her genitals. She worked as much as she could to save up for hormones and surgeries, skipping classes to meet clients for $250 an hour. Her grades dropped from consistent As and A-s to B+s hardly a steep decline, but in the ultra-competitive Huntsman milieu, Krys felt like a failure. She never had money to go out. On campus, people called her a freak behind her back and openly sized up her crotch. They would refer to her using male pronouns, even after shed corrected them. She had traveled almost 2,500 miles to get away from her familys bigotry, and she felt more trapped and alone than ever. One night in February 2014, the winter of junior year, she hit rock bottom, and she knew immediately that she had to leave Penn. She wanted to focus on work to pay for her transition, and she decided she wouldnt go back to finish her degree until she felt ready. She withdrew from her classes. Then, with just $1,500 in her bank account, she went to New York Citythe first major investment in her career. She doesnt know where she would be today if that gamble hadnt paid off. It was beginners luck, she says. In this industry, when no one knows who you are, when no ones seen you anywhere, they all want you. But that first real foray into the world of full-time sex work was more than a lucky break. For Krys, it was the start of a vocation. View this image  Charles Mostoller for Buzzfeed News Kryss ongoing transition has had a significant impact on her earning potential. Throughout most of her time at Penn, she charged around $250 an hour. When she went to New York City, she upped her rate to $300 to cover the expenses associated with her nomadic lifestyle, plus the cost of reaching her target demographic: well-to-do, middle-aged, heterosexual men, many of whom are drawn to her Ivy-League credentials. Catering to their tastes isnt cheap. When Krys went to New York right after leaving Penn, with no home or safety net, she put every last cent in her bank account to work. She had to pay for hotels (which can cost anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 for a week-long trip), online advertising (up to $250, depending on how much she wants to promote herself), and food (whatevers left in her budget). When, in March 2015, she could finally begin to afford surgery, her marketability as an escort increased: The more feminine she appeared, the more she could charge. But Krys is wary of looking too much like an ordinary woman, which extends to her genitals. Penns student health insurance plan would have paid for gender confirmation surgery, which she has chosen not to undergo. Around the time she began her transition, she met someone who made her feel like she could enjoy sex without feeling ashamed of her body. Theres also a distinct economic advantage to not undergoing bottom surgery. Having a vagina would diminish her appeal as a rarity in a crowded market, and she wouldnt be able to charge as much. If you just want a cisgender woman, there are so many at the bar, Krys says. How are you going to find one at the bar thats trans? How are you going to find one at the bar thats trans and that youre attracted to? The men she sees all share a trans-girl fantasy, and Krys wants to fashion herself into their ultimate dream. Since last March, shes had rhinoplasty, breast augmentation, otoplasty (a procedure that pulled back her ears), a jawbone shave, a hairline adjustment, and two rounds of cheek augmentation. When she rolls out her brand new identity, shes going to change her fee scale. Rather than charging based on time, shell request $1,000 flat for an introduction, meaning very serious inquiries only. Shell stop advertising on Eros, her third-party site of choice, relying instead on word-of-mouth and her own redesigned website to attract new business. She talks about diversifying her portfolio in terms of her clients, parlaying their cash and social capital into a career in the fashion industry and then, eventually, into activism. Krys wants to cultivate long-term relationships with people who can help her make the right connections. In other words, shes not looking for clients; she wants investors. Krys herself is investing more than $5,000 into her brand, most of which will go toward hiring a photographer, makeup artist, and videographer to produce a series of promotional short movies for her new website, slated to launch later this year. In the not-too-distant future, she plans to move away from sex work altogether. Farther down the line, she wants to consult with other businesses to help them connect with a trans audience. No one has ever done anything like this before, Krys says. So I cant think five, ten years ahead. Im just focused on the next five, ten months. Shes already secured the legal rights to the name of her merchandise company. In the next few months, shell start developing a YouTube channel of makeup tutorials. And while her goals are still just goals, everything is possible for her. The only thing she knows for sure is that shes re-enrolling at Wharton next fall to finish her undergraduate degree. Much has already changed in Kryss life in a fairly short time. A year and a half ago, she was bouncing from hotel to hotel, breathing recycled air and obsessively monitoring her phone. Now, she rents an apartment in Philadelphia, where she can keep her belongings, where she can play Final Fantasy, her primary form of stress-relief and where, above all, she can be alone. View this image  Charles Mostoller for Buzzfeed News She was seeing 20 or so regulars in Philly at one point, but lately, shes scaled back to focus on her bigger plans, although shell see one or two of her most dedicated clients occasionally. Now, she works the most when shes not at home. At least two or three times a month, shell travel to meet people who contact her online. She always asks that they pay her trip expenses up front, plus a deposit, usually equal to an hour of her time. This past Thanksgiving, a man flew her out to his home in the rural Midwest (to protect her clients identity, she wont say where, exactly, but she did say that it was weird being in his house, surrounded by pictures of his family). Another two or three times a month, she travels on her own dime, setting herself up in a hotel and fielding online appointment requests. When shes in other cities, she might see anywhere from two to seven clients in a day. (Her all-time high: eight.) She always meets them in public, reading their body language and sizing up their intelligence not only because she can afford to be a bit of a snob at this point in her career, but because the smarter ones tend to appreciate her intellect and treat her accordingly. If they pass muster, shell see them. Some men just want a brief respite from their day-to-day lives, an hour of what Krys calls sex and therapy. Others are seeking long-term companionship without the quotidian disappointments of a real relationship. And a select few are looking for something deeper in certain cases, theyre struggling with their own sexual or gender identity, and they find solace with her. But Krys approaches every client relationship with the same level of intensity, even if she wont see that person again. She identifies as demisexual, which means that she doesnt feel physically attracted to strangers; for her, sexual fulfillment comes exclusively with emotional intimacy, and the intimacy shes paid to create in a vacuum is, for better or for worse, a facsimile of the kind that grows over time. I hate the idea of hooking up, she says. There always has to be some kind of connection, even if Im faking it. In some cases, there is a real connection: One particular client has become such a big part of her life that she brings him to her apartment, a privilege she extends to no one else. She refers to him as her husband, and hes offered to pay off her student loan debt. Its not a romantic thing, exactly, but it goes as deep as business can get before it becomes something else. For Krys, being able to count on someone like that is huge bigger, perhaps, than any promises of exclusivity. At this point, Krys doesnt see the value in pursuing a romantic relationship outside of work. Its not just that her standards are niche I want someone who wont be competitive with me, but someone whos really, really smart and ambitious, like a science nerd, and not super hot, just average-looking, she says its also a matter of economics. Spending time and money to find someone who isnt paying her doesnt make financial sense, especially when the vast majority of the men shes dated treated her, as she puts it, like shit. Krys has had three boyfriends since she started transitioning, all heterosexual men. Her relationships with them lasted about three months each. The first guy broke up with her because he couldnt accept the fact that she has sex with other people; she broke up with the last one because his idea of trans women extended only to porn. (The second relationship died of more or less natural causes: He wasnt over his ex.) Each step forward with someone new brings her that much closer to the conversation about what she does for a living, and that talk rarely goes well. Other men in the sex industry might be able to handle the demands of her work, but Krys doesnt want to date anyone with whom she might end up in competition not for clients, necessarily, but for prestige. Not coincidentally, Krys feels most respected in her work relationships, where she can set her price without compromise. My clients treat me like a princess, because theyre businessmen, and theyre paying for something, she says. But she hints at certain situations at the beginning of her career in which she mistook wesanll-choreographed intimacy for the real thing. Getting hurt like that, she says, is just another kind of collateral damage, a risk shes prepared to assume in the pursuit of her long-term goals. She has to fall back on ambition to keep herself sane, even when the cost of that ambition is her ability to lead a balanced life. Its exhausting, Krys admits. You cant make any plans, because you have to be ready 100 percent of the time, which means you cant have a social life. And when you spend so much time alone, especially when youre dealing with depression, you think too much. She stares off into space. You think about everything thats wrong. You think about things through a lens that no one else is looking through. View this image  Jara Krys has a drink at Starbucks in Philadelphia on Jan. 7, 2016. Charles Mostoller for Buzzfeed News Krys has few close friends, not only because her work often prevents her from making other plans, but because, in spite of her forthrightness, shes basically an introvert. Shes choosy about how she spends her time, and she finds that most people, including fellow escorts and others in the sex industry, arent usually worth hers. Of course, theyre the ones who would understand why she can never make plans in advance, who wouldnt take it personally when she has to cut out early to meet a client. But Krys says that hanging out with them can be toxic to her well-being, and she likes to keep her distance from anything that might hamper her ability to stay in control. She used to travel with another escort whom she considered a friend, but she doesnt hang out with her anymore. Krys makes it clear that in the world of sex work, the instinct for survival tends to trump compassion. Many of these girls have been treated badly, and they dont know anything else, she says. A lot of their behavior comes from internalized abuse. I understand why so many of them do drugs. She feels a strange combination of empathy for their situation and distaste for their actual company a dissonance that reminds her that, had things gone differently, she might not be where she is today. Escorts like Krys who can afford to choose their clients and keep a permanent place of their own are the exception rather than the rule. For many, street-based sex work far more dangerous is the only option. In October 2015, Kiesha Jenkins, a trans sex worker, was murdered in North Philadelphia in a botched robbery attempt; she was a target for robbery in the first place because she was known to be an escort, and therefore could have cash on her. Jenkins was one of more than 20 trans women murdered in 2015, most of whom were women of color. Krys says shes never feared for her life, and she knows that her privilege specifically, her Penn education, which gives her access to a certain clientele, and her surgery, which allows her to pass mostly unseen keeps her safe from many of the daily perils faced by her peers. But simply being trans sometimes puts her in harms way. When she was in Toronto on a work trip, not long after she left Penn, she was sexually assaulted by a man she met on Grindr who claimed to have dated several trans women. Ive spent so much time trying to forget it, she says. She never went to the police, because she was afraid of being found out as an escort. Krys believes that the decriminalization of sex work will make life less dangerous for all sex workers, especially those who are trans. Sex workers are often reluctant to report crimes for fear of being prosecuted themselves. For trans sex workers, that fear is compounded by the risk of being harassed, misgendered, and abused while dealing with public officials. Fifteen percent of trans people report having been sexually assaulted in police custody or jail, and as many as one in ten survivors of transphobic violence report being sexually assaulted by police officers. There are no reliable statistics on the incidence of police misconduct against trans sex workers, largely because those acts of violence often go unreported. Krys has once found herself in a position to report police misconduct: Last April, she was arrested by undercover Chicago police officers who tried to bust her for soliciting. While she was in custody, Krys says the officers refused to call her by female pronouns and told her she was lucky that they hadnt done worse than misgender her. With the help of a pro bono lawyer, she got the charges dropped and filed a complaint against the officers for transphobic behavior. (To make up for work opportunities she missed while dealing with the legal fallout, several clients advanced her a total of $6,000, which she used to pay for her breast augmentation.) Most assault victims dont hire legal representation, as Krys did after her Chicago incident. She doesnt take that luxury for granted, but neither will she shy away from using the means available to her to make her voice heard. If I want to create change, how am I supposed to do that being silent, without anyone paying attention to me? she says. I have to be the person saving my own life, and then saving my peers. But what Krys needs now in order to save herself money, surgery, a competitive edge are precisely the things that can sometimes alienate her from her peers. The only thing that makes me feel empowered and respected right now is achieving a cisnormative standard of beauty, she says. Society only values me if Im passable as a woman, which is no real value at all. But as long as Im trying to be part of society, I have to abide by the system. I have to achieve what I can in the system without regard to the system. Its an act, she says quietly. You do an act long enough, and you start to believe it. View this image  Charles Mostoller for Buzzfeed News Its a rainy day in mid-December, and Krys is lounging in her apartment, a newly renovated one-bedroom walk-up near Penns campus. The interior is spare and echoey, devoid of the usual flotsam of a twenty-somethings existence. The only furniture in the main living space a black leather sofa and armchair, a coffee table, a television hutch, and three kitchen counter stools all came with the lease. Everything is a shade of beige or gray or black, cast over with the purplish glow of the television screen, where an episode of The Fairly OddParents plays on mute. Even though shes lived here for almost five months, the place feels provisionally unpacked, arranged so that only the essential objects namely, her cosmetics are within reach. A shoebox filled with perfume sits on the windowsill behind the couch. Bins of makeup cover at least one third of the granite-topped breakfast bar. Im so happy with this place, she says, settling on the couch with catlike ease. As she talks about her home how the furniture was arranged when she first moved in, how shes since rearranged it, the high-test gaming laptop shes expecting in the mail she exudes a quiet pride in what she can call her own, in the world shes managed to create almost from scratch. What might come across as materialistic is, in fact, Kryss profound awareness of the real price of a comfortable life. She knows what it means to be hungry, to be uninsured and unable to pay for basic care. Shes gone from living on food stamps in Las Vegas to a pre-furnished, $1,250-a-month apartment no small feat for anyone, much less a transgender Latina woman. When she talks about where she likes to hang out in Philadelphia, the first place she names, without a hint of sarcasm, is her couch. Meaning alone, most of the time. But not always. A week or two ago, in a decorating frenzy, she invited a friend over to help her spray paint an artificial Christmas tree and turn it into an objet dart for year-round display in the two-by-two-foot space between the couch and the loveseat. But her friend was too slow with the aerosol can for Kryss taste, so he ended up watching as she shellacked the whole thing with black paint herself. Now, the tree is sitting in her bathtub, wrapped in a plastic bag. It needs a second coat, which shell get around to at some point. Theoretically, she could do it today, this minute. But shed rather go out and get ramen for lunch. Anyway, she says, a black Christmas tree can never be out of season. Itll give her something to do some night, when she has nowhere in particular to be. View this image  Charles Mostoller for Buzzfeed News Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Dominic Davies told BuzzFeed News the main reason he resigned was the organisations refusal to believe trans people have been subjected to conversion therapy. View this image  Dominic Davies Lois Froid Britains leading psychotherapist for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people has resigned from the UKs largest professional organisation for therapists, denouncing it for failing LGBT people, BuzzFeed News can reveal. In a withering attack, Dominic Davies, a fellow of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP), accused the body of hypocrisy, tokenism, arrogance, and inaction over a range issues affecting lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender patients. Davies, a government adviser and author of several books on LGBT therapy, said the BACP, which has more than 30,000 members, has shown a consistent failure to address the mental health needs of the queer community. And Davies who is the founder of Pink Therapy, the most prominent LGBT counselling clinic in Britain was particularly critical of his professional bodys apparent stance on conversion therapy, the attempt by some therapists to cure LGBT people. View this image  Pink Therapy Last year, the Department of Health invited Davies, along with other key figures from leading mental health organisations, to compile a Memorandum of Understanding on conversion therapy in a bid to stamp out the practice. It was signed by an array of mental health bodies, including the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the BACP, and the UK Council for Psychotherapy. But at the time, the statement did not mention conversion therapy used on trans people, despite the case of Leelah Alcorn, a trans teenager who killed herself following conversion therapy just weeks earlier. Her death led to President Barack Obama calling for a ban on conversion therapy. Throughout the discussion process, Davies said he lobbied for trans and asexual people to be included, but when they werent, he argued for the memorandum to be updated which is now due to take place next month. Earlier this week, however, Davies said he received a phone call from the BACP informing him its board of governors were unlikely to sign it. They say theres no evidence of trans people or asexuals receiving conversion therapy, he added. But theres plenty of evidence, both anecdotally but also research by the trans community. They [the BACP] might not be aware of the research but that doesnt mean it doesnt exist. View this image  Leelah Alcorn tumblr Davies said this call clinched his decision to go. He announced his resignation from the BACP in a blog post. I feel incredibly let down by my professional body. I am so frustrated by their constant inaction and lack of understanding of the issues that I am resigning. He then listed the reasons for his frustration, citing principally the BACPs response to his calls for it to sign the updated memorandum. He told BuzzFeed News that he sees a huge discrepancy at work: that the BACP insisted on evidence of transgender conversion therapy, but runs workshops on sex addiction, which is not a condition recognised by the American Psychiatric Association. Where is the evidence base there? he said. Its a hypocrisy. View this image  Jacky Chapman After more than 30 years specialising in LGBT therapy, and having been widely lauded for his work on the mental health of trans, non-binary, queer, and sexually variant people, Davies was in 2014 included in the Independent on Sundays list of Britains most influential LGBT people. But he feels his own professional organisation didnt draw on his expertise. The BACP appoint themselves as experts but Im a member of the World Professional Association of Transgender Health. I have a lot of experience of whats happening to trans people. It [the BACPs response to the memorandum] is outrageous. They think they know best when they dont. While Davies acknowledged that the BACP is aware of issues facing lesbian and gay people, he said it falls short in understanding trans issues. Davies added that during the recent memorandum row, the BACP told him it didnt want an ever-growing list of orientations and conditions. I thought it was insulting and outrageous to refer to trans and asexuality as a condition, he said. Theyre not conditions. They [the BACP] are very out of step. Last month a government report on transgender issues recommended numerous changes in treatment, including ways to de-pathologise trans people. In recognition of Davies work in the field of LGBT mental health, the BACP made him a fellow in 2007. But this was a hollow gesture, he said. View this image  Dominic Davies Its a tokenistic thing a nice pat on the back, but nothing happens. He added that when the BACP was embroiled in a landmark, high-profile case with one of its members, Lesley Pilkington, a therapist accused of conversion therapy, Davies was not consulted. No one contacted me from the BACP to say, What do you think we should do about this? Theres this arrogance that they think they know best. In his resignation blog post, Davies also criticised the BACP over its handling of the case both for taking over two years to resolve it, and for telling its members, after Pilkington was struck off, not to engage in conversion therapy, without providing any training for practitioners in how to respond when clients are unhappy being LGB or T. How are therapists supposed to be able to deliver competent and ethicaltherapy without specific training about gender, sexual and relationship diverseclients? he wrote on his blog. Davies also questioned what he called the monopoly he sees the BACP enjoying as a result of its prominence. Despite being a private body, many employers demand accredited membership of the BACP in job adverts, over and above other equivalent organisations, he said. View this image  Jacky Chapman Queer members who have been talking to me say they feel trapped in an organisation which doesnt represent their needs because they need to stay a member in order to get work, he said. Davies said he now plans to take up membership of the National Counselling Society, which will be signing the updated memorandum. In response to Davies comments. a spokesperson for the BACP provided BuzzFeed News with a statement: BACP has been involved in a working group, led by UKCP, that discusses the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Conversion Therapy in the UK and other important issues relating to it. The working group is considering proposals to revise the current MoU. The BACP Board will discuss these proposals in March. We cant comment in any detail until then, nor pre-empt the Board decision. BACP understands the principles that the proposed MoU is aiming to promote: at the same time, we understand that there is a debate about the evidence regarding conversion therapy and transgender issues. As an organisation that aims to make our policy and practice evidence-informed, the Board needs to consider this debate fully and carefully. BACPs intention is always to take a position consistent with our Ethical Framework, which offers clear parameters for good practice across a full range of client groups. Our existing position in relation to conversion therapy and our support for the current MoU remains unequivocal. Our position on a revised MoU will be made publicly available on the BACP website and in Therapy Today. We cant comment on issues around an individuals membership with BACP.

aS'The country, home to more of the worlds Muslims than any other country, has never seen this kind of showdown over LGBT rights. View this image  Indonesian President Joko Widodo. Darren Whiteside / Reuters Indonesias top Muslim organization renewed its call for the criminalization of homosexuality on Wednesday, the latest in a series of declarations that have made LGBT rights an unprecedented flashpoint in the politics of the country with the worlds largest Muslim population. We support the establishment of new regulations banning LGBT [sexual] activities and other deviant types of sexual intercourse and prosecution of those involved in LGBT activities and other deviant types of sexual intercourse, as well as parties that support, encourage or finance LGBT activities in Indonesia, said Maruf Amin, head of an umbrella organization of Muslim organizations called the Indonesian Ulema Council (abbreviated MUI), at a press conference in Jakarta. The MUI has called for homosexuality to be heavily punished before, including in an edict issued last March. But now it isnt making this call in isolation. High-ranking politicians have been pulled into an unusually drawn out debate about LGBT rights that comes at a moment of heightened concerns about religious politics in the country following an ISIS-organized terrorist attack in Jakarta last month. Just ahead of the MUIs latest statement, the countrys Minister for Politics, Legal and Security Affairs, Luhut Binsar Panjaitan, met with another of the countrys major Islamic organizations and reportedly pledged to work with the group on a policy for LGBT people. It is a real threat we have to deal with, Panjaitan reportedly said. We have to minimize impact in Indonesia, though he added, We must first agree that [LGBT people] are also Indonesian citizens. Though there have been some isolated showdowns over LGBT organizations with international links most notably a 2010 meeting of the Asian branch of the International Lesbian and Gay Association that was interrupted by religious protesters Indonesian authorities have not generally actively persecuted LGBT people. Unlike neighboring Malaysia, which routinely prosecutes transgender women under Sharia codes, Indonesia has been relatively tolerant of a long-standing transgender community called waria, and is home to a mosque and religious academy dedicated to serving them that has been widely covered by the media. (The one exception is in the territory of Aceh, which has a punishment of 100 lashes for homosexuality under hardline laws it adopted after a long battle for political autonomy from Indonesia.) LGBT issues became the center of national controversy in late January, when the cabinet minister responsible for higher education, Mohammad Nasir, was quoted as saying that LGBT organizations should not be allowed in the countrys universities, because they conflict with standards of values and morals. Shortly after, an extremist group known for violent tactics called the Islamic Defenders Front conducted a raid on boarding houses in the countrys third-largest city, Bandung, in which it claimed to have found same-sex couples and hung banners saying Lesbi & homo forbidden to enter into our region on the buildings they targeted. It at first appeared that Indonesias leaders wanted to snuff out this fight. Bandungs mayor, Ridwan Kamil, denounced the Islamic Defenders Front and ordered the banners removed. Education Minister Nasir disavowed his comments about LGBT student groups on Twitter, saying LGBT people deserve equal treatment in the eyes of the law. But top policymakers picked up the drumbeat. The countrys vice-president, Jusuf Kalla, called on the United Nations Development Program to stop funding LGBT rights work in the country. The countrys broadcasting regulators banned programing showing LGBT people to be normal and demanded messaging apps remove LGBT-themed stickers or emoji. The Communications and Information Ministry announced Wednesday that it would block Tumblr until it agrees to block pornography and LGBT content from being accessed in Indonesia, only to backpedal as Indonesias president, Joko Widodo, was on a visit to Silicon Valley. The growing crescendo has caught seasoned LGBT advocates and observers of human rights in Indonesia largely by surprise. After the initial dust-up over the university group, they expected the controversy would blow over quickly just as other incidents have done in the past. This is the first time its gone on this long, said Dd Oetomo of Gaya Nusantara, the countrys oldest LGBT rights organization and organizer of the 2010 conference interrupted by protesters. Its a moral panic. UPDATE This story has been updated to note the Indonesian governments reversal on blocking Tumblr.

Maya Newell, director of Gayby Baby, told BuzzFeed News the installation is a lovely bookend to the controversy that erupted over the film last year. View this image  Gayby Baby director Maya Newell. The photos were taken just days after Gayby Baby was unexpectedly catapulted into a nationwide media storm. Following newspaper reports that parents had complained about the film, it attracted a NSW-wide ministerial ban and kicked off a big debate over same-sex parenting. Newell says just the process of creating the exhibit was a positive healing process at the end of a week in which same-sex families were made to feel inferior. It says that we werent put down by it, that our stories werent put to bed by all that horror, she says. Each portrait includes a quote from the child in the photograph messages of support, says Newell, for situations exactly like the one that unfolded over Gayby Baby. Newell is particularly excited by the accessibility of the installation, which is co-presented by Gayby Baby and the Head On Photo Festival. Unlike the film, it wont just be seen by those who choose to see it thousands walk by Town Hall every day. Its the best possible visible spot in the whole city, she says. Thats whats wonderful about public art its accessible to everyone. If youre somebody who doesnt interact with the queer community very often, or youre just coming to work you have an opportunity to sit and interact and learn about gay families without much effort. Maya Newell Lane Sainty / BuzzFeed News She says the installation signals the increased capacity children of same-sex families now have to speak for themselves. The Christian right have always spoken on our behalf in negative ways, she says. I also think theres an element to which our parents generation have spoken on our behalf as a tool for LGBT advocacy. Im really glad they did that, because they were advocating for my rights as well. But the children of same-sex parents carry a unique perspective that hasnt been highlighted in the past. I often speak to gay parents raised in straight families, and they themselves have really deep-seated hangups about whether their kids are OK, because they were raised in straight society. But kids from my generation, theres this really exciting opportunity to hear from kids raised in queer culture. View this image  Lane Sainty / BuzzFeed News Whatever effect its had on gay families which I hope is positive in the long term weve had a national conversation about these families, she says. Now, you have to actually have been living under a rock to not know that these kids exist, and have done for generations. So thats a contribution that I feel proud of.

aS'They reckon a plebiscite would be damaging. View this image  David Mcnew / Getty Images  In an open letter, the 40 faith leaders said they feared a plebiscite could create division between faith communities and destabilise the place of religion in society. Polls have demonstrated that opinion on legalising same-sex marriage varies among people of faith. In fact most polls find that a majority favour change, the letter reads. Yet the negative case will be put by religious groups and leaders who claim to speak on behalf of people of faith generally, or religious institutions as a whole. The Australian Christian Lobby is one of the lead campaigning groups against same-sex marriage. Earlier this week, it called for anti-discrimination laws to be suspended during the plebiscite, saying the vote would not be fair otherwise. A volatile, public and politically-charged debate could both distance leaders from lay people, marginalise faith communities from broader society and alienate LGBTI individuals within religious communities. They also expressed worry that the plebiscite would cause harm to LGBTI Australians. After decades of legalised discrimination, and ongoing social stigma, LGBTI Australians will face an angry, drawn-out debate, one likely to multiply existing disadvantages and stigma, they wrote. View this image  Sebastien Bozon / AFP / Getty Images Most of the signatories are Christians, including Catholic, Anglican and Uniting leaders. Gregg Heathcote, a Buddhist chaplain from Newcastle, is also on the list. The marriage plebiscite is opposed by the Labor opposition, the Greens and lobby group Australian Marriage Equality. It is supported by most anti-marriage equality groups, including the Australian Christian Lobby, the Australian Marriage Forum and Marriage Alliance. CORRECTION Gregg Heathcote is a chaplain.

aS"If being queer is ~ so unnatural ~ why are there so many instances of same-sex behavior in the wild? View this image  Its common sense. Do you see animals mating with the same sex? he said. Animals are better because they can distinguish male from female If men mate with men and women mate with women, they are worse than animals. View this image  Obviously, no, we cant say if an animal is actually gay, bisexual, or what have you. When discussing animals in the wild, the term homosexual behavior is often used as an umbrella term for same-sex courtship, non-reproductive sex , pair bonding, and even parenting. Some species only display a few of these behaviors, while others take part in several and scientists are only beginning to understand both the evolutionary and genetic implications of same-sex behavior in the animal kingdom. Professor Paul Vasey, who studies Japanese macaque behavior, summed it up nicely when he said, You cant impose your perspective on the species youre studying. Attempt to understand the world on its own terms. View this image  There are countless stories of awesome same-sex parenting penguins. Roy and Silo, Chinstrap penguins like those pictured above, are one of the most well-known.The pair, both male, made headlines in 1999 after trying to hatch a rock at New York Citys Central Park Zoo. Zookeepers ended up providing the couple with a real egg which would hatch to become their chick, Tango. Sadly the couple would later break up, but nobody said love is easy.

The species has become infamous for their practice of using peace n love over violence to relieve tension. View this image  Rams have to be one of the gayest animals out there. No, seriously. Scientists have found that, besides humans, sheep may be the only species where males can express same-sex sexual preferences exclusively.

aS"HB 1008 seeks to ban transgender students from using school restrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their gender identity. The measure was passed by the state senate Tuesday after being passed by the state house last week. View this image  Republican state senator Brock Greenfield By a 1520 vote, the South Dakota state senate passed a bill on Tuesday to ban transgender students from using school restrooms that correspond with their gender identity. After passing the state house earlier this month, House Bill 1008 is expected to head to Gov. Dennis Daugaard in the coming days. Provided that he signs it, South Dakota would be the first state in the country to pass such a law likely teeing up a clash with the federal government, which has taken the position that such policies constitute illegal discrimination. Sen. Brock Greenfield said on the senate floor that the legislation is a response to the Obama administrations push for transgender rights in public schools. This issue has been thrust upon us by an activist group of bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., Greenfield said. Its only been a product of recent decisions made at the federal level. He cited constituent concerns about co-mingling of individuals of different birth sex, saying it was inappropriate. Do you feel it appropriate for a 13-year-old girl to be exposed to the anatomy of a boy? he asked. But Democrats criticized the bill in floor speeches, arguing the measure presented a slippery slope to further discrimination and could prompt the federal government to withdraw funding for South Dakotas public schools. Sen. Bernie Hunhoff insisted there were no incidents of transgender students causing problems by using school restrooms and the state could face retaliation. We could have egg on our face with a tourism boycott, Hunhoff added. House Bill 1008 states that every restroom, locker room, and shower room located in a public elementary or secondary school that is designated for student use and is accessible by multiple students at the same time shall be designated for and used only by students of the same biological sex. The bill defines biological sex as the physical condition of being male or female as determined by a persons chromosomes and anatomy as identified at birth. Although the measure does not mention transgender people specifically, the legislation is the latest in a national movement to ban transgender people from using restrooms that reflect their gender identity. Conservative organizations have united around a battle cry of banning men in womens bathrooms to push such policies in schools and to block or repeal LGBT nondiscrimination laws. Under Obama, the Departments of Justice and Education have argued that Title IX of the Education Act of 1972 which bans sex discrimination in publicly funded schools also bans transgender discrimination as a form of sex discrimination. The Justice Department weighed in to support a transgender student in the countrys most advanced lawsuit over student restroom access. Federal lawyers filed an amicus brief before the 4th Circuit Court in October backing Gavin Grimm, a transgender boy trying to overturn a school district policy that bans students from restrooms that dont reflect their biological gender. In South Dakota, the bill makes a gesture to providing a reasonable accommodation for transgender students such as providing a single-person restroom on the condition that it doesnt burden the school district. But that accommodation would not include allowing trans students to use restrooms that reflect their gender identity. Gov. Daugaards office did not immediately respond to a request to comment on whether he would approve or veto the bill. However, Daugaard said at a recent press conference, I have not met a transgender person that Im aware of. Sarah Warbelow, legal director at the Human Rights Campaign, told BuzzFeed News that for the time being, There is no state that bans transgender students from using facilities that correspond with their gender identity.

aS'Do you see animals mating with the same sex? the fighter turned politician said. View this image  Seth Wenig / AP Sports brand Nike ended its sponsorship deal with Manny Pacquiao on Wednesday after the Filipino boxer said people who are attracted to the same sex are worse than animals. Pacquiao, a member of the Philippines House of Representatives who is currently running for a Senate seat, made the controversial comments in a local television interview released Monday. Its common sense. Do you see animals mating with the same sex? he said. Animals are better because they can distinguish male from female If men mate with men and women mate with women, they are worse than animals. Facebook: video.php In a Facebook post on Tuesday, the conservative Christian initially defended the comments: I rather obey the Lords command than obeying the desires of the flesh. Im not condemning anyone, but Im just telling the truth of what the Bible says. However, just seven hours later, the former world champion made a follow-up post in which he apologized for hurting the LGBT community. Im sorry for hurting people by comparing homosexuals to animals, he wrote. Please forgive me for those Ive hurt. I still stand on my belief that Im against same sex marriage because of what the Bible says, but Im not condemning LGBT. I love you all with the love of the Lord. God Bless you all and Im praying for you. On Wednesday, Pacquiao sponsor Nike announced it no longer [has] a relationship with the boxer. We find Manny Pacquiaos comments abhorrent, a spokesperson told BuzzFeed News in an emailed statement. Nike strongly opposes discrimination of any kind and has a long history of supporting and standing up for the rights of the LGBT community. Forbes lists Nestl and Foot Locker as the boxers other major sponsors. Foot Locker representatives did not return a request for comment from BuzzFeed News, while a Nestl spokesperson said the company is not a current sponsor, having sponsored him briefly in 2015. Pacquiaos initial comments drew support from many in the Catholic-dominated country, but LGBT political party Ladlad condemned the remarks. To say that animals are better because males of the species sniff and have sex only with females of the species is to be ignorant of the fact that homosexuality is also found in all forms of creation from plants to animals, and yes, even to people, party chairman Danton Remoto said in a statement. This fact just goes to show that homosexuality is part of nature, and not some repulsive idea that the fundamentalist mind of Pacquiao finds perverse. This isnt the first time Pacquiao has drawn the ire of the LGBT community by making anti-gay comments. In 2012, he gave an interview with the National Conservative Examiner in which he spoke out against same-sex marriage. The interview included a reference to a biblical chapter about gays being put to death, but Pacquiao later denied he specifically quoted the verse.

aS"Ben Stillers comedy sequel struggles to make fun of a world it no longer understands. View this image  Benedict Cumberbatch and Kyle Mooney in Zoolander 2. Paramount Pictures Zoolander 2 is a dirge in the form of a halfhearted comedy, and its Benedict Cumberbatch who makes that most clear. In one of the more memorable of the sequels many celebrity cameos, Cumberbatch appears briefly as a genderqueer supermodel named All who has taken Derek Zoolanders (Ben Stiller) place as the hottest thing in fashion since the title character stepped out of the scene. The actor dons long hair, fur, and painted nails, his sharp-planed face made extra alien by the removal of his eyebrows. While Derek has matter-of-factly described himself as good-looking, really, really good-looking, or ridiculously good-looking, All resembles the imposing ruler of a dystopian ice planet who would never deign to be described by terms so mundane. All prefers the pronoun we and is not defined by binary constructs. Naturally, the first thing Derek and Hansel (Owen Wilson) do is ask if All has a hot dog or a bun, a wiener or a vaginer. Derek and Hansel are idiots. That was the central joke in Zoolander back in 2001. Fifteen years later, its nominally still the joke in Zoolander 2. The two male models emerge from tragedy and self-imposed exile into a world where All is the most in-demand face in fashion and no one is impressed by their dated stylings, which bewilders them. View this image  Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson in Zoolander 2. Philippe Antonello / Paramount Pictures At least in that first film, Derek and Hansel were more than just fools. Theywere comedy loopholes, a way for a team of straight guys to mine laughsfrom an industry dominated by beautiful women and gay men, by allowing themselves to be the main targets. Stiller sidestepped a lot of stereotypes and garden-variety punching down by making himself the butt of the joke, an oblivious good-looking doofus who never comprehended the extent to which the universe accommodated him until he encountered the possibility that the spotlight was moving on. And having Stiller and Wilson, two men whose attractiveness is decidedly not of the perfectly symmetrical, high-cheekboned variety, play these roles amplified the absurdity of how their characters were lauded. But Zoolander 2 which Stiller directed and co-wrote with Justin Theroux, Nicholas Stoller, and John Hamburg cant bring itself to really skewer its main characters for their vapidity anymore. It has too much sympathy for their fears of being out of the loop, keeping up with changing times, and getting left behind. Self-deprecation is easier when youre the one on top, but the fashion industry in the sequel is expressed through bits about how baffling its biggest trends are the eco-friendly hotel made of shit, the terminally ironic hipster designer (Kyle Mooney) who talks about his love of how terrible everything is, and the thudding spoof of fashions fondness for androgyny and gender fluidity that is All. That Cumberbatch sequence manages to crystallize all of Zoolander 2s off-target fumblings in one easy moment. Its a messy scene in which the joke quickly slides from Derek and Hansels cluelessness to squirmy panic, right before the three are due to hit the catwalk at a show. Sensing discomfort, the designer hones in on Dereks awkwardness, calling it into question, demanding proof of his acceptance: Does he have a problem with All? Wouldnt he be happy if his kid brought home someone like All to marry? Not that All is looking for a relationship, because All just married hermself. View this image  Kristen Wiig and Will Ferrell in Zoolander 2. Wilson Webb / Paramount Pictures Both Zoolanders include multiple gags about their main characters inclusive sexuality by throwing them into orgies with men, women, little people, and older folks, all of varying ethnicities. But the punchline there is Dereks and Hansels (mostly Hansels) well-practiced adventurousness their desirability is absolute and understood, and whats funny is who they choose to sleep with when everyone is there for the taking. The scene with All tries uneasily to contend with an idea of beauty that isnt directly measured by who its main characters however cosmopolitan might want to fuck. Its a concept the movie cant get its head around. Instead, on the runway, Derek and Hansel find themselves in shirts reading OLD and LAME, being whipped by a winged All swooping in from above like a figure out of the anxiety dreams of antipolitical correctness trolls. Zoolander earned its cult status by figuring out a way to make its satire absurd and sharp but never mean. It still resonates, as last years comparisons of Yeezy Season 1 clothing line to Mugatus Derelicte collection prove. That first film is more on point, a decade and a half on, than Zoolander 2, which feels like the product of people peering in from the outside at something they no longer understand not fashion, but comedy about a universe in which theyre no longer the center.

aS"Ashley Diamond said she was refused necessary medical care and repeatedly sexually assaulted in Georgia prisons. She was released on parole in August. View this image  Ashley Diamond Courtesy Southern Poverty Law Center A transgender woman inmate named Ashley Diamond has settled with the Georgia Department of Corrections, after filing a lawsuit last February alleging she had been denied hormone treatments and left unprotected from sexual assault in prison. Diamond, a nonviolent offender, was housed in male facilities with violent offenders for three years. Were really proud of what this case achieved, said Chinyere Ezie, an attorney for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which represented Diamond. It shows that black transgender lives matter, and that is utterly untenable from a financial and legal and moral perspective for prison officials to deny the humanity and rights of their trans inmates. A spokesman for the Georgia Attorney Generals office told the Associated Press on Friday that the state paid Diamond $250,000 in the settlement $225,000 to her and $25,000 to her lawyers. But in an interview with BuzzFeed News, the SPLC disputed that figure. The amount specified by the Attorney Generals Office is not an accurate representation of the final settlement award, Ezie said. Because the SPLC is bound by confidentiality, we are unable to disclose the total settlement amount. In an email, the Georgia AG spokesman maintained the final settlement amount was $250,000, declining to comment on the case further. Diamonds lawsuit forced drastic changes within the Georgia Department of Corrections. In April 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice publicly backed Diamonds underlying Constitutional claim concerning cruel and unusual punishment, condemning for the first time prisons that dont provide appropriate medical care for transgender inmates. Three days later, the GDC changed its policies, ending its freeze-frame approach. Before the change, inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria could maintain the level of transition at which they entered the prison system a level difficult for many to prove. For Diamond, who had been taking female hormones for 17 years prior to her prison sentence beginning in 2012, the old policy meant that she was deprived of what the SPLC has called medically necessary care. Her facial hair grew back, while her breasts disappeared and voice dropped. She said she attempted suicide and self-castration. Prison officials refused to recognize her identity, reprimanding her for being insufficiently masculine leaving her vulnerable to sexual assault by other inmates, which happened early and often, Diamond said. After one of these attacks, a prison lieutenant verbatim told Diamond it was her fault because she was transgender and accused her of sleeping with inmates and screaming rape at every camp she goes to, according to a witness. Georgias public reversal of the freeze-frame policy Diamond had been living under was a major development for transgender prisoners in the state. But four months later, in August 2015, the SPLC filed court documents showing the GDC wasnt following its own new policy Diamond, among others, was still being deprived needed treatment, the filing said, including female gender expression, an integral component of her care as confirmed by GDC medical professionals and other competent medical authorities. Five days after that filing, Diamond was unexpectedly released on parole, about three years into her 12-year sentence. And in September, a judge dismissed the state of Georgias efforts to dismiss the lawsuit. The SPLC says since Diamonds release, it has continued to monitor the policies implemented by GDC during the lawsuit, including a new sexual assault prevention policy. Ezie, Diamonds attorney, said shes been hearing positive feedback from current inmates. Were gladdened by those types of reports, she said, But our eyes and ears are always open for any signs that things arent proceeding as they should. Diamond, now 37, has a long road to recovery, Ezie said, but is tremendously strong and courageous and truly brilliant. And Diamond has said she wants to continue speaking out for transgender rights, as she did in prison. Six months before her SPLC lawsuit, Diamond managed to publish a series of 25-second YouTube videos from behind bars called Memoirs of a Chain Gang Sissy. My story is more than just about hormone care, she said in one clip. Its about the way society is treating human beings as a whole when we allow this type of violence to take place. In December 2014, Diamonds struggles in prison were highlighted in a BuzzFeed News feature about Zahara Green, another transgender inmate raped in a Georgia prison. In April 2015, The New York Times began covering Diamonds case at length. Also in April, Elton John and Michael Stipe issued a joint statement of support on behalf of Green and Diamond. youtube.com Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"A porn actor had condomless sex with 12 men while filming and five men off the set likely infecting another porn actor and a nonwork partner. View this image  AFP / Getty Images / Romeo Gacad A new Center for Disease Control report found that a porn actor likely infected another performer with HIV while having condom-less sex on a gay porn set leading the agency to warn that testing alone is insufficient to prevent the viruss spread in the adult entertainment industry. The agency advised performers to wear condoms and consider taking a drug that can prevent transmission. The incident involved a 25-year-old man who had tested negative for the virus in 2014, the CDC said in the report released Friday. Over the following weeks, the man had bareback sex with 17 other men 12 performers and five non-work partners. Referred to as Patient A, the man had apparently contracted HIV from a non-work partner, the report found, but HIV tests do not necessarily detect recent infections. The performer, having tested negative by nucleic acid amplification test within the preceding 14 days, and unaware of his very recent HIV infection, infected another performer and a nonwork-related partner, the report s summary explained. All four of the men were found to have a highly genetically related versions of HIV. This is the first well-documented work-related HIV transmission among male adult film performers, the CDC said. Patient A had a negative test shortly before he performed in a shoot, but in the 22 days between that test and finding that he was HIV positive, he was in two productions. None of the the actors in the first production was found to be infected, but an actor from the second production was infected. Patient A was showing symptoms during the second shoot. Patient A likely subsequently infected both a coworker during the second film production and a nonwork-related partner during the interval between his negative test and receipt of his positive HIV results, the report found. Neither production company is named in the report. None of the men in involved, including those who did not contract the virus, were taking preexposure prophylaxis a drug treatment known known as PrEP. Approved in 2012, PrEP is at least 92% effective at warding off new HIV infections when taken every day, and the CDC recently recommended it for one out of four gay men. Adult film performers and production companies, medical providers, and all persons at risk for HIV should be aware that testing alone is not sufficient to prevent HIV transmission, doctors for the CDC wrote. Condom use provides additional protection from HIV and sexually transmitted infections, they added. Performers and all persons at risk for HIV infection in their professional and personal lives should discuss the use of PrEP with their medical providers. HIV transmission has also been documented in straight porn. In 2013, a female performer was infected with HIV. The Free Speech Coalition, a Southern California-based adult industry group, called for a production moratorium after learning a performer tested positive for HIV.

aS"The 15-year-old sophomores were found Friday morning near the cafeteria at Independence High School in Glendale. View this image  Students walk to their parents after being released from lockdown at Independence High School. AP / Matt York Police say a shooting at an Arizona high school on Friday was a murder suicide involving two girls who were very close friends, appearing to also be in a relationship. Neither of the 15-year-old sophomores have been named by the Glendale Police Department. However, local media interviews with friends and family, as well as social media posts, indicate the girls are May Kieu and Dorothy Dutiel. Friends vented and grieved on social media accounts belonging to both the girls, who were seen together in past photos. One post by Kieu showed her and Dutiel together with the caption, My lover. View on Instagram Instagram: @lord Dutiels final post on Twitter was published Thursday, saying, Good bye (: A penultimate post the day before said, Rejected af. Good bye (: Rejected af At about 8 a.m. Friday morning, Glendale police responded to a 911 call at Independence High School, which has 2,000 students in the Phoenix suburb, and found the girls near the cafeteria area under a covered patio. The two teens had sustained single gunshot wounds and were declared deceased at the scene. A weapon was found near the two teens, said police in a statement provided to BuzzFeed News. The investigation has led detectives to believe this incident was a murder suicide. Although the investigation is not complete, the police statement added, investigators working the case say evidence found at the scene leads them to believe that one female took the life of the other female before taking her own life. During the processing of the scene, a suicide note was located. Information gathered by detectives reveal the two girls were very close friends, appearing to also be in a relationship. Kieus sister, Phuong Kieu, created a GoFundMe drive to raise money for her sisters funeral expenses. My sister May Kieu passed away at a high school shooting on Feb. 12th.

Arzner, an amazing old-school butch, managed to slip lesbian signals into many of her films during a time when outright queer storylines in mainstream films were more or less unthinkable (especially after the Motion Picture Production Code started imposing strict moral guidelines in 1934). Christopher Strong, a Pre-Code film, helped launch the career of a young Katharine Hepburn, who is famously rumored to have had many affairs with women. She plays Lady Cynthia, a gutsy aviator who is too occupied by her job to think about romance. While she eventually ends up having an affair with a man (played by Colin Clive) after her around-the-world flight, its her strained and emotional relationship with the mans wife that really bears our close attention. Plus Katharine Hepburn plays an independent career woman who rocks a decidedly masculine aesthetic, which is a total gift to the gays.

aS"The sportswear giant has added a new clause into its contracts for athletes that states sponsorship wont be affected if they announce theyre gay, bi, or trans. View this image  Paul Cunningham / Getty Images Adidas, the worlds second-largest sportswear company, has added a clause into its contracts with the sportsmen and women it sponsors spelling out that if they reveal publicly that they are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender, the contract will not be changed or terminated, BuzzFeed News can reveal. Robin Stalker, the chief financial officer of Adidas, revealed the move on Thursday at the first British conference dedicated to improving the visibility of LGBT people in sport. This clause reads: Adidas acknowledges and adheres to the principles of diversity, as this is a central part of the Adidas group philosophy. Therefore Adidas warrants that this agreement will neither be terminated nor modified in case the athlete comes out to the public as a member of the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community. Although in Britain it is illegal to fire someone because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, this is not the case in dozens of countries in which Adidas sponsors athletes including certain US states. The prospect of losing sponsorship deals has also long been regarded as a key factor in keeping sportspeople in the closet. View this image  Daniel Karmann / AFP / Getty Images Adidas, which is the largest manufacturer of sportswear in Europe, is a major sponsor of top-level athletes throughout the world, including hundreds of partnerships with individuals and teams across numerous sports such as football, rugby, and tennis. The German multibillion-pound company was also a sponsor of the conference in London, entitled Team Pride: Levelling the LGBT Playing Field. Stalker made the announcement moments before hosting a panel discussion with three sportspeople who have all publicly disclosed their sexual orientation: rugby player Keegan Hirst, boxer Nicola Adams, and footballer Casey Stoney. View this image  Paul Cunningham / Getty Images It comes two years to the day since Adidas announced that Olympic diver Tom Daley would be the new face of the companys NEO label. This deal was offered to Daley just weeks after he had revealed in a YouTube video that he was in a relationship with a man. The same week Adidas prevented customers from being able to put the words gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender on customisable trainers, in a bid to stop people abusing the system. BuzzFeed News contacted both Adidas and Tom Daley to comment on the contract clause about coming out but did not receive a response prior to publication.  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

The group argued that the drug maker, Gilead Health Sciences, is promoting an unauthorized use of Truvada, thereby violating the terms under which it was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The complaint called on federal officials to impose sanctions against the pharmaceutical company and make it stop running the ad. But several leading AIDS activists and health care experts rather than rallying behind the group are angry about the complaint. In interviews with BuzzFeed News, they called it spurious and patently false. I think it is a complaint that has no merit, Mitch Warren, executive director of the global AIDS-prevention organization AVAC, told BuzzFeed News. It works to undercut good AIDS education and outreach. Yet the size of AIDS Healthcare Foundation makes a complaint like this hard to ignore. As the Jan. 13 letter to the agencys commissioner explained, the organization reaches 570,000 patients globally and is the largest provider of HIV/AIDS medical care in the U.S. Truvada a lightning rod for debate and hope within LGBT circles was approved in 2012 for daily use as a preventative prophylactic, a treatment known as PrEP, to stave off HIV infection. It is up to 92% effective at warding off new HIV infections when taken daily, and the CDC recently recommended it for one out of four gay men. Despite the mounting scientific data, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation has been a consistent critic of PrEP, frustrating many in the HIV field who say that the groups outspoken naysaying could dissuade high-risk individuals from taking the drug. View this image  AHF President Michael Weinstein AP Images for AIDS Healthcare Foundation / Carlos Delgado When leading organizations are putting out really false information, Warren said, then it does set the fight back for people delivering services and back for people who want PrEP, or begin to think that PrEP isnt really the right thing. I dont think anybody in the AIDS community understands where they are coming from, he added. AIDS Healthcare Foundations message to the FDA, these critics say, also reinforces the groups pattern of moralizing against sexual promiscuity at the risk of public health. It is frustrating that AHF continues to ignore the fact that PrEP is a proven tool that if taken as prescribed will prevent HIV, Kelsey Louie, CEO of GMHC, a seminal advocacy group and HIV treatment provider in New York City, told BuzzFeed News by email. Yet instead this organization spends its time filing complaints on the drug manufacturer. The 37-second spot features J.D. Phoenix, a pornography actor who talks to the camera about gay men who have a lot of sex and like to party. Phoenix is seen at home, meeting another guy at a nightclub, and then back at home the next day taking Truvada. Before he goes to the nightclub, Phoenix also grabs a small bag of pills including some that look like they could be MDMA, the illicit drug known ecstasy or molly. The term party is also a well-known slang term for using methamphetamine. youtube.com According to the complaint, written by AIDS Healthcare Foundation President Michael Weinstein and sent to the FDAs acting commissioner, Stephen Ostroff, the television commercial portrays situational use of Truvada taken after having sex, rather than as part of a preventative daily regimen that was approved for use. The letter also claims that the commercial is silent on the issue of using condoms even though the FDA says PrEP is to be taken only in conjunction with other prevention measures, such as safer sex practices. Weinstein also argues the ad promotes illicit drug use and treats Truvada as a party drug. Gilead launched an ad campaign to mislead viewers into believing Truvada is safe and effective for use on a situational basis despite knowing that the drug is not approved for such use, Weinstein writes. He said this constitutes off-label promotion of the drug. But critics say the complaint is wrong on key facts. Despite AIDS Healthcare Foundations claim that the commercial is entirely and irresponsibly silent on condoms, one of the opening shots features Phoenix grabbing two condoms. Gilead also had no creative control over the ads content, according to Public Health Solutions, the organization that produced the spot, and the ad only ran online and not on television. Public Health Solutions, GMHC, and individuals interviewed for this article also said two elements of the ad indicate daily use, not situational use, of PrEP. Just before Phoenix takes the drug, an alarm alert on his phone reminds him to take it. He then takes a pill from a weekly pill-a-day container, which is filled with similar blue pills in other compartments. As such, GMHCs Louie said, the ad does not encourage off-label use of PrEP. Gilead did not respond to a request for comment from BuzzFeed News. But Gilead didnt influence the ads content, Mary Ann Chiasson, vice president of research and evaluation at Public Health Solutions, told BuzzFeed News. Her organization applied for a $150,000 grant from Gilead, and the proceeds were used for an ad campaign that included the commercial. Gilead supplied no input and had no veto power over the content, and the company never saw it before it was distributed, she said. We had creative control its not really a Gilead project. Its our project, Chiasson said. Asked to comment on the criticisms of his organizations complaint to the FDA, AIDS Healthcare Foundations Weinstein told BuzzFeed News by email only that debate is healthy. He also stood by the claim that the ad is silent on the use of condoms, despite a close-up shot of them being picked up. You would need a magnifying glass to see that, he said. Via youtube.com Via youtube.com Left: Phoenix is seen picking up a bag of pills and condoms. Right: He gets an alarm reminder on his phone to take PrEP, while the gay hookup app Grindr runs in the background. We are not opposed to individual use of PrEP, Weinstiein added. But what the organization opposes is the widespread use of PrEP in contrast with many groups and federal health officials, who advocate it be used by wide swaths of people at high risk for HIV infection. The bigger bone of contention with the commercial, it seems, is that it targets very sexually active gay men who may also engage in unhealthy behaviors. As Weinstein wrote in an email, I like to party = binging, which is inherently unsafe. But Chiasson of Public Health Solutions, who is also an epidemiologist who studies HIV, said the ads goal was connecting with those very people. If we are not reaching out to high-risk individuals, who should be taking PrEP? she asked. I think its a tragedy, a complete dereliction of our public health duty, not to reach out to them. We cannot ignore them if we ever want to stop the epidemic. The complaint is just one of AIDS Healthcare Foundations criticisms of Gilead and PrEP. As BuzzFeed reported in 2014, AIDS Healthcare Foundation began an ad campaign that cautioned against the widespread use of the PrEP for HIV. If this catches on as a public health strategy, that means there are going to be people who will take Truvada irregularly and some will be infected, and some develop drug resistance, it said. More recently, AIDS Healthcare Foundation ran an ad saying the treatment would prompt people to abandon the use of condoms in pursuit of sexual indulgence. In the debate surrounding PrEP, emotional appeals for sexual liberation have trumped medical science, the group said, adding that the group supports PrEP in the right setting. In Janaury, the group filed a lawsuit against Gilead relating to the patent on a different HIV drug. Box Turtle Bulletin described the FDA complaint as the latest in a campaign of deception. And the blog Plus, which covers HIV and AIDS, called it a bogus complaint aimed solely at preventing the use of PrEP. Kenny Neal Shults, principal consultant at Connected Health Solutions, which helped make the ad at the center of AIDS Healthcare Foundations complaint, said the groups claims are patently false. Sure, Id like men to use a condom every time, stop partying so much, settle down and find a nice husband but our job is to meet people where they are and supply them with methods for staying HIV negative, not to moralize and shun, said Shults. Its unclear how seriously the FDA will take the complaint. Sarah Peddicord, a spokesperson for the agency, said reviewers in the FDAs Office of Prescription Drug Promotion prioritize their work to focus on complaints about drug promotions with the most potential for negative impact on public health. She said the FDA receives hundreds of complaints about ads each year, but she could not speculate on any actions against Gilead. View this embed  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Living the single life, even when youre not single. View this image  Will Varner / BuzzFeed But thousands of married couples around the world live apart for short or long periods of time, for a variety of reasons: School, military service, work, family commitments, and immigration issues are among the most common. Being apart isnt necessarily a sign that something is wrong it can also mean that the couple is confident and committed. But that doesnt make it any easier when you come home after a long, shitty day and your spouse is 7,000 miles and 10 time zones away. After I put out a call for stories about long-distance marriages via the BuzzFeed Community, I received more than 300 responses from people who have spent (or are currently spending) an extended period of time living away from their spouse. Many experienced frustration and profound loneliness one woman said her and her husbands increasingly separate lives felt like a string being pulled apart from two ends. But the stories I got were, almost without exception, incredibly hopeful. Even though long-distance relationships have a (well-deserved!) reputation for being challenging, many said that being in a long-distance marriage was profoundly different from being in a long-distance dating situation. Instead of worrying about whether their relationship would survive, they focused on getting through it together. And nearly everyone I interviewed found more than just a silver lining to the experience they found a stronger relationship on the other side. Here are four of their stories. View this image  Will Varner / BuzzFeed Star and Louie are high school sweethearts who have been together since October 2006. They went to the same college and got married in March 2013. They have been living separately since the fall of 2014 while Star completes law school. Star: Going to Indiana University for law school was my dream since I was a little kid. I was applying to schools closer to where we lived in Texas; I toyed with a school in Dallas or San Antonio. But when I got into IU, it was the most obvious option for me since it was such a good school. I asked Louie what he thought about it, and he said, If you get accepted, you go, and well figure it out. Wed done long-distance during undergrad for internships. By the time law school happened, we were like, We can do this. Louie: When we got engaged, we started seriously discussing the type of lifestyle we wanted. It was very obvious to both of us that in order for us to achieve this, we would have to make sacrifices, and distance was the biggest of them all. As prepared as you think you are, though, it still sucks. Both my older brothers are enlisted service members. They are both happily married and their families make yearlong sacrifices when they are called for duty overseas. So my wife being in another state didnt seem like such a big deal compared to what our brave soldiers and their families do. Star: Weve both come to the conclusion that its best that were separated during this time. We went to college together, so we know what its like to want to stay home, miss a class, or take a drive together. It would probably be really difficult for me to commit and do good work in law school if he were here. I would procrastinate. Plus, he really wanted to make a good impression at work and be available to them. Louie: Almost every person I speak to about my wife being in another state for law school tells me Im crazy. They cannot comprehend how much we trust each other, and they all used to doubt that we would make it. Since shes been in school already a year and a half, they [co-workers] are now recognizing and realizing that it is possible. They still think that Im crazy for letting her go out to have drinks with friends, or that she is in organizations where she can be surrounded by men. The only people that have been positive and supportive are our families, but even they have said that what were doing is unheard of. Star: Right now, we see each other at least once a month, not including winter and summer break. Last semester, we were in a wedding in Las Vegas, and we wanted to save money, so we sacrificed seeing each other more so we could have a good time there. It was hard; wed gone about two months without seeing each other. When youre not together, how do you stay connected? Star: Mostly by phone. Were not big fans of FaceTiming, but we just got into a Sunday morning ritual where we get on FaceTime and drink coffee together. We text throughout the day. I have a lot of homework and reading and sometimes its really hard for me to talk to him because Im in meetings or the library, so itll be a short conversation, and thats kind of sad. Louie: I make sure to tell her good morning every day before I go to work, and we talk for about an hour before going to bed. View this image  Will Varner / BuzzFeed Does the distance create a financial strain? Star: Definitely. We have two rents to pay; we have to buy two sets of groceries. I also have our dog. Hes like our baby, and he comes with expenses. The main financial strain we have is the need to see each other. We decided before I left that wed try to see each other twice a month. We did that a lot my first year, but its pretty expensive to fly, and the drive is 15 hours. Its a pain. What emotional toll does it have on you? Star: It sucks. Its pretty sad; it comes and goes in waves. Being in law school is pretty miserable at times, and its hard to come home and not be able to cry on my husbands shoulder. That takes away from a relationship. A big part of a relationship is being in the same room and not having to say anything. Its hard falling asleep alone. Louie: Sometimes, Ill feel sad, and then Ill be angry. The sadness happens because when I come home from a long day of work, I would just like to see her or hug and kiss her, but I cant. Thats usually followed by anger that its BS that we have to make such a sacrifice, and I question whether we made the right decision. The hardest part is spending the weekends alone. I go do things to distract myself, but its not the same without her. Star: Not being able to help him through that is really hard. Louie: In the beginning, I felt selfish for staying and working in Texas instead of looking for something in Indiana. The frustration also comes and goes, only because I want to spend time with her and I cant. Star: It takes a toll, but when I see him, its rejuvenating. Overall, its going a lot faster than we expected. And our dog helps! I could come home miserable, and hes the happiest little light. Are there any ways you think its actually strengthened your relationship? Star: The distance makes us appreciate each other more, so its kind of a good thing. Louie: Its made me realize what I have and how I should never take her for granted. I also feel a deeper sense of love for her when I am with her. Distance makes you realize how bad you truly miss your spouse and how much love and respect there is in the relationship. I will admit it gets lonely, but you realize thats a small sacrifice for a long and prosperous future together. Star Chacon Star Chacon What do you miss the most about each other? Star: I really miss waking up to him, drinking two cups of coffee, and discussing something political or legal. Hes really interested in what Im studying, so hell bring up opposing arguments and we go back and forth about them. Louie: I miss the way she makes me laugh, our conversations and debates over a wide range of topics. Her overall quirkiness, I love it. I miss everything about her. Shes my best friend. What advice do you have for anyone in (or planning to be in) a long-distance marriage? Louie: Communication and trust is key for any distant relationship. You have to work at it, but it is possible. Star: Its totally possible. You hope you live a long enough life to say this was just a blink especially if its something so positive and something that contributes so much to the relationship. Its an investment to make. View this image  Will Varner / BuzzFeed Anna and Mel have been together for three and a half years, married for four months, and have never lived together or even lived in the same country. Anna: Mel and I met on Tumblr. When we started dating three years ago, we were already long-distance. Being a lesbian couple, we definitely had a hard time getting married. I couldnt go to Canada, where it was legal to get married, as getting a visa was tough, and we couldnt get married in the Philippines because same-sex marriage wasnt legal. We decided to get married in New Zealand, where it was legal and would be recognized, but we could only stay for a week as we had to go back to our respective countries and attend to our jobs. We got married on Oct. 27 and we had to go our separate ways on Nov. 2. Basically, since we got married, weve only been together physically for six days. Mel: At the beginning of our separation, I really didnt feel any different, but as time goes by, you realize how much you want her to be with you already so you can start your married life together. Getting married meant that I could sponsor her as my spouse, and it can make the process faster so we can finally be with each other and start our lives together. View this image  Kate Wark katewark.co.nz Anna: Since Mel and I have been long-distance since we started dating, were already used to being away from each other. I guess the biggest factor that differentiates a marriage from a relationship is the fact that were now more certain about our future together. We no longer have break-up tendencies and were more bent on making it work. The Canadian visa process is long and complicated; Anna submitted a sponsorship application in November 2015, as well as their marriage certificate, photos, copies of plane tickets, and more. They are hoping to be reunited in Canada in September or October of this year. Mel: I see Anna every year, for a month or so. I am a chef, and luckily, my work approves my one-month leave since Ive been working at that restaurant for a long time. This year, Im not going to the Philippines because in just a few months she will be coming here for good. We stay connected mainly with Blackberry Messenger and FaceTime. Also, social media like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. help. Mel: The hardest part is always that heart-shattering airport goodbye. We have to do it every year. It doesnt get easier. The first three days when I go back here in Canada are always the worst. The heartache we both go through after spending time together and not knowing whats next for us strains our relationship. Anna: Its very hard to be alone all the time. You have to do everything on your own and its difficult not to be jealous when around other normal couples. There are times Id ask myself, Why do they have it so easy and why do we have it so hard? We try as much as possible to talk to each other about our feelings, but to be honest, sometimes words are never enough. When youre together, arguments are easier to end. You can just come over, kiss and make up. In a long-distance marriage, that doesnt work. When youre a normal couple, silence is normal, you dont talk all the time. In a long-distance one, its more uncomfortable and makes you think somethings wrong. Mel: Im always scared that she might get used to the fact that Im not with her. I dont want her to forget how it feels when were actually together. Anna: The time difference makes it harder. Sometimes I need my wife, but shes not available at the moment because shes either at work or sleeping already, and the same goes for her. There are times when you just wish to be a normal married couple. Are there any ways you think its actually strengthened your relationship? Mel: I think the distance made us unbreakable. Even though its unbearable at times, it made us realize how much we truly love each other and what sacrifices we would make just to be together. Anna: We learned to be more sensitive to each others feelings and weve learned to really make time for each other. Since were apart, we tend to be more vocal about our feelings, so we can fix our misunderstandings right away. I guess the best thing the distance has taught us is the fact that were really made for each other and that our love is indeed a choice. Staying together is a choice, and so is making this marriage work. The best surprise in this relationship is how we try to make each other feel loved. From simple calls to grand gestures like sending surprise cakes, flowers, pizza, etc. to each other, we never fail to express how much we love each other. Gestures that seem like too much for others are the only way for us. Whats been your biggest source of support during this time? Mel: I made myself busy with work. Also, support from the people around me. My family and friends always tell me not to worry about it too much because time will pass by so fast, and before I know it, I will be on a plane to go and see her again. Anna: My family and friends. Were both out to our families and they accept and love us. When I feel lonely, all I have to do is surround myself with the people I love and I feel fine again. Were lucky that we have a very loving support system. View this image  Will Varner / BuzzFeed What advice do you have for anyone in (or planning to be in) a long-distance marriage? Mel: Its not for the weak. It takes everything you have to make it work at times, but in the end, its all worth it. In just a matter of months, we will be ending the distance and I cant wait. Its everything Ive ever wanted. I think when you meet someone and they are on the other side of the world, there are only two choices: You stop immediately, or you move mountains to make it work. There is no half-assed way of doing it. You have to give it your all to keep the love alive. Anna: Love is always worth it. Distance is just a test. If you really see a future with someone, even if shes living 13,000 km away, then by all means, do everything to make it work. View this image  Will Varner / BuzzFeed Tina and Jesse have been together for five years and married for nearly three and a half years. Both were active duty in the military; Jesse has been deployed to Afghanistan twice, and Tina has been deployed once. They were in separate locations in Afghanistan for a majority of 2013. They have spent about one and a half years of their marriage apart (not all of it consecutive) and currently live together while they both attend grad school. Tina: We were both in ROTC at Western Illinois University, and had committed to serving active duty after we graduated. We were friends, and it was one of those things where he liked me and I had no idea. Out of the blue one day [in December 2010], he told me he liked me, but hed graduated and moved to Arizona and I was still in college. I had done a long-distance relationship before, and it didnt work out. So I turned him down because of that. But we kept talking, and after I visited him in Arizona for a weekend, I knew I had to pursue this more. Committing to a long-distance relationship was risky because the Army is so unpredictable; I couldve gotten stationed in Germany, Korea, etc. We agreed to live in the moment and see what happened. Jesse: Tina and I dated long-distance for about 14 months [starting in February 2011]. Actually, our whole relationship was long-distance aside from the times that we would visit each other. Even the first eight months of our marriage was done long-distance. Tina and Jesse got engaged in April 2012, halfway through Jesses first deployment to Afghanistan, and married in a small civil ceremony six days later. Jesse: When we were apart but both in the U.S. for training, we tried to see each other every month to six weeks, but that would depend on both of our schedules. When we were deployed at the same time [beginning in April 2013], we were able to see each other once a month, as part of Tinas job required her to travel to where I was located, but she would normally arrive in the morning and leave in the evening, and we both still had to work, so we mainly spent time eating lunch and/or dinner together. Tina: Theres no PDA allowed in the military, so when we visited each other in Afghanistan, we couldnt hug, kiss, or hold hands. Thered be a friendly punch on the shoulder or something just so we could have some physical contact, so that was really hard. We couldnt do the things we wanted to when you havent seen each other in a while. Tina Turner Tina Turner When you werent together, how did you stay connected? Tina: I sent him a card every week during his first deployment; Im a huge card person. I also vacuum-sealed and sent him mini muffins and his favorite food, Subway cookies. Id also put movies like 21 Jump Street into care packages, which I know that he and everyone else on his base loved. When he was over in Afghanistan, we would try to Skype when the connection was decent. I could only see the outline of his head sometimes, and it was really delayed, but it was something. A lot of our communication was over email, and then hed call me on Sundays to talk. We were planning our wedding during that time, and the time difference made it hard to get an immediate response for time-sensitive decisions. Hed say, Do whatever you want, its fine! Jesse: We tried to talk every day if we could. When we were deployed at the same time we were in the same time zone, so talking on the phone was very easy to do. Tina: When we were both deployed, we could talk on a secure telephone line, so we could really discuss what was going on. When only he was gone, the line wasnt secure, so wed have to worry about what we could say. He could only say fine about his day, which made it really hard to feel connected. How did being apart affect your sex life? Tina: I waited to have sex until marriage, and we didnt have an official church wedding until after Jesse got back from his first deployment, eight months after our courthouse ceremony. During those months it was fine, because I didnt know what I was missing. But after the wedding, it was really hard. It was like giving a kid a sucker and then taking it away. To be honest, when I was deployed, it was the last thing on my mind. Being over there, doing the things youre doing and seeing, it takes away that desire. When we finally could have sex again, it rekindled everything and made it a little better, actually. What emotional toll did being apart have on you? Tina: The hardest time by far was the first time he was deployed, because I didnt know what it was like over there yet. It was hard not knowing what was happening. I couldnt pick up a phone and call him and say, Hey, how are you? Are you safe? If we set a phone call time for 11 and he didnt call by 11:30, I would worry that something happened. Worrying about his safety was by far the hardest. Being apart in the States for training was hard, but this was worse. I was afraid to turn on the news. Jesse: It can be very distracting, because somehow when youre apart every little thing reminds you of them, so trying to keep it off your mind is nearly impossible. It was hard not to come home to Tina at the end of the day, or have her there when I had a particularly stressful day. I missed hearing her laugh in person. View this image  Will Varner / BuzzFeed Tina: I did think it was going to be a lot harder than it was, based on my previous relationship. My ex was emotionally abusive, and I had to pull teeth to talk to him every few days. Jesse is extremely understanding and supportive and has given me a lot of confidence. Because of him, I was surprised at how easy it was. But I think were kind of an exception. Since they both returned from Afghanistan in 2013, Tina and Jesse have been living together in Illinois. Theyve spent periods of two to six weeks apart for training, and will go long-distance again this summer, when Jesse leaves for an internship in Denver. What was it like readjusting to living with each other again? Jesse: Getting to know each others little quirks that we may not have noticed when we were together for just a weekend was definitely part of the adjustment. Tina: When Jesse moved in with me Id been living in my own place for almost a year, so it sort of felt like he was moving into my space. I had to make room for his stuff, give up some of the closet. I knew where everything was supposed to go. Eventually, I realized it didnt matter where the pot gets left on the stove, because we were together again. Are there any ways you think its actually strengthened your relationship? Tina: It brought us way closer together. It forced us to talk more and have deeper conversations at the beginning of our relationship, before he was deployed. It got us talking about things that dont normally come up in regular conversation. It was a [emotional] burden being apart, but it wasnt a burden on our relationship. Jesse: We learned so much about each other that I think we got closer than we would have if we had been together. It proved to me that if we could make it through long distance, sometimes on opposite sides of the world, we could make it through anything. What advice do you have for anyone in (or planning to be in) a long-distance marriage? Tina: The two most important things are trust and communication. Itll never work if you dont trust them or they dont trust you. The Army is a very male-dominated work force, so if he got jealous every time I was with another man, hed go crazy. Always make time for each other, even if youre both busy and its just a five-minute phone call before bed. The longer you go without talking, the more disconnected you become. What I tell my friends when theyre facing a deployment is to always think of the other person. Do things for them, even if its just a card or a care package. Now, when were together, I still do things like that. Jesse: Be respectful and understanding of each others schedules, trust each other, and communicate often. Im not going to lie and say that its not that bad, because it does suck. There were times that I missed Tina so much that it physically hurt. Suddenly, nothing in the world matters because you arent with the person you love. I would have given up every material possession I owned to get to see her. View this image  Will Varner / BuzzFeed Jacqueline and Patrick have been married for 21 years. They spent 14 months living apart, beginning in March 2013, while Patrick started a new job. Jacqueline stayed home in Mercer, Wisconsin, with the couples two daughters to sell their house and wait for their eldest to finish high school. Jacqueline: I didnt mentally prepare for our separation. I was so excited to go [to South Carolina], I was thinking, Well have nice weather, and we wont have to dig out of 300 inches of snow every year! The first two weeks he was gone were fine, but after a month, I realized he was really gone. We had already been married for 21 years, so moving away from each other kind of felt like a death, in a weird sort of way. We only saw each other three times. We planned for more, but with work requirements and kids, we saw each other just for three holidays. Even though we got to talk, it was like we were in mourning. How did you stay connected? Jacqueline: We talked every day, sometimes a couple of times a day. It was constant contact; we never went a day without talking. We talked over the phone, mostly. We did text, but we would try to talk and hear each others voices. We Skyped sometimes, but not too much. What emotional toll did the separation take on you? Patrick: We grew apart. At some point, the excitement of being apart became very boring. Every day was the same: You go to sleep, you work, watch TV, then call each other before bed. The conversations were similar every day; wed talk about the day, then the kids. The conversations became shorter. It was all tough. Jacqueline: It was all over the board. We were trying to sell a house, my daughter was graduating high school; it was emotional. There were days where I would get into my car on the way to work, have my cry session, and then be fine. You get into a routine where you just accept that theyre far away. It made my husband and I stronger. The hardest part was feeling like he wasnt there for important moments and it was up to me to make all the decisions. I wasnt questioning our love, but the demands of being the sole present parent were hard. View this image  Will Varner / BuzzFeed Patrick: I missed just being together and seeing smiles, laughing together, and talking. I missed knowing what each of us were saying and not confusing language through text. How did it affect your children? Jacqueline: We have two teenage daughters. For them, it was an intense feeling of missing. Its like part of you is lost. They missed their dad, and I became the primary parent. When we started living together again, our daughters would ask me everything. He said, They dont come to me, its like Im invisible. They love their dad, but they were like, Moms the one thats been here. Jacqueline and Patrick have been living together in South Carolina with their younger daughter since June 2014. What was it like readjusting to living with each other again? Jacqueline: Going back to not having to juggle everything by myself was harder than I expected. But when we got back together, it was like when we first started dating. It was kind of neat. He has a quirky, weird sense of humor, and I missed that. Patrick: We had to fall in love all over again. Being apart really made us aware of the weaknesses in our marriage. We never stopped loving each other, but some of the spark that drew us together in the first place was gone. When we got back together, we had to reignite the spark and make changes in our relationship to turn weaknesses into strengths. It was more work than just puppy love. We also had to gain and build trust, which was hard. The trust problems existed prior to leaving. Neither of us ever cheated or strayed, it was more like we had to make sure we trusted that the marriage is what we both wanted and we were committed to making it work. That took time. We both loved each other, but we had to make sure that was enough to make it work. We established a much closer communication style and opened up to each other more deeply than ever before. Now, things are better than ever. Jacqueline: He was probably a lot lonelier than I was. I still had my friends around; I still had my kids. I missed him a lot, but I was busy. He came home to an empty apartment. I was more sad for him than for myself. I wouldnt do it again, but we did it for his career and what we thought would be best for our family. View this image  Jacqueline Wiedower Were there any aspects of living apart that were easier than you expected? Jacqueline: I like my alone time. It was kind of nice that I was able to read more. I had a lot more girlfriend time, which I didnt always get a lot of after I got married. I made my own schedule, and I kind of liked that I didnt have to check with anybody. Part of it made me stronger in ways that I didnt know I could be. Having to take care of the kids and selling the house by myself definitely made me stronger. Patrick: I got in lots of golf and exercise, had TV nights, and made friends. They helped me kill time physically, but not emotionally. It made me look at myself and the path I was on and I turned to God. Since that day, every day with her has been better. What advice do you have for anyone in (or planning to be in) a long-distance marriage? Patrick: Establish hobbies or projects that you can both do so you have more to talk about and continue to do once youre back together. It will eliminate the awkward conversations about how their day was. Jacqueline: Make sure you talk every day. Remember why you got married, and hold on to what bound you together.

aS"Gay manual? View this image  The Australian An article titled Activists push taxpayer-funded gay manual in schools was splashed across the front of Wednesdays newspaper complete with an exclusive stamp. Sounds big, right? But the article in question details a teaching guide released in November that is publicly available online and part of an ongoing program the Safe Schools Coalition that enjoys bispartisan support. And the new editor of The Australian is Paul Whittaker the same man who, as editor of the Daily Telegraph, launched a campaign against Gayby Baby, a documentary portraying the reality of living in a same-sex family. View this image  Daily Telegraph So, with all that in mind, you may have some questions about Safe Schools, and the reaction to it. First things first: Safe Schools resources dont encourage kids to be gay. This is because you actually cant convince someone who isnt gay to be gay in the same way you cant convert a gay person to being straight. But even going beyond the inevitable lack of nuance when it comes to headline writing, All Of Us is a teaching manual. Its publicly available for download, and contains eight lessons focused on different young LGBTI people, asking students to consider the issues through the lens of these young people and their lives. Yes, these lessons explicitly imply that LGBTI people exist and ought to be treated with respect. And they do encourage students to bring LGBTI topics into the classroom for discussion where such issues have long been ignored or treated with disdain. For instance, its suggested that students consider sexuality and gender in their music or art assignments, while another lesson encourages students to put themselves in the shoes of a young LGBTI person and consider what it might be like to have to hide a huge part of your life. View this image  Safe Schools I really wish someone had used the word transgender, or gender diverse, or any of those words when I was at school, one participant said. What Ive seen now is that a lot of young people are aware of these terms, theyre able to be out at school. If you have an exceptionally broad view of activism one that includes the federal department of education, for instance then sure. But otherwise, probably not. The program is supported by education minister Simon Birmingham, and was supported by Christopher Pyne before him. It enjoys the strong support of the Labor opposition too, along with the Greens. View this image  Safe Schools Peak Australian mental health bodies Beyond Blue and Headspace also advocate for the program, as does the Australian Secondary Principals Association. Australian Human Rights Commissioner Tim Wilson has also lent his support to the program. Todays article in The Australian quotes one dissenting voice, Wendy Francis from the Australian Christian Lobby, who has long been on the record advocating against the program. The Safe Schools manual appears to reach beyond promoting tolerance, to advocating activism by students, reads the article in The Australian. But the only example given of the activism students are encouraged to take part in in their schools is to put up posters. And even then, the advice is measured. If the schools dont allow students to put up the posters, they are asked to question why, and assess for themselves whether the reasons given are reasonable. View this image  Minus18  View this image  Via safeschoolscoalition.org.au The launch of the teaching guide was comprehensively covered by Fairfax. And its hardly new that the Australian Christian Lobby opposes the Safe Schools Coalition. Last year alone they called for the program to be defunded, ran a campaign against a resource that wasnt actually part of the program, and issued countless press releases railing against the program. Heres a little definition of exclusive from the Macquarie dictionary: a story which is in the possession of only one newspaper, television or radio station.  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"BuzzFeed News speaks with a 28-year-old who fled his familys efforts to kill him in Iran hoping Australia would protect him. Instead, the country sent him to a place that feels just as dangerous. Mohsen was crushed the day his possum died. The possum, whom hed named Tcho, had never been a particularly good pet. The animal resisted his captivity in Mohsens small room, peeing everywhere and biting Mohsen as he slept. But Tcho was at least a kind of company on the Pacific island that had been a prison for this 28-year-old refugee for more than two years. It kept biting me until the day it died, Mohsen said. But sometimes it would listen to me. In 2012, Mohsen, who is bisexual and a Christian convert, fled his home in Iran after his uncle hit him with his car and, when he survived, vowed to finish him off. View this image  Mohsens pet possum. Mohsen was hoping to take shelter in Australia, but the boat smuggling him to its shores was stopped at sea. Now he is trapped on Papua New Guineas Manus Island. He has has twice been beaten by off-duty immigration officers in the past year and is now afraid to leave his room. The locals seem frighteningly foreign to him: Possums like Tcho are slaughtered and eaten, and the locals chew something that stains their mouths the color of blood. Mohsen is one of more than 1,300 asylum seekers that Australia has sent, since 2012, to what is called the Manus Island detention center. Its a facility for single men and teenage boys; several hundred women and families are being detained 1,300 miles to the east on the island nation of Nauru. They were all captured at sea while trying to reach Australia by boat from Indonesia, under a policy that even the United Nations secretary general has personally pleaded with the Australias prime minister to bring to an end. Canberra calls this the Pacific Solution to the problem of people attempting to get to Australia by boat. Those it cannot force back into international waters it holds in camps outside its borders in an attempt to prevent them from asserting the right to asylum on its territory. Government officials have justified the policy as a way to discourage people-smuggling, and the countrys High Court upheld the constitutionality of the offshore detentions in a ruling issued on Wednesday that clears the way for 267 people including 91 children to be returned to Nauru after a period in Australia for medical care. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull applauded the ruling and vowed to continue the policy, saying that it ensures that our borders are secure. Conditions at the Manus Island detention center are so bad that human rights advocates have alleged they violate international law. Amnesty International described it as resembling a combination of a prison and a military camp. Human Rights Watch compared it to Guantanamo Bay. The center even included a shower block that guards had allegedly nicknamed the rape dungeon, according to an account from someone who worked in the camp until early 2014. Theres an added fear for queer asylum seekers like Mohsen. They worry about being targeted by others in the camp, who are mostly from Iran and other countries where homosexuality is criminalized, including Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. They also are afraid of Papua New Guineas police force because the countrys laws punish homosexuality with up to 14 years in prison. This place is no better than Iran, Mohsen said. I wish I had died on that boat 100 times a day. View this image  This photograph shows injuries Mohsen said came from a beating by Papua New Guinea immigration officers in June 2015. Mohsen Mohsen left Iran after his uncle hit him with his car, the culmination of more than a decade of abuse that began when he was 13. It began when his family learned hed had sex with another boy. Things got worse after he converted to Christianity in his early twenties. His father and uncles were high-ranking members of the police force in their province on Irans border with Iraq, and he said they once had him imprisoned and tortured for more than two weeks after his conversion. (Mohsens account could not be independently confirmed; his last name is withheld due to security concerns.) Now he believed they meant to kill him. His uncle only succeeded in breaking his arm with his car, but he called Mohsen to make clear he wasnt done: Next time will be different you will not escape from death. Within days, Mohsen had sold the two stores he owned and all his possessions to buy a ticket to Indonesia; there he paid a smuggler $30,000 to get him across the Indian Ocean to Australia. He handed over the cash on the day he arrived in Jakarta, only for the smuggler to disappear. After a day passed without the smuggler answering his calls, Mohsen saw on Facebook that he had changed his profile picture to show him holding a stack of cash, and Mohsen knew hed been robbed. He had all the money in his hands so I understood what had happened, Mohsen said of the photo. I was left behind with not even a dollar, not knowing any language. He scraped by doing sex work, but later was able to pick up some cash running errands for other refugees who were too afraid to leave their hotel rooms while waiting for their boats. Thats how he finally got a lucky break: He knew a family whod paid for the trip but who got cold feet at the last minute. He was able to board the ship for free by pretending to be one of them. He remembers there being around 100 other refugees from Iran on the boat, which started leaking three days into the journey. He saw the passengers bailing water break out in boils from urine and vomit that polluted the water gathering in the hull. But though it looked like they would sink, Mohsen said he was never afraid; he was drunk. Hed brought six bottles of liquor to get through the trip, but he was still jealous of ones who had passed out altogether from the stress of the journey. He downed the last shot when he saw an Australian boat sail to their rescue after their fifth day at sea. I told myself all the miserys over, he said. I knew whatever was waiting for me was better than the past. Mohsen was wrong. View this image  An Australian navy boat comes alongside a boat carrying 50 asylum seekers in August 2011. Reuters Manus Island is the northernmost large island belonging to Papua New Guinea, more than 600 miles from the northern tip of Australias mainland. Its largely covered by rainforest and sparsely populated by about 50,000 people its largest town, Lorengau, is home to only around 6,000. Guidebooks say Manus once had a tourist industry built around scuba diving, but today it is known primarily as a holding pen for asylum seekers Australia does not want. Australia and Papua New Guinea want the outside world to see as little of Mohsens home as possible. It is very difficult for foreign journalists to get official permission to visit Manus Island, so Mohsen spoke to BuzzFeed News by Skype. Mohsen has been outspoken about conditions on Manus. He pressed charges against the officers he said first beat him last year and has given interviews to Australian reporters. But this is the first time hes spoken publicly about the experience of being a queer refugee. He has more freedom since being officially recognized as a refugee in 2015 and allowed to leave the detention center, he said, so he feels able to speak up on behalf of those still locked inside. But with no hope of getting off the island, he also feels he has nothing left to lose by coming out publicly. The only one having access to a phone and is out of [the detention center] is me. I could talk about all the things happening there those who were killed and what we were going through, Mohsen said. This is why he agreed to talk when he first learned BuzzFeed News was working on this story through a contact in Iran. The fact that I am Christian puts me in danger, the fact that I am bisexual puts me in danger, the fact that I am here puts me in danger. What can make this worse? The detention center itself where all the other known queer refugees are still living is almost entirely closed off to the outside world. An Australian law even threatens jail time for employees who reveal details about what goes on inside its walls. View this image  An Afghan man carry a banner reading the behaviour of the Australian government is a black sign in the history of the human rights in December 2002. Reuters The roots of the Pacific Solution lie in a standoff that took place in August 2001 involving a group of 430 Afghan refugees. Theyd been rescued by a Norwegian freighter after their boat became stranded in the Indian Ocean. The Australian military boarded the freighter to prevent it from bringing the Afghans to an Australian territory called Christmas Island. Most of this group was then sent to Nauru, some remaining there for three years. Fears of terrorism helped turn the ad hoc approach into law. Legislation was adopted shortly after 9/11, and then-Defense Minister Peter Reith helped sell the proposal by warning that the boats could be a pipeline for terrorists. The Pacific Solution allows Australia to claim it is upholding international human rights law while still turning away people with credible asylum claims. Key to this is making sure they never set foot on Australian land many rights under international and national law only begin once someone has already entered a countrys territory. Maintaining this premise has required the Australian government to also re-interpret what counts as its territory. The government claims that Christmas Island, where refugees are processed before being sent to Manus or Nauru, doesnt count as part of Australia for immigration purposes even though it is a territory wholly under Australias control. This approach gives Australia one of the harshest policies toward asylum seekers of any developed democracy, say human rights activists. Its a pariah nation in terms of refugee protection, Human Rights Watch Australia Director Elaine Pearson, who visited Manus last June, told BuzzFeed News. Australia stands out for the numbers of asylum seekers it holds offshore, but it didnt invent the idea. The U.S. used similar logic in the 1990s when it held around 300 HIV-positive Haitian asylum seekers for two years at its base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the same place that would later hold detainees in the War on Terror outside the reach of U.S. courts. View this image  Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott Stefan Postles / Getty Images Australia has gone a step further, however. Not only do refugees on Manus Island spend years in a horrific detention center, their asylum applications are processed in Papua New Guinea instead of Australia. (Papua New Guinea, meanwhile, expected to benefit from several million dollars in aid from Australia as well as the jobs the detention center creates for Manus residents.) This means that LGBT asylum seekers are being forced to seek asylum in a country that criminalizes homosexuality, which human rights advocates say is a direct violation of prohibitions in international law against deporting people to places where they have a well-founded fear of persecution. I thought Australia and its people would be my protector, but they taught me otherwise, wrote one gay Iranian in the detention center in a set of letters published by The Guardian in 2014. Another wrote, I sought asylum from [the] Australian government which claims to respect the human rights [but] I am a homosexual, a gay man, and because of that I was tortured here and no one is hearing me to help. The United Nations has condemned the camps as a form of mandatory detention that violates international law, and problems in the camps like riots and rape have been extensively reported. Australias immigration minister declined to be interviewed for this story through a spokesperson, but Australian leaders appear more enthusiastic than ever about the plan. Both major parties intend to campaign on continuing the program in the next election. Some Australian leaders are even arguing it should be a model for the world as Europe is overwhelmed by refugees arriving in the hundreds of thousands from the Middle East and North Africa. The only way to prevent a tide of humanity surging through Europe and quite possibly changing it forever, said former Prime Minister Tony Abbott in an October speech in London, means turning boats around for people coming by sea and it means establishing camps for people who currently have nowhere to go. View this image  A candlelight vigil in support of asylum seekers, in Sydney in February 2014. Muhammad Farooq/AFP / Getty Images The situation in the Manus Island detention center was so bleak that Mohsen said he attempted suicide multiple times during the two years he was held there. Even now, he said, There is not a minute that I do not think about ending this life. The facility where he lived was meant to be temporary and hold fewer than 500 people. But the number climbed to more than 1,300 over the course of 2013. That was thanks largely to a new program announced while Mohsen was at sea July 19 that refugees sent to Manus would be eligible for asylum only in Papua New Guinea rather than Australia. Mohsens new home was a muddy compound penned in by a chainlink fence about eight feet high. Pictures from inside the facility leaked by asylum seekers or captured surreptitiously by the press show modified shipping containers, tents, and tin-roofed concrete buildings built during World War II crowded with asylum seekers in the tropical heat. The refugees would have had a view of the beach a few yards away, but when Amnesty International visited in 2013 the sea view was blocked by green mesh that a camp official said was to prevent the media from using boats to photograph conditions inside. A 2014 report by an Australian Senate committee collected extensive testimony about the horrors in the camp: The toilets backed up, dead flies were found in the food, there were suspicions that the guards were urinating in drinking water, and detainees sometimes got heat stroke because they had to wait in long lines for food without shade in direct sun. Mohsen said there was also extensive abuse at the hands of Australian security contractors and Papua New Guinea immigration officers, and the Australian Senate committee heard accounts of similar incidents. One of the most disturbing testimonies came from Nicole Judge, who worked on programs in the camp run by the Salvation Army during the second half of 2013. She reported witnessing Australian guards with the United Kingdom-based security company managing the camp, G4S, beat an Iranian unconscious after he ran back to his room to take cover from a rainstorm, an attempted invasion of the camp by locals from outside who used machetes to sever water lines, and evidence of sexual assault that security officials ignored. I have heard P1 [shower] block in Foxtrot [compound] being referred to by G4S guards as a rape dungeon, she wrote. In one case she saw reported seeing a young man from Myanmar leaving the toilet block looking to be in pain after entering with an older detainee, and was told by a supervisor, because these transferees were Muslim and actively engaging in prayer that any sexual activity would have been consensual. Abuse inside the camp keeps queer refugees in fear even of one another, said a 24-year-old from Tehran who asked to be identified only as Amir. I cant trust anyone, said Amir, who BuzzFeed News reached with help from an Australian refugee activist and a contraband cell phone guards confiscate cell phones discovered in the camp. Amir interrupted the conversation several times whenever someone else came within earshot. Amir said he fled Iran in May 2013 after his boyfriends father reported him to the police, but he hasnt told anyone in the camp the truth of his case and he largely avoids others he suspects are gay in fear of being targeted. I told everyone I had a problem with my girlfriend [back home] so that no one would realize, he said. If others found out, Theyd harass me, make fun of me, you know we still have this Iranian culture in the camp, he said. Weve had some cases of people whove been raped. View this image  There is not a minute that I do not think about ending this life, Mohsen said. Mohsen  Mohsen spent many months after his arrival on a hunger strike, part of a protest movement that built as the camp grew increasingly crowded throughout 2013. Some of the refugees Amir knew had sewn their lips shut in protest. According to the Australian Senate report, the protests reached a boiling point in February 2014, after immigration officials told a group of protest leaders that they would never be settled in Australia and that if they wished to settle in a third country, they would receive no support from Australia or [Papua New Guinea] to do this, according to an account of the event by Amnesty International. The protests ignited long-simmering hostility from the local community, who felt they had not gotten the economic benefits promised from having the camp on their island. When Papua New Guinea police rushed in to shut down protests on Feb. 17, they were backed by a mob of locals whod been stockpiling weapons outside the compound. By the time peace was restored on Feb. 18, an Iranian named Reza Barati was dead, allegedly from having been beaten. Amir said a Papua New Guinea officer entered his room and beat him with a baton though he was hiding from the violence. Mohsen said he was hit in the head with a rock and knocked unconscious. Australia has made some changes since the riot, including finishing the transfer of control over the camp to a new contractor. But it has also made the camp even more secretive, including adopting the law that could jail employees working on the island for disclosing conditions there. The despair is so great on both islands that detainees are attempting suicide or harming themselves in other ways at a rate that the Sydney Morning Herald reported was reaching epidemic levels. View this image  Facilities at the Manus Island Regional Processing Facility. Handout / Getty Images The riots have also left the prospect of settling in Papua New Guinea even more terrifying to the asylum seekers, especially since the government has made it nearly impossible for them to settle in another part of the country. More than 100 asylum seekers in the detention center have had their refugee petitions accepted and now have the right to move to a more comfortable and open facility outside the islands main town called the transit center, but they are refusing to relocate. Around 300 asylum seekers have decided to go back to the countries they fled, including a Syrian who was tortured by police for 20 days after he returned last year and was later injured in shelling that killed his father. Mohsen has lived in the transit center since last spring, but he said hes attempted suicide twice in the months since. Almost all the other queer refugees are still inside the detention center, in part out of fear of the countrys sodomy law. That fear is so great that at least one asylum seeker reportedly refused to report two incidents of rape because he worried the Papua New Guinea police would throw him in jail. Amir doesnt want to take the chance of living on the outside but unless Australia changes its policies, his only other choice is to go back to Iran. I cannot take the risk of living somewhere even worse than here, where those people who wanted to kill us who killed Reza Barati live, he said. If I had left for any reason other [than being gay], Id go back the next day. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Janet Rice thanked the principal for taking an important stand. View this image  Stefan Postles / Getty Images View this image  Jeff J Mitchell / Getty Images The Safe Schools Coalition (SSC) is an anti-bullying program focusing on LGBTI students with almost 500 member schools across Australia. The Victorian Labor government has pledged to introduce the program in every school by 2018. It was announced in science class that boys could wear school dresses next year. Theyre telling my children to call transgender children by their requested pronoun, White told The Herald Sun. What is the benefit to my son? Hes got a learning disability, hes struggling with his times tables, he doesnt need to deal with this. White added that she didnt want her daughter to share a bathroom with transgender girls. It could be a year 12 student of the opposite-born sex in the bathroom with my year 7 daughter who is blind, she said. View this image  Samuel Kubani / AFP / Getty Images Every single young person Ive met whove been involved in SSC programs have absolutely loved it. Not only has it worked in making LGBTI young people safer, happier and healthier, its brought countless allies to in to our community, Rice wrote. Rice also took aim at the Australian Christian Lobby, which has has long campaigned against the government-funded SSC, saying it teaches radical sexual experimentation and ought to be defunded. She rejected the implication that the program undermines parental authority, Im sure youll agree that the program in no way undermines parents authority. When I sent my two sons to school, I did so in full knowledge that they would be taught things I wasnt qualified to teach them. If I hadnt, they wouldnt have learnt more than the basics of history, biology or PE. This is no different. Dear Mr Albiston, Im writing to congratulate you and the Franskton High School community for showing the courage to stand against the discrimination of LGBTI students and their families. As you are aware, the Safe School Coalition (SSC) provides a vital service for same sex attracted, intersex and gender diverse students, as well as teachers, families and other students. It aims to enable a school environment where students feel safe, happy and healthy and to be treated with dignity and respect. We know that about 1 in 10 people identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex or queer. We know that high school is a critical time for these people as they make the decision to come out. And we know that because of this, the suicide rate of LGBTI young people is around six times higher than the general population. So when I see fabrications from an outdated lobby group undoing some of the good work you and the SSC have done, I have to call these people out. Im sure youll agree that the program in no way undermines parents authority. When I sent my two sons to school, I did so in full knowledge that they would be taught things I wasnt qualified to teach them. If I hadnt, they wouldnt have learnt more than the basics of history, biology or PE. This is no different. They also suggest that this is something other than an anti-bullying program and that most parents would be very concerned about it. But there is zero evidence of that about the program, and all you have to do is to talk to some of the students at your school to know its value. Every single young person Ive met whove been involved in SSC programs have absolutely loved it. Not only has it worked in making LGBTI young people safer, happier and healthier, its brought countless allies to in to our community. I commend you for your work with the SSC. The Greens share your vision for a society where LGBTI young people and their families arent faced by the discrimination shown in these outdated remarks. Until then, we will do everything we can to support your efforts to stamp it out. Thank you, Janet Rice Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Kayden Clarke gained national attention last year for a video he posted of his dog calming him during a meltdown. Police said he lunged at them with a knife. View this image  Kayden Clarke. Kayden Clarke / Via youtube.com After a 24-year-old transgender man was shot and killed in Arizona by police officers, a task force comprised of 12 LGBT and mental health groups have publicly condemned the police, as well as the medical workers they believe failed the man. Officers responded to the Mesa home of Kayden Clarke on Thursday after Clarke had threatened to commit suicide. When Clarke allegedly lunged at officers with a large knife, the police shot and killed him. They told [Clarke] to drop the knife at that point, and [Clarke] lunged extending the knife, Det. Esteban Flores of the Mesa Police Department said during a press conference. Officials said it was only after the deadly shooting they learned Clarke had Aspergers Syndrome. Clarke was identified by police using his birth name and sex. Police departments and other public health and safety workers must be trained to understand that people experiencing mental health crises are typically not threats to others and should be treated with care instead of violence, the letter from the task force which includes the ACLU of Arizona, the National LGBTQ Task Force, and the Autistic Self Advocacy Network - reads. Prior to Clarkes transition, the 24-year-old gained national attention last year after posting a video on YouTube that depicted Clarkes struggles with Aspergers and the loving assistance Clarke received from a service dog. In the viral video, Clarke is seen crying until the dog, Samson, comforts Clarke through the meltdown. Clarke told BuzzFeed News in 2015 the video was posted to raise awareness about Clarkes experiences with Aspergers. youtube.com Clarke continued to post videos discussing the struggles with the disorder, and also began gender therapy to begin a gender transition. In December, Clarke posted a video called Fantastic news! where Clarke told viewers an insurance company would cover the cost of a gender reassignment surgery. But four weeks before the fatal police shooting, Clarke posted a video that called Arizona the worst mental health system across the United States. Ive never met a bunch of mental health professionals who are completely fucking morons, Clarke said. In the video, Clarke explained frustrations after going from one mental health professional to another, and finding someone who could address both Clarkes Aspergers and gender therapy. Nobody seems to know what the fuck Aspergers is, and its frustrating, Clarke said in the video. If anyone in Arizona is listening, please guide me. Clarke said a therapist did not seem prepared to deal with Aspergers, and had allegedly told Clarke medical workers would need to fix your Aspergers before Clarke could begin receiving testosterone for a gender transition. Its not an illness, you cant get better, Clarke said about Aspergers Syndrome. Clarke had also struggled for years with depression, but said it was due to struggles with gender identity. All that depression since first grade has stemmed from trying to transition, Clarke said. Im struggling in my life. They know this. youtube.com The task forces letter also referred to these videos, emphasizing the importance of health care providers being educated on transition-related health care, especially for those on the autism spectrum or with other disabilities. We cannot ignore the possibility that this failure to provide adequate care placed Kayden at heightened risk of experiencing a mental health crisis such as the one that gave rise to the call to the police who killed him, the letter read. Mesa Police Det. Esteban said officers did not have any information about Clarkes mental health issues. When officers first arrive, they dont know what they have, he said. The District Attorneys office is expected to investigate the police shooting. The two officers, who have not been identified, were placed on administrative leave. These tragedies are sadly all too common and demonstrate the need for serious policy change, the letter stated in conclusion. We owe it to Kayden, and to all transgender people and people experiencing mental health crises, to stop these preventable deaths. 2.

aS"We will not allow the misguided and the intolerant to punish LGBT young people for simply being who they are, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. View this image  Yana Paskova / Getty Images New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Saturday announced new executive orders aimed at banning the controversial practice of so-called conversion therapy, which seeks to change peoples gender identity and sexual orientation. The measures announced by Cuomo include bans on public and private health care insurers from providing reimbursement for conversion therapy for people under 18. Additionally, no mental health facility licensed, funded, or operated by the state will be allowed to provide such therapy to minors. Conversion therapy is a hateful and fundamentally flawed practice that is counter to everything this state stands for, Cuomo said in a statement. We will not allow the misguided and the intolerant to punish LGBT young people for simply being who they are. Conversion therapy has been criticized as harmful by many of the countrys top health bodies, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association. A federal report released in October declared that such therapies are coercive, can be harmful, and should not be part of behavioral health treatment. Being lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender is not a disease, disorder, illness, deficiency, or shortcoming, Dr. Warren Seigel, chair of the New York State Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement supporting Cuomos decision. In a press release, the LGBT advocacy group Empire State Pride Agenda said Cuomos announcement was a victory. No longer will unscrupulous peddlers of this dangerous pseudoscience victimize LGBT youth in New York State, the group said. LGBT youth will no longer be driven to suicide by abusive techniques intended to destroy their very identities. In a statement, Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin praised Cuomo as one of the LGBT communitys strongest allies. In April, the White House indicated it supported a federal ban on conversion therapy. Other states that have banned conversion therapy practices include Illinois, California, Oregon, and New Jersey, as well as Washington, D.C. 3.

aS"Activists and officials worry that the bills, which would ban transgender people from public restrooms that correspond with their gender identity, are part of a strategy to pass similar legislation at the ballot this fall. View this image  Rep. Laurie Jinkins AP / Elaine Thompson Similar to legislation across the U.S., six anti-transgender bills filed in the Washington State Legislature this year have alarmed LGBT activists who worry the state could roll back parts of a law banning discrimination. Officials in Olympia, however, told BuzzFeed News that none of the Republican-backed bills has a realistic shot at passing. Leaders of the Democratically controlled House intend to block the bills from getting a hearing or committee vote. And Gov. Jay Inslee, who could veto the bills, is openly hostile to the legislation. Instead, LGBT activists and Democrats worry the volley of bills may foreshadow plans from conservative groups to run a ballot measure this fall to repeal parts of the states 2006 anti-discrimintion law. That tactic would build on a growing, and effective, effort around the country by conservatives to block or repeal LGBT rights by raising concerns about transgender people acting as sexual predators in public restrooms. Such debates are brewing over local ordinances from Alaska to Florida, and it was a central argument to repeal a nondiscrimination law last fall in Houston, Texas. I think people are really worried, and theyre right to be worried, Rep. Laurie Jinkins told BuzzFeed News, saying her office has been deluged with hundreds of phone calls. Even if people are confident that we will not pass these bills this year which I am confident of we have to be aware that they could be harbingers of what is coming across the county, she added. A Human Rights Campaign report identified legislation in 12 other states targeting transgender people. All six of the measures in Washington State House Bills 2589, 2782, 2935, 2941 and Senate Bills 6443 and 6548 would essentially limit single-sex facilities to people of a corresponding birth gender. In doing so, they would undo part of a state law that bans discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation. Backers of the bills, however, say they are responding to new regulations. The states human rights commission issued rules in December clarifying that the 2006 law allows people to use restrooms consistent with their gender identity. Conservatives mounted a backlash, making a familiar case that the rules allow men to sexually prey in womens restrooms. The Family Policy Institute of Washington, a leading advocate to pass the bills, called the human rights commission rules a dangerous policy. They also claimed children and business owners were targets of a leftist plot to give an excruciatingly small segment of the population a little bit more comfort. Most immediately in Washington State, if two senate bills that recently passed in a committee manage to win in the full GOP-controled senate, they will hit a roadblock once they reach Jinkins. Chair of the House Judiciary Committee, the Democrat said she wont let those bills or the four similar bills filed in the house reach the governors desk. I am 100% certain they would come to my judiciary committee, she told BuzzFeed News. I am not going to hear the bills. House Speaker Frank Chopp, the most powerful lawmaker in that chamber, added in a statement to BuzzFeed News, We support the chairs decision to hold those House bills in committee. The 2006 law already allows transgender people to use restrooms consistent with their gender identity, and no known incidents of misconduct have resulted from the law. In addition, the 16 states and 200 cities with similar nondiscrimination laws on the books have no known incidences of the laws being used for nefarious purposes. Joseph Backholm, executive director of the Family Policy Institute of Washington, was the chairman of a 2012 campaign that unsuccessfully tried to repeal the states marriage equality law in a ballot measure. He did not respond to a request to comment on whether his group intended to run a ballot measure relating to gender and bathroom use. But Jinkins said proponents of the anti-transgender bills have made every indication they are going to file an initiative. So I dont want to say, Keep calm and carry on. We dont want to wake up in July and see that they have made the ballot, she said. The Pacific Northwest Inlander reported earlier this week that Sen. Michael Baumgartner, a Republican who supporting one of the bathroom bills, threatened a statewide initiative. Danni Askini, executive director of the transgender advocacy group Gender Justice League, has been pressing lawmakers to block the bills. And while they look fated for demise, she told BuzzFeed News, she thinks they are being used in an election year to stir up the conservative base of voters using misinformation and fear. Jaime Smith, a spokeswoman for governor, also told BuzzFeed News that the bills are extremely unlikely to pass. Smith said the the Democratic governor has made his position pretty clear on the issue. These proposals very much run contrary to our values as a state that embraces diversity and inclusiveness, Smith said. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Prompted by the Bulmer-Rizzi tragedy last month, the senate debated recognising overseas same-sex marriages. View this image  Marty Melville / AFP / Getty Images The 2014 Greens bill, brought forward for debate in the Senate on Thursday morning, would remove the part prohibiting the recognition of overseas same-sex marriages in the Australian Marriage Act, and recognise the marriages under Australian law. The current patchwork state laws were brought to international prominence in January after the tragic death of David Bulmer-Rizzi, on honeymoon in South Australia with husband Marco. As overseas same-sex marriages are not recognised in SA, Davids death certificate was initially marked never married, and Marco was bypassed for Davids father on decisions surrounding the death of his husband. View this image  parlview.aph.gov.au If we start making changes against our sovereign law in the interests of one group then why not the other groups? he said. If were going to be consistent then we need to start recognising things like child marriage, which I think clearly Australians would reject. Senator Cory Bernardi also warned that the door would be opened to polygamy. In some countries, you can go to Saudi Arabia or some of the Islamic countries where its legal for a man to marry four wives. That is a legal marriage. Should we recognise that in this country? he asked the parliament. View this image  Stefan Postles / Getty Images I was married in 1986. In fact, my wife Penny and I will celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary next month, she said. When they got married, it was totally non-controversial, Rice said. But after Penny came out as transgender, society saw their marriage differently. She is now Penny. She was Peter in 1986. We were the same two people. We still loved each other. But suddenly our marriage was not considered the same as it was for the past 16 years, she said. In most Australian states, transgender people must get divorced before they can change the sex on their birth certificate. Shes not going to do that, because we want to stay married, added Rice. View this image  AAP No-one should ever have to go through the trauma experienced by Marco Bulmer-Rizzi after his husband Davids death last month. After Marco Bulmer-Rizzis story received international attention, South Australian premier Jay Weatherill apologised and promised reform to recognise overseas marriages would be introduced by the end of the year.

Watts went on to criticise the government policy of having a plebiscite on same-sex marriage, saying the photoshopped noose image was an example of a taxpayer-funded campaign against marriage reform.

aS"After the school board in Clovis, California, rejected proposed changes to its schools dress code, students took matters into their own hands. Twitter: @MariahCOfficial Twitter: @MariahCOfficial CUSD dress code won't change. The school board voted 4-3 to keep it the way it is. @ABC30 The current dress code policy, set in 1975 and applying to all schools in the district, states that male haircuts may not fall below the mid-point of a standard stand up shirt collar and earlobes must be visible. It also states that earrings are not appropriate or acceptable for male students. Changes to the dress code were proposed last summer after Buchanan High student William Pleasant stated in a published open letter that hed been prevented from enrolling for his senior year due to his long hair. I want to know why girls can have short or long hair but men are forced to have short hair, Pleasant wrote. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, the schools policy violates California law, under which gender expression is a protected category. We were shocked that they decided not to comply with the law. At this point, we havent ruled out any potential strategies including a lawsuit, and we are currently evaluating our next steps, ACLU attorney Abr Conner said in a statement. hey look its the new CUSD dress code! What hurts your district's image more: a kid with piercings or a board who doesn't believe gender equality is a valid idea to be considered CHANGE THE CUSD DRESS CODE. It would mean so much if you could spread this around. https://t.co/CVjoJwNOUT via @gsanetwork An online student petition asking the board to approve a gender-neutral dress code has nearly 2,745 signatures at this time. Rei Bioco, a junior at Buchanan, started the petition after she saw students from several high schools speaking out online. In one day, we gathered one thousand votes, she told BuzzFeed News. While some teachers dress-coded a few of the people in protest, most of our upper administration is supportive of what were doing. She added that the group of students is also planning to present a presentation to the school board to voice their opinions as students in a respectful manner. View this embed  Our districts dress code should not favor or discriminate any gender. We believe everyone should be able to express themselves equally. A boy with long hair is no less of a hard worker than a girl with long hair, she added. Twitter: @kristianbanjo Twitter: @kristianbanjo She added, When we have students that want to do so, we work with them to express their viewpoint without disrupting the rest of the student environment. Fuck the dress code View this image  Sophomore Sophia Brodish, one of the female students who was written up, told BuzzFeed News that although she was forced to change her shirt that day, the students also had an opportunity to communicate with their teachers about the dress issue. On Monday, most of us had meetings with our school faculty and we discussed the events that took place and how we should approach them, she said. We hope to help our school board see and listen to our goal, which is to have a gender-neutral dress code.

Ils sont grave Homophobic pastor's Atlah Worldwide Church in Harlem up for public auction over unpaid debts https://t.co/S6yllK5b2q facebook.com Last Friday, the center began a fundraising drive to buy the property. Carl Siciliano, executive director, told BuzzFeed News on Wednesday the group has already raised $150,000 to buy the building after being encouraged by neighbors. The facility would house 18-20 young LGBT people, making a dent in the waiting list of 200 homeless LGBT youth currently on NYC streets. View this image  Via youtube.com  Ill share this with you, all the sodomites that think you are going to purchase this church in a foreclosure sale, he warned. This is the lords house! This aint no damn bathhouse! It aint no fag house! Manning then got graphic. (Warning: this rant is not for the faint.) Men who are fags with testicles will be carrying babies in their testicles and giving birth to them through their anus, he expounded. Thats how impossible it is for you to get this house. When you start carrying a baby in your bags and birthing that baby through your ass, then you can own this house! But until I see you pull a baby out your ass, you aint gonna pull this church out from underneath us. Boom shaka-laka goes right there! he concluded. And all you fags can go to hell! I joined #SAGEHarlem staff last night in protest of ATLAH Church's #bigotry #LOVENOTHATE w @HarlemUnited @HIVStories The debt in dispute is for a water bill, he said, which he argued the church doesnt owe because churches are exempt from such bills. He said the disputed debt has been smoldering for 16 years, and now, the sodomites have resurrected the issue for a quick land grab. As for his signs, Manning declared, I have spoken only what the Bible says. As for a sign that said, Jesus would stone homos, Manning cited a chapter of the Bible in which Jesus said he would fulfill the law. Asked about a sign that read, many of the homos moving in Harlem looking for some black meat, Manning conceded, Homos moving to Harlem for black meat isnt in the Bible, but people go to bars looking for sex. We can use expressions of cultural reality. View on Instagram Instagram: @dope_access I have been accused of using hate speech, and I dont necessarily think it is, he continued. Just because some people enjoy these lurid, evil sexual practices, they think can force this on the rest of the world. They are trying to smear me, to make me look like an awful person. facebook.com What he his saying in these signs is what they were hearing in their homes, Siciliano said. For them to see the broader LGBT community stand together and stand in opposition, it would be a triumph of love and compassion over the hatred that has shaped so many of their lives. If we get the building, Siciliano said, I would love to have a ceremony that sign has been insulting and inciting hatred and violence for so long, I would love to have people to gather and take the damn thing down.

aS"The medical model is broken. View this image  Open Book Publishers Intersex is an umbrella term for people born with sex characteristics outside of typical understandings of male and female bodies. It is estimated that between 0.5% and 1.7% of the population are born with intersex traits, which can include atypical genitals, gonads and chromosomes. The survey of 272 people, from the University of New England, is the largest survey of intersex people ever conducted in Australia. youtube.com According to Carpenter, medical intervention is too often about fixing bodies to fit typical notions of male and female, rather than focusing on medical need. The medical model is broken, he said. Medical intervention has been about constructing heterosexual men and women who are capable of performing sexually in ways that are seen as appropriate for heterosexual men and women. Alarmingly, the survey found a majority of intersex people who had undergone medical treatment received no information on the option of declining and deferring treatment, while one fifth said they were given no information at all. One participant, known as James, was born with elements of male genitalia and raised as a girl. He underwent two genital surgeries in his youth, but wasnt told that he had male genitalia to begin with or that they were being removed. James was left sterilised by the procedure. I had felt insane because I dreamed I was a boy for so long and it was actually real and I went through it all for no reason, he said. However, Carpenter said, this alarming statistic was paired with a majority of participants rating their mental health as good or better, indicating a high level of resilience in the intersex community. View this image  Jeff J Mitchell / Getty Images The survey suggests this enormous disparity stems from bullying and the impact of medical interventions during puberty. I nearly died of septicemia as a teenager, due to my genital surgery, reported one survey participant. I missed so much school I actually had to drop out entirely. It changed my whole life. Another person reported being bullied by a PE teacher, who accused them of being a drug addict after seeing needle bruise marks from medical treatment. The lack of any discussion of human diversity in sex education, in biology, in other parts of the curriculum has a negative impact on people, Carpenter said. There are consequences for the rest of peoples lives with unemployment. Poverty is also a stressor on the intersex community, with 63% of participants earning a yearly salary of under $41,000, and 41% earning less that $20,000. The survey found that peer support is crucial for the intersex community. Meeting happy, healthy intersex people online caused a complete and radical shift in my thinking and wellbeing, wrote one person. Carpenter also pointed to the diversity of intersex people when it comes to sexuality, with almost half of respondents identifying as heterosexual, 22% as bisexual, 18% as lesbian or gay, and other labels including queer, asexual and no label. Over a third selected multiple labels. We are so diverse, and its wonderful to see that in print, he said. It really does show what we have in common. We dont share a common sex classification, we dont share a common gender identity. But we do share a common experience of stigma and discrimination. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

It can either be taken after unsafe sex for a month, in conjunction with another anti-HIV drug (Raltegravir), or on its own regularly before risky sex, as a pre-emptive measure. Currently, the NHS only allows clinicians to prescribe Truvada following unsafe sex an intervention known as post-exposure prophylaxis (or PEP). They are barred from giving Truvada to patients who wish to take it before unsafe sex an approach called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. (Daily adherence to PrEP can reduce the chance of acquiring HIV by 99%.) But amid mounting pressure in Britain for Truvada to be prescribed on its own as PrEP and four years after it became available in the US a number of gay men concerned that they are at risk of infection are circumventing NHS policy, according to those involved. Greg Owen, a leading activist in the campaign to make PrEP available on the NHS, told BuzzFeed News: Its very hard to ascertain how many people are doing this but Im speaking regularly to people whove been clinic hopping for the last two years. View this image  iwantprepnow.co.uk Based on contact with such clinic hoppers, Owen estimates that as many as 2025% of people seeking PEP are in fact using the Truvada as PrEP. But NHS England told BuzzFeed News that although clinics were aware of the practice there are no official figures, as patients necessarily do not tell clinicians what they are doing. Owen, who last October set up a website offering information for people seeking PrEP, explained how clinic hopping works: You ask for PEP and say you were trashed at the weekend or you think someone came inside you, youre given a weeks worth of pills. You then have to go back for a second appointment where youre given a further three weeks of pills. The problem for the NHS, he said, is that people being prescribed PEP but using it as PrEP only need one of the drugs Truvada and the other drug, Raltegravir, which needs to be taken twice a day, is going to waste. But this isnt the only extra cost for the NHS. As well as two pills out of three being wasted, he continued, if a person goes to a different clinic every month and presents as a new patient theyre given an HIV test every month, whereas if they were on PrEP they would only need one test every three months. Furthermore, for some people who say they have had risky sex in a coercive or intoxicated scenario, other services such as counselling may be offered unnecessarily. Although many might regard clinic hopping as dishonest or a drain on NHS resources, for Owen it illustrates the desperate measures those at risk now feel compelled to take. Though awareness has grown that unbranded, generic versions of Truvada can be bought online, the approximate 45 a month it costs to purchase the drugs is prohibitive to many, he said. Will Nutland, whose doctoral thesis was on PrEP and who also runs an online resource about Truvada, echoed this. He told BuzzFeed News: Clinic hopping is a last resort for people who are trying to look after their health but who dont have the resources or support to buy PrEP privately in the UK or through generic online sales. View this image  prepster.info While some clinic hoppers might go to a different sexual health centre once a month, some go several times in a short period to stockpile Truvada, according to Owen, who said he was in contact with a man who visited 24 clinics in three weeks. He had a couple of weeks off work and was going to Scotland, so he decided to drive up and stop off at as many sexual health clinics and A&E departments as he could, and on the way back down, pick everything [the remaining three-week supplies] up again. So he now has 24 months worth of Truvada for free and 48 months of Raltegravir, which will be wasted. (Even if such drugs were returned in their unused, sealed packages NHS policy prohibits doctors from re-prescribing them.) Another clinic hopper, Stephan Bee, 31, told BuzzFeed News why he felt compelled to do it. Clinic hopping was something I did last year after being on PEP two or three times in 2014, he said. I started researching and figured I could just go and get PEP and use the Truvada. Im from Shropshire so I would get it from the hospital there and from the 56 Dean Street clinic [a London sexual health centre]. So it involved going from place to place and saying Ive had an accident [unsafe sex]. Although trying to remain HIV-negative, which in the long run would cost the NHS significantly less, Bee was uncomfortable about what he was doing. View this image  Stephan Bee Stephan Bee I felt like I was lying and it wasnt good for the NHS. I even emailed an HIV consultant and said I felt I needed the extra protection of PrEP because sometimes I make mistakes and asked, Do you think its wrong that I do this? And she said, No, if thats what you need to do. However, an NHS England spokesman rebutted any suggestion that doctors were complicit in their patients clinic hopping. There are strict guidelines in this area and clinicians take seriously their responsibility to ensure that prescriptions are dispensed only to those who are at high risk of developing HIV. He added that there is no evidence of widespread gaming of this system, but clinicians will continue to be mindful and we would expect any instances which are brought to light to be investigated by the relevant clinic. After gaining a five-month supply of Truvada by claiming PEP from different clinics, Bee said he stopped clinic hopping. I felt guilty knowing how much struggle the NHS is under, but I have two friends that would go to Dean Street [clinic] every month and say they needed PEP. For the last six months Bee has been buying a generic version of Truvada online instead, despite his concerns about whether they were counterfeit. I was anxious at first but I did a lot of research and when I started taking it there was no difference and I still got the vivid dreams [a known side effect of Truvada] that I got from the real Truvada, said Bee. View this image  56 Dean Street Matthew Tucker / BuzzFeed Last week a fourth London sexual health clinic announced it would offer monitoring services (such as kidney function tests and blood tests to check the drugs were working) for people buying PrEP online, and last month a study in The Lancet estimated that if PrEP was made available on the NHS to just a quarter of at-risk men it could prevent over 7,000 new infections by 2020. For many, however, PrEP, whether obtained online or by clinic hopping, has come too late. I was going to start clinic hopping, admitted Greg Owen, and then one of my friends whos HIV-positive said, Oh Ive just changed my meds [antiretroviral medication] and Ive got two months of Truvada here, so do you want to save yourself two months of clinic hopping and come and pick it up? Owen agreed, but knew there was something he had to do before taking the pills. The next day I went for a blood test and I was already HIV-positive.

aS"The Australian actor spoke to BuzzFeed News about being back in Australia, her time on OITNB, and what shes doing to help women newly released from prison. When shes not portraying inmate Lorna Morello on the Netflix prison drama Orange Is The New Black, Yael Stone chips away at the trauma caused by incarceration in an unexpected way. Im not a lawyer, which is probably what would be most useful, she says frankly. But something I can offer is yoga. Stone volunteers with Liberation Prison Yoga, a year-old organisation based in New York City, where the Australian actor has lived since 2011. LPY trains instructors in dealing with trauma, and then sends them into prisons to teach yoga and meditation. After growing exposure to mass incarceration due to her role in OITNB, Stone wanted to somehow help combat the ill physical and mental health that so often accompanies imprisonment. Yoga, which she already taught at a New York studio, seemed like a good fit. Due to an unpredictable filming schedule, Stone doesnt go into penitentiaries to teach like other LPY instructors. But she has undergone the trauma training, and runs a regular class in a New York City shelter for women who have been released from prison. It plays into Stones altruistic mindset. This is where my politics essentially lie, she says, widening her hands into the universal sign for welcome. Everyone come. View this image  Stone plays Lorna Morello in Orange Is The New Black. Netflix Stone, 30, was one of several little-known actors thrust into the spotlight after OITNB became a global sensation. Based on the real-life memoir of Piper Kerman, the show documents the goings-on of fictional womens prison Litchfield Penitentiary. Stone plays inmate Lorna Morello, a loveable romantic with a disturbing backstory and an unforgettable Boston-come-Brooklyn accent that is about as far from a broad Australian twang as you can get. But despite the distance she keeps from Australia while in character, Stone is happy to be back in her home country, at least for a few months. Theres just things in Australia that you cant get elsewhere, she says. Like this place, which has a kind of home feeling for me. Were sitting at a slightly wonky fold-out table in an upstairs room at Belvoir St Theatres Surry Hills rehearsal studio. The floor is bare, with items of questionable dramatic significance scattered around the perimeter a guitar, a cupboard, an abandoned cardboard box. Stone is here for a play at Belvoir called The Blind Giant Is Dancing, which follows a Labor political idealist embroiled in a party power struggle in NSW in the early 80s. Her husband, Dan Spielman, plays the starring role. Stone is, consequently, bashful about doing media. I feel so embarrassed to be doing interviews for this show, because Dan is clearly the lead character, she says. I dont want to imply that Im the lead role, because Im not. Brett Boardman Brett Boardman Stone in rehearsals for The Blind Giant Is Dancing. You might think a non-starring role at Belvoir is small potatoes compared to the glitzy red-carpets and famous friends of the New York based OITNB but Stone makes no such distinction. She speaks about the play with unbridled enthusiasm, her hands gesticulating wildly as she passionately talks about the central theme: the corrupting nature of power. Mostly, Stone says, Stephen Sewells The Blind Giant Is Dancing reminds her of a time when young people were less ready to just accept capitalism as the governing system. In fact, she was so struck by the political idealism in the dialogue that she rang former Belvoir artistic director Neil Armfield, who had previously directed the play, and asked if the way they spoke was for real. The characters sound so deeply naive. But it really wasnt that long ago, she says. Theyre still talking about the possibility of change, and a shift in the way we live, and for me, the first time I read it, was almost a kind of shock, disbelief at how much weve changed. Stone is wistful for that time, when more young people questioned the stable groove of capitalism. Belvoir itself has historically espoused such ideals the building was bought by a collective in 1984, and the company had a parity pay policy as recently as 2010. Thats changed now, but Stone hopes the play will introduce a similar hope naive or otherwise to those who see it. Those ideas really appeal to me, and they always have. But I also live in this world, she says. Its an interesting battle between ideas and reality. Stone tries to chip away at inequality in her own way the yoga for former inmates, for a start. Shes passionate about the issues faced by incarcerated women, and says that interacting with people who have been through the crazy criminal justice system is a good way to keep grounded and remember female prisoners are real people, with real lives. Hearing former inmates tell her they like the show is the best feedback possible. View on Instagram Instagram: @yaelstone One particular woman Im thinking of she was released two years ago now, and the stories that shes told me, it feels very accurate, Stone says. Other than letting her know whether the show is getting it right, Stones yoga pupils have raised her awareness of the devastating cycles of disadvantage that accompany mass incarceration. Its often a traumatic beginning that will create a certain pathway towards being forced into making some pretty bad decisions, that leads to much greater trauma and being sent to prison, Stone explains. A lot of these people are mothers, theyre carers. Once you pull a family apart, the ricochets keep going. You think, Whats going to happen to their kids? she says. OITNB does seem to cover that. And [The Blind Giant Is Dancing] as well. Theyre all about shaking up those expected paradigms. OITNB is certainly shaking up the television industry. Part of its smash success is undoubtedly the representation it offers to women women of colour, queer women, women from disadvantaged backgrounds. Its a show where women are overrepresented, says Stone and she loves that about it, describing shows that are culturally monotonous as a dramatic waste of time. View this image  Foxtel / PR IMAGE How boring to write a show that only represents one kind of people, she says. Were missing out on this whole feast of life, excluding people from storytelling. Lets tell their stories, and theyll want to watch. Although the actors werent cognisant of just how big the show would be you can never know, thats the magic factor there was a unique vibe from the minute they stepped on set. Perhaps some of it comes down to the exceptional casting. They found this collection of people who have kind of gone through the mill a bit. Been pushed around a bit, Stone says. Laverne Cox, who plays inmate Sophia Burset, has become a transgender icon since the show went to air, inspiring thousands of trans and gender diverse people around the world. Amidst ongoing debate over whether cisgender actors should play transgender characters, Coxs depiction of Burset is often held up as an example of how to do representation right. View this image  Stone with OITNBs Lea De Laria and Natasha Lyonne . Jamie Mccarthy / Getty Images Natasha Lyonne, who plays heroin addict Nicky Nichols, has spoken previously about how her own abuse of drugs helped her tap into depicting Nichols correctly. Im far enough removed to not go nuts playing it, but close enough that I have a firm fucking memory of what it takes for a person to end up being somebody who wants to get high at the very real risk of death not somebody who wants to get high and watch a movie, but wants to hit that other level of utter obliteration of all emotion, Lyonne told BuzzFeed last year. Theres some quality which has meant that these people are, without exception, compassionate, interesting, kind, says Stone. They actually care. The cast are famously good friends, too constantly sharing pictures on social media that document their escapades on and off set. Stone describes the show as a gift to her, both personally and professionally. But like all jobs, it has its downsides: the prison cafeteria scenes a staple of the show can take up to 16 hours to shoot. View this image  Netflix Its kind of fun for the first ten hours, but then youre like, Oh my god, Im actually going insane, says Stone. Theres 200 extras, 17 people in a scene at four different tables. You think Im never going to leave. Shooting is a little bit like summer camp, she adds. But then you cross a line, and its total mania. Summer camp on acid. The highly anticipated season four finished filming in November, and drops on Netflix on June 17, 2016. Stone cant give anything away she hasnt had a press briefing yet but she briefly dwells on the emotion that accompanies a season wrap. I have this little thing where I think Oh, well come back. We always come back! But you have to remember, you dont know how long these things last for. Theres no indication the show will stop being commissioned anytime soon. But like any other fan watching the credits roll at the close of a heart-wrenching season, Stone doesnt even like to entertain the notion. I dont want to indulge the idea that one day it will be the end, she says. But its a fucking good trip, while it happens. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .

aS"Many lawmakers were trying to repair the states reputation after passing a religious freedom bill in 2015. But critics condemned a nondiscrimination bill introduced this year for omitting protections for transgender people and creating exemptions that would allow faith groups to discriminate. View this image  State Sen. Travis Holdman, R-Markle, sponsored SB 344. AP / Michael Conroy A bill to bar discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation was withdrawn from the Indiana Legislature minutes before it reached a key hurdle in the Republican-controlled senate on Tuesday, rendering the bill dead. Indiana is reeling from the bad publicity of a religious freedom law passed in 2015, and the bill was widely seen as a means repair the states reputation as hostile to LGBT people. It has has become clear the bill lacks the support to advance in the senate any further, State Sen. Travis Holdman said in a floor speech. As a result, I will not be calling for a vote. I am greatly greatly disappointed, he added, blaming the bills demise on deadlock between factions of lawmakers, the LGBT movement, and far right. Watched nationally as a bellwether for LGBT-rights legislation in GOP-led capitals, Senate Bill 344 was nominally intended to expand the rights of lesbians, gays, and bisexuals. But, in a twist, it was opposed primarily by LGBT advocates. Critics said the bills language raised similar problems to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, passed last spring. Although it was modeled on a federal law, Indianas statute had a broader scope, which critics said would allow private businesses to turn away LGBT customers. Facing a national uproar, Gov. Mike Pence called on lawmakers to pass fix bill that stated the law could not be used for discrimination. Despite signing that fix into law, polls have since found some people perceive the state as unwelcoming while business groups contend Indiana has lost millions in convention and tourism revenue. This years bill, critics said, allowed religious social service providers and small businesses to raise a faith-based defense if they turned away gays and lesbians. The bill also lacked any protections for transgender people which LGBT advocates and business interests considered a deal-breaker. But the issue of LGBT rights is hardly dead in Indiana. Senate president pro tempore David Long, the highest ranking Republican in the chamber, said Tuesday, Well come back to have this conversation, just not this year. Advocacy groups had hoped the bill could be favorably amended during a second reading Tuesday was the bills deadline for that second reading. #SB344 was a deeply flawed bill& we were working to fix it. But doing absolutely nothing? That's not a solution to a very real problem. But a clash over how to proceed paralyzed the Indiana senate early Tuesday afternoon, with lawmakers delaying a session while both parties caucused, sources told BuzzFeed News. Some Republicans who control the senate by a four-to-one margin opposed expanding rights on the basis of sexual orientation entirely, requiring support from Democrats to pass the bill. But many Democrats were reluctant to support the bill due to its many exemptions particularly omitting protections for transgender people. Sources in the capitol said that the parties could not cobble together a majority needed to approve the measure on the senate floor. The collapse of Indianas LGBT rights legislation which was initially thought to have momentum reflects the broader challenge with the entire LGBT movement after winning a marriage victory at the Supreme Court last June. Most states that lack LGBT nondiscrimination protections are controlled by Republican lawmakers, who face vociferous pressure from their evangelical base to oppose any LGBT rights law. However, business chambers, another traditional part of the GOP base, and progressives have teamed up to approve nondiscrimination protections. Peter Hanscom, initiative director of Indiana Competes, a coalition of more than 300 businesses, said in a statement said it was a flawed bill, but it generated the most substantive conversation Indiana has seen regarding anti-discrimination legislation for the LGBT community. In the case of Indiana, lawmakers essentially tried to split the baby by writing religious-freedom rights and LGBT rights into the same bill creating legislation that was ultimately unviable. This is an absultely awful bill, Camilla B. Taylor, counsel for Lambda Legal, told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday morning before the announcement. There is no way this can be interpreted as helping LGBT people rather than hurting them. Likewise, Human Rights Campaign legal director Sarah Warbelow had said, The bill in this form is completely unacceptable. Other bills concerning LGBT rights were also introduced this session in Indiana, but none made it as far, and given the schedule for deadlines, it appeared unlikely any LGBT related legislation could pass in 2016. Sen. Holdman, the sponsor, warned fellow lawmakers in his speech Tuesday afternoon, The underlying issue is not going to go away. I hope that everyone on all sides of the debate can come together and reach a compromise. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The Sundance Film Festival winner As You Are presents a sexually fluid trio of teenage characters. View this image  Amandla Stenberg, Charlie Heaton, and Owen Campbell in As You Are. Courtesy Sundance Institute Miles Joris-Peyrafittes As You Are is set during 1994s grunge apex, but its sexual politics are firmly 2016. Its the story of a trio of sexually fluid teenage friends. Jack (Owen Campbell) is sensitive and introverted, and soon falls for the more charismatic, careless Mark (Charlie Heaton), the son of his mothers new boyfriend (Mary Stuart Masterson and Scott Cohen, respectively). Amandla Stenberg (Rue from The Hunger Games) plays Sarah, Jack and Marks rational, but slightly worshipful friend, whose low-key romantic affections seem equally directed toward both boys. View this image  Miles Joris-Peyrafitte accepting the U.S. Dramatic Special Jury Award at the Sundance Film Festival Awards Ceremony on Jan. 30. Andrew Toth / Getty Images Joris-Peyrafitte, who is 23 years old, directed As You Are; co-wrote it with his childhood best friend, Madison Harrison; co-wrote its music with Patrick Higgins; and has a small part in it too. The movie began as Joris-Peyrafittes senior thesis project (with another title As a Friend grabbed from Nirvanas song Come As You Are) at Bard College, from which he graduated in 2014. And after he showed the short to producer Brent Stiefel, it grew into a feature. One on a particularly compressed, stressful timetable for the Sundance Film Festival: Joris-Peyrafitte and Harrison wrote As You Ares screenplay in late fall 2014, the movie finished filming in early October of 2015, and was accepted to Sundance the next month, where it went on to win a special jury award. As You Are, which is seeking distribution, is about thwarted, possibly misplaced, love, irresponsible parenting, and unfortunate access to guns. It all turns out to be a deadly combination: The movie has a crime backdrop, one we learn about through police interrogation scenes featuring all but one of the main characters who then reveal what happened in flashback. Despite the same-sex love story that in part drives its action, As You Are threads what may be an increasingly meaningful distinction between a gay/LGBT movie and a queer one. I dont think of the characters as being straight or gay or anything like that, Joris-Peyrafitte said during an interview in Park City, Utah, the day after As You Are premiered to strong reviews. I think what we wanted to do is present these characters free of judgment, and to present their circumstances free of judgment. Campbell, whose Jack typifies the adolescent yearning that can go horribly awry if its squelched or, worse, vilified, echoed Joris-Peyrafittes characterization of the films (lack of) identity politics. There are people who identify as gay, and thats a different thing than these kids, Campbell said. They dont identify as anything but each other, and these feelings arent binary for them. View this image  Courtesy Sundance Institute Regardless of the characters feelings, or Joris-Peyrafittes aims, he is aware that As You Ares violent endpoint places it squarely in a legacy of LGBT film history that has often punished its characters. How it fits into the larger conversation about that, I dont really have a great answer for it, Joris-Peyrafitte said. Because its true that theres this weird trope that started emerging, and I feel pretty uncomfortable with it. I genuinely dont think that thats what this movie is doing, because a part of where that comes from is judgment, and a part of where that comes from is labeling. And thats the opposite of what we wanted to do. This isnt a story about a kid whos gay who kills someone who isnt. Or a kid whos straight who kills someone whos gay. Or a kid who kills himself. Its about love and friendship and being pushed to a place where you dont know what to do. Joris-Peyrafitte would also prefer not being labeled himself. I wish I could own, and call myself, queer in a way of just not aligning myself in any way, he said. But I also think thats not my right to a certain degree, because Im a man who has relationships with women. And I havent gone through that struggle in a way that people do who come out on the other side. Its not my title to take, and its not my word to claim. During a different time in both American politics and pop culture, Masterson, now 49, who plays Jacks downtrodden mom, starred in 1991s Fried Green Tomatoes, a lesbian love story that unlike As You Are actively hid, rather than complicated, its queer backbone. And looking back on that movie shows how far weve come: According to Masterson, the romantic story between Idgie, whom she played, and Ruth (Mary-Louise Parker) was redacted, and the filmmakers edited out scenes that would have made it entirely clear that they were a couple. We were clearly playing that, Masterson said. But in the final cut, it was just about friendship, she said. I think they might have been afraid. Twenty-two years ago, when As You Are is set, Jack, Mark, and Sarah would have had fewer resources, and certainly almost no role models, to help shape their future selves. They dont really know what theyre doing, Campbell said. Theyre just trying everything to make themselves feel whole, and when the universe keeps stepping in the way of that, they have to try something new. They just keep trying everything until, in the end, they try something with tragic results. Theyre just trying to get out of this crushing environment, which wont allow them to develop. View this image  Stenberg at Sundance. Jason Merritt / Getty Images Stenberg who at 17 is known on the internet as a powerful, political voice said she was drawn to As You Are for its nonjudgmental approach, which she found refreshing. Aside from the tragedy, there are really beautiful parts of the movie that portray love in such a pure way, Stenberg said. And hopefully perpetuates the message that love is not gendered, and sexuality is not gendered either. Earlier this year, Stenberg came out as bisexual in the most modern of ways: on Teen Vogues Snapchat channel. When asked about it, she smiled. Im only smiling because I keep getting asked about it, she said. And its kind of funny to me, because I didnt think of it myself as, like, coming out. I was talking about myself and my identity, and that was a component of a larger thing that I was saying. But of course the way that gets picked up is different. Stenberg certainly understands why that happened that coming out, at least for now, is still an important act, and it continues to be notable when well-known people do it. As a teenager in 2016, she sees both sides. For some people, identifying with a community is really empowering; for other people, they dont want to put a label on themselves, she said. Im honestly kind of stuck in the middle. Sometimes I refer to myself as bisexual, sometimes I dont want to refer to myself as anything. Stenberg, above all, feels that a multiplicity of representation is what gets her excited for a different sort of future. I kind of saw myself in the relationship between Jack and Mark, and them exploring their sexual fluidity. I hope we get to the stage where no one really has to come out, where sexuality isnt assumed, and gender isnt assumed as well, Stenberg said. So there doesnt have to be a somewhat painful process for some people where they have to feel very vulnerable. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .

Sajjad Hussain / AFP / Getty Images The Supreme Court of India gave new hope to LGBT rights supporters on Tuesday, ordering new proceedings that could overturn a 2013 judgement that upheld the countrys colonial-era law criminalizing homosexuality. The decision by the Supreme Court it agreed to hear the petition and referred the case to a five-judge constitutional bench came in a rare hearing on what is known as a curative petition, which allows a panel of judges to reconsider Supreme Court judgements that have already been issued. (Supreme Court cases in India are routinely decided by small panels of the courts judges, not the court as a whole.) The odds may still be against the lawyers arguing the sodomy law should be struck down in this case, which is known as Suresh Kumar Koushal v. Naz Foundation. Curative petitions have only led a ruling to be overturned three times since the process was created in 2002. The 2013 ruling in the Koushal case was a crushing end to a 12-year legal battle that LGBT advocates appeared poised to win. The case was first brought by the Naz Foundation Trust, an HIV organization that had its employees detained by police for more than six weeks under charges including conspiracy to commit sodomy. The group won a sweeping judgement from the Delhi High Court in 2009 that meant the law could not be enforced, and many Indians came out following the decision no longer fearing legal consequences. But the Delhi High Court ruling was reversed by a panel of two Supreme Court judges in 2013, who wrote that the provision does not criminalize a particular people or identity or orientation [but] merely identifies certain acts which if committed would constitute an offense, and therefore did not violate fundamental rights protections in Indias constitution. In the year following the laws reinstatement, the Indian Home Ministry reported nearly 600 people were arrested under the law. There was also widespread fear that it had reopened the door to harassment and blackmail of LGBT people because seeking help from the police could expose them to further danger. A ruling that came a few months after Koushal suggested sharp divisions between Supreme Court judges on the question of LGBT rights, and may have been a factor in Tuesdays decision. In April 2014, a different panel of judges issued a broad ruling establishing protections for transgender people in which they appeared to directly rebuke the Koushal judgment. Discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation or gender identity, therefore, impairs equality before law and equal protection of law, they wrote. 2. 15 Hopeful, Beautiful Reactions To Supreme Courts Homosexuality Ruling buzzfeed.com 3.

aS"Samir Chachoua, who claims to have developed a cure for cancer and AIDS, found a sympathetic audience on Fridays episode of Real Time with Bill Maher. Doctors and scientists arent happy about it. View this image  Frederick M. Brown / Michael Buckner / Getty Images / Via gettyimages.com On Friday night, comedian Bill Maher had a controversial guest on his show: Samir Chachoua, an Australian doctor who practices in Mexico. Earlier this month, Charlie Sheen went on The Dr. Oz Show and described going to Mexico to get Chachouas unproven HIV treatment, injections he developed after studying the milk of goats with arthritis. Doctors and HIV/AIDS experts are shocked that Maher would promote such a dubious medical treatment to his HBO shows audience of 4 million people. I was absolutely flabbergasted, Mark Harrington, executive director of Treatment Action Group, a New York-based HIV advocacy organization, told BuzzFeed News. To promote a quack on his show, its very irresponsible and can only be described as tabloid journalism at its worst. This kind of high profile pumping of alternative medicine stories linked to celebrities can harm other people by persuading them to do damaging things that affect their health, John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, told BuzzFeed News. This is a classic example of false hope syndrome, Moore added. People are persuaded to do wacky stuff that stops them from doing the right stuff. Mahers representative did not respond to a request for comment. Chachoua did not respond to a request for comment, but he posted a long response to Oz and Sheen on his website, in which he stands by his claims. He also alleged there that Sheen initially came to him to make his law suits go away by offering a treatment to people that he may have infected. Sheens manager, Mark Burg, vehemently denies this claim. None of it is true, sad what some people will do to make money, Burg told BuzzFeed News by email. Charlie will respond when he next does the Dr. Oz show on Feb 9. I usually like Bill Maher but he has been totally irresponsible having Samir Chachoua on Real Time promote his HIV cure quackery. Hey @billmaher if #allliesmatter why not check facts before giving quack Chachoua a national audience? Shame on @HBO for destroying their decades long record in AIDS awareness by letting @billmaher claim he found cure On The Dr. Oz Show, Sheen described his radically bizarre experience in Mexico. According to Sheen, he sought Chachouas treatment after becoming frustrated with the side effects from migraines to poo poo pants of conventional antiretroviral drugs. Despite the fact that the meds had kept his HIV at undetectable levels for years, Sheen went to Mexico and received a series of injections from Chachoua. youtube.com At first, the results of these treatments were incredible, Sheen told Oz, leading to undetectable blood levels of HIV. Heres how Sheen described the treatment, which he apparently got with two friends: Two dear friends that you know, they withdrew their blood, I withdrew some of mine, and I added mine to their test tubes. The blood was then incubated and cultured for four days, and when the results came back, all three were undetectable. Sheen said he also watched Chachoua take a sample from Sheens elbow and inject it into his own forearm, to prove how confident he was that the treatment had worked. You can see why I was developing more faith, and more interest, and more intrigue into this, the path this gentleman was potentially taking me down, Sheen said. But just before going on the show, Sheen said, he found out that his HIV levels had gone back up. Oz brought on Sheens longtime doctor, Robert Huizenga of Beverly Hills, and they staged an intervention of sorts, imploring Sheen to go back on his regular medications. Sheen readily agreed. The hype over Sheens adventures in medical tourism could have ended there. But on Friday night, Bill Maher gave a sympathetic interview to Chachoua, asking him for more details about how his unusual treatment came about. Chachoua told Maher that it began a long time ago, when he found a place in Mexico with lots of IV drug users and prostitutes who conspicuously did not have AIDS. What I found was that people there were drinking milk from goats which had arthritis, Chachoua said. These goats have a virus called CAEV. And this virus destroys HIV, and protects people who drink it for life. CAE, or caprine arthritis encephalitis, is a real goat retrovirus, and it is in the same broad viral family as HIV. Some researchers have speculated that it could be used as a substitute for HIV in animal research, and a 2003 study suggested that people exposed to CAE might (falsely) test positive for HIV. Several other animals, including sheep, primates, horses, and cats, also carry HIV-like viruses, and those, too, have been used in research, Moore said. They exist. Now, would one be a vaccine against another? Uh, no. Its not that simple, Moore said. There is no solid research showing that CAE works as an HIV treatment or vaccine. In fact, researchers have been trying to develop an effective HIV vaccine for 30 years. Were not all at home twiddling our thumbs, Moore said. Its not an easy problem, and the solution is not injecting people with viruses or drinking goats milk. youtube.com Maher played a local news clip from years ago claiming that Chachoua had won $10 million in a lawsuit against Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for allegedly suppressing his scientific work. (He had a contract with the institution for storing and testing his vaccines.) Court documents show that in 2000, a federal jury indeed awarded Chachoua $10,111,250 for a breach of a contract. That award was tossed out by a judge, who found that all but $11,250 of the award had been based on speculative testimony. The judges ruling was upheld on appeal. Over many years, Chachoua told Maher, he has been collecting various infections and using them as treatments. He mentioned using certain strains of measles and mumps to fight cancer, for example. Its an incredibly bad idea for anyone else to try to do this, Harrington, of Treatment Action Group, said. Broadcasting it is a danger to people with HIV who may not understand the science. Some 16 million people worldwide are on antiretroviral medications, he added, but another 20 million need to be put on treatment. There are dozens of treatment cocktails available, he added, so if one results in side effects patients can switch to another. 7.

aS"The Log Cabin Republicans accuse Clinton of being wrong on gay rights when it mattered. When asked who on the Republican side they believed was better on gay rights today, the groups leader dodged. View this image  A clip in a new web ad from Log Cabin Republicans shows then-Sen. Hillary Clinton, speaking in defense of marriage between a man and a woman on the Senate floor, in 2004. WASHINGTON With the clock ticking down to Caucus Day in Iowa, the head of an organization of gay Republicans says his group is trying draw attention to the historical larceny taking place in the Clinton campaign when it comes to the former secretary of states record on LGBT rights. Using clips from Hillary Clinton opposing marriage equality during her time in the Senate more than a decade ago, Log Cabin Republicans on Saturday morning launched a web ad accusing Clinton of being wrong on gay rights when it mattered. To add insult to injury, the group counters the three clips it uses of Clinton opposing same-sex couples marriage rights in 2002 and 2004 with one of her key primary opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, talking this past fall about how leadership counts when the going is tough. View this image  Asked about the ad, Log Cabin Republicans President Gregory Angelo told BuzzFeed News via email, Someone needed to point out the revisionist history taking place and it certainly wasnt going to be gay Democrats. Asked who Log Cabin sees as being better than Clinton on gay rights, Angelo dodged, responding, Naming a better Republican candidate for president on gay rights is unrelated to setting the record straight on Hillary Clintons real record on gay rights, which Democrats and the LGBT community seem to be ignoring. Sanders, however, regularly points to Clintons evolution on marriage equality and to his opposition to the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996 legislation signed into law by Clintons husband, President Bill Clinton in his public speeches and in debates and other events. Additionally, its also notable that the group used a clip of Sanders in 2015, because as late as 2006 after the Clinton clips Sanders still had not yet endorsed marriage equality, instead siding with civil unions. At the end of the ad, when identifying Log Cabin Republicans as being behind it, the ad also contains a disclosure noting that predictably the group does not endorse either of the candidates featured in the ad. In fact, Angelo said that his group does not endorse in primaries, presidential or otherwise, adding, We have members across the country who personally support a number of the current GOP candidates for the nations highest office. Although the group did not endorse President George W. Bushs re-election in the 2004 general election due to the presidents support for the Federal Marriage Amendment, the group did endorse John McCain and Mitt Romney over Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, respectively. youtube.com Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Monica Loera is the first known trans person to be killed in 2016, after a surge in trans homicides last year. View this image  Facebook In a statement issued on Tuesday that identified Monica Loera, 43, by her birth name and used masculine pronouns, the Austin Police Department said Loera was shot around 3 a.m. local time on Jan. 22. She was taken to hospital, where she later died. On Wednesday, police said they arrested JonCasey William Rowell, 29, over Loeras death. He was charged with first degree murder and is being held in the Travis county jail on a $250,000 bond, according to prison records. According to his arrest affidavit, Rowell was invited to Loeras home by text message, but he later returned and argued with her about a possible theft, the Austin-American Statesman reported. On Friday, a report in the Austin Chronicle revealed that Loera identified as a trans woman. She was funny, [and] beautiful, a close friend told the Chronicle. I never saw her as David, I saw her as Monica. She loved Madonna and she loved to cook. View this image  Facebook. Loeras death, which was Austins first homicide this year, comes after a spate of trans homicides in 2015, with at least 22 transgender or gender-nonconforming individuals killed. It took only three weeks for the initial quiet of 2016 to be shattered by the murder of another trans person, said Nell Gaither, president of Trans Pride Initiative, in a statement. Nineteen of the victims were individuals of color, according to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, which documented the deaths. It may be a new year, but its looking like, unfortunately were telling the same horrific story, said Beverly Tillery, executive director of the New York City Anti-Violence Project, in an emailed statement to BuzzFeed News. Once again, our community is experiencing the double tragedy of both the homicide of a transgender woman of color and the added insult of police officials and media erasing her real identity from their accounts and reports. As our community continues to mobilize to address this violence, we will not tolerate the misnaming and mis-gendering that further devalues the lives of all transgender women, she said. 3.

aS"Charlene Lauderdale was denied coverage for the procedures by her private insurance firm, which is funded through Medicare. But for the first time this month, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services panel found that the insurance provider must cover the procedures. View this image  Courtesy Charlene Lauderdale A Department of Health and Human Services panel found for the first time that a private insurer that provides coverage through a government-funded Medicare Advantage program must cover a transgender persons sex reassignment surgery. The council finds that the vaginoplasty surgery requested in this case is covered and is the responsibility of the plan, according to the January 21 decision by the Medicare Appeals Council, the top internal review body within the federal agency for Medicare appeals. Ezra Young, an attorney who represented a 55-year-old Texas woman, told BuzzFeed News the decision breaks ground as the first resounding affirmation from a government entity that transition care should be treated like other care. This decision specifically calls for, and identifies, genital surgery as being covered. Young added, This potentially affects all Medicare enrollees and will likely influence private insurers as well. LGBT organizations also lauded the decision Friday as an important step for transgender health care that builds on increasingly accepted medical standards. The precursor to this months decision came in May 2014, when HHS lifted a categorical ban on transition-related coverage; however, the implications of that decision for genital surgery was unclear. Young said that a handful of procedures have been approved in the following years, but no request for genital surgery had reached the HHS appeals council until this case, brought by Charlene Lauderdale. A disabled Air Force veteran, Lauderdale was covered by United Healthcare through Medicare Advantage, a government-run program that compensates private insurers for patients who qualify for subsidized health care. Lauderdale was denied coverage for the procedures in 2014, leading to a series of appeals resulting in this months decision in her favor. She declined an interview Friday. This decision reveals that genital surgery is not a shameful thing to request or to need, and the federal government has their back, said Young, adding that genital surgery is one form of treatment medically necessary for some transgender people. Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, said in a statement to BuzzFeed News, This decision reaffirms that Medicare beneficiaries deserve care based on real medicine, not knee-jerk biases. We hope it sends a clear message that insurance companies need to follow the established standards of care and that patients can fight companies who dont. Other LGBT groups also praised the development. The Human Rights Campaigns legal director, Sarah Warbelow, said in a statement it was a tremendously important step towards helping ensure that transgender people who rely on Medicare are no longer denied access to the basic, yet crucial, medical care they need. She also credited Young for his incredible victory in this case and hoped it would lead to HHS finalizing a regulation of the Affordable Care Act that would instruct all insurance carriers to take similar steps. Jamison Green, president of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), said the decision reflects guidance set by WPATH. This welcome decision is a testament to the dedication of those healthcare providers who have persisted in researching and treating transgender, transsexual, and gender non-conforming people, Green said in a statement.

aS"Department lawyers bypassed the option to seek dismissal of case that claims sexual orientation discrimination is a type of sex discrimination banned by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. View this image  Attorney General Loretta Lynch Nicholas Kamm / AFP / Getty Images WASHINGTON On Thursday, the Justice Department took the first step toward backing the view of a federal commission that sexual orientation is a type of sex discrimination barred under existing civil rights law. In response to a lawsuit filed by a former Federal Aviation Administration employee claiming that he was illegally discriminated against on the basis of his sexual orientation, Justice Department attorneys on Thursday chose to answer his complaint rather than seeking to have it dismissed outright. In his complaint, filed this past October, David Baldwin alleged that he was discriminated against because of his sexual orientation and that such discrimination was illegal because it is a type of sex discrimination barred by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Although such claims used to regularly fail, advocates supported by a growing body of law and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission have pressed in recent years for the claims to be revisited and for courts to find that sexual orientation discrimination should be barred as a type of sex discrimination. The Justice Department made the correct call by defending this case on the facts rather than making the outdated and conservative legal argument that the Civil Rights Act does not protect gays and lesbians from workplace discrimination, Tico Almeida, the civil rights attorney who founded Freedom to Work, told BuzzFeed News. Justice Department lawyers had faced a deadline of Thursday to decide whether to answer Baldwins allegations or file a motion to dismiss them. A motion to dismiss them most likely would have been filed on grounds arguing that Baldwin could not state a claim that the FAA violated Title VII because sexual orientation discrimination is not barred by Title VII. By answering the complaint, the Justice Department bypassed the option of seeking a dismissal on those grounds in other words, an attempt to toss out the case before the back-and-forth of litigation begins. This past July, the EEOC in response to a complaint filed by Baldwin issued a decision in his favor. The EEOC found that allegations of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation necessarily state a claim of discrimination on the basis of sex that are barred by Title VII. From there, Baldwin chose to file suit against the FAA in October. In December, the parties agreed to an extension through Thursday for the Justice Department to respond to the lawsuit. A Justice Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the filing reflected a larger change in the departments view on the issue. The move comes in the midst of a significant and growing effort from advocates, the EEOC, and others to provide federal protections for LGBT people under existing laws, as new legislative efforts have stalled in Congress. The EEOC ruled in 2012 that anti-transgender discrimination is covered by the sex discrimination ban in Title VII. The independent agency was later joined by the Justice Department, which announced its agreement with the position in late 2014. Both have since been urging courts to take that position. On Wednesday, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, heard arguments over the issue of transgender coverage in the context of Title IXs education protections. The Justice Department backed the transgender student, Gavin Grimm, who is suing his school district for alleged sex discrimination. Until Thursday, however, the Obama administration had not made any public signals as to whether it similarly would join the EEOC in advancing the argument that sexual orientation discrimination should be barred under existing law. But the Justice Departments move on Thursday answering the complaint is such a signal. Notably, the move comes a year after the Justice Department had opposed Saks Fifth Avenue for having filed a motion to dismiss in an employment discrimination case brought by a former employee of the department store who is transgender.

aS"We shouldnt try to change something without understanding it. View this image  Dan Kitwood / Getty Images Abbott travelled to the U.S. this week to address the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative lobby group focused on opposing abortion, same-sex marriage and preserving religious freedom. In Abbotts speech, reported by The Australian on Friday, he suggested that same-sex marriage is inextricably linked to the raising of children and the family unit. We shouldnt try to change something without understanding it, without grasping why it is that one man and one woman open to children until just a very few years ago has always been considered the essence of marriage and the heart of family, he said. Policymakers shouldnt be judgmental about peoples personal choices but we cant be indifferent to the erosion of family given its consequences for the wider community.

aS"Religious leaders have been penning letters in opposition to the changes. View this image  The provinces 61 school boards including publicly-funded Catholic schools have until the end of March to create policies based on the guidelines. Three bishops have now publicly stated their opposition to the guidelines, the most scathing of which came from Calgary Bishop Fred Henry. He titled his letter Totalitarianism in Alberta: The Alberta Government Guidelines issued on January 13th show no evidence of consultation with or sensitivity to the Catholic community. They breathe pure secularism. This approach and directive smack of the madness of relativism and the forceful imposition of a particular narrow-minded anti-Catholic ideology. Henry also said gay-straight alliance clubs are highly politicized ideological clubs and the view of sexuality that they espouse is not Catholic. Gerrard Pettipas, the archbishop for Grouard-McLennan in Northern Alberta, also chimed in: The Church teaches, under an authority that is greater than herself, that humans are created in the image and likeness of God male and female he created them. The Church believes that ones physiological gender is not arbitrary, but determines the identity that we grow into. This process of growth in identity must be respected. Conservative media outlets and trustees for Albertas Catholic school boards have also voiced opposition to LGBT accommodations. View this image  A major theme in the guidelines and one detractors have deemed a problem is the right of students to determine their own identity: For the purpose of accommodating the diverse needs of students and staff in a school, an individuals self-identification is the sole measure of their sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression. Emphasis ours. That means it doesnt matter how a student dresses, or what their birth certificate says, or whats in their medical records they can be addressed by the name and gender pronoun that suits them best. The guidelines also recommends to, where possible, checking in with the student before sharing information about their sexual or gender identity with other adults. Essentially, if its unsafe for a student to be out at home, this could protect them from harm. View this image  This can play out in many ways, from making sure dress codes respect everyones gender expressions to making sure gender-neutral washroom and changing rooms are available. It also means making sure gender-diverse students have full access to things like sports and other extra-curricular activities. Key to all this is minimizing how often students are separated by gender, such as for health or gym classes: This increases opportunities to respect studentsfull expression of who they are and allows them to play, learn, dress, present and express themselves in flexible and diverse ways that are congruent with their gender identity or gender expression. View this image  The only way to make this all work is if everyone is on board, so the province is recommending a whole-school approach. That means making sure students have a code of conduct to prevent bullying, policies that protect LGBT staff, and accommodations that extend to parents. The end goal of all this? To make sure everyone feels safe, welcome, and valued at school. You can read the full text of the guidelines here. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"A panel of judges will consider reversing a decision issued in December 2013 that reinstated the countrys colonial-era sodomy law, a source tells BuzzFeed News. View this image  Gayaxaly / Via orinam.net WASHINGTON Indias Supreme Court has scheduled a new hearing in the challenge to the countrys law criminalizing homosexuality, a member of the legal team challenging the law confirmed to BuzzFeed News on Thursday. The lawyer, who declined to comment on the record for this story, said the team had been notified by the courts registrar the hearing was scheduled for Tuesday, Feb. 2. This new hearing is on what is known as a curative petition, a motion to reconsider a Supreme Court judgment that has already been issued. A panel of judges will consider reversing the decision issued in December 2013 that reinstated the countrys colonial-era sodomy law known as Section 377 which had been suspended for four years following a 2009 lower court ruling. This curative petition is the final appeal available to have the 2013 ruling reversed. Nearly 600 people were reportedly arrested under the provision in the year after it came back into effect, according to statistics from Indias Home Ministry, though LGBT activists have been concerned the law would primarily serve as a pretense for police harassment or extortion. Though a previous motion to reverse the 2013 ruling was unsuccessful, LGBT activists were hopeful that a strong ruling supporting transgender rights issued the following year could provide a basis for revisiting the question. The judges in that case did not comment directly on the 2013 ruling, but they wrote, Discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation or gender identity, therefore, impairs equality before law and equal protection of law.

aS"Three judges at the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals considered Gavin Grimms case, asking whether existing federal laws allow transgender students to use restrooms that reflect their gender identity. View this image  BuzzFeed News / Dominic Holden RICHMOND, Virginia A federal appeals court on Wednesday heard oral arguments in the case of a transgender student fighting to use the boys restroom at his high school the highest court in the U.S. legal system to hear such a case amid a national debate over transgender access to restrooms. At the center of the case is Gavin Grimm, a 16-year-old transgender boy who sat in the front row of the gallery, his mothers arm over his shoulder, while a three-judge panel peppered lawyers with questions that ranged from arcane to graphic. The underlying question before the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals is simple: Do existing laws that ban discrimination on the basis of sex specifically, Title IX, which bans the practice in publicly funded schools apply to transgender students? If they do, Grimm could prevail in his lawsuit to overturn a Gloucester County School Board policy that restricts students to restrooms reflecting their biological gender. But to answer that question, judges probed thornier matters about whether sex is solely determined at birth, whether surgeries and hormone treatments can change someones sex, and if evolving understanding about gender redefines decades-old laws on discrimination. Although the three judges did not make clear how they would rule, none appeared interested in dismissing the case outright, as requested by the rural Virginia school board. The panel included two judges appointed by President Obama. The first, Andre M. Davis, seemed most open to the argument that transgender discrimination is banned under existing federal law. The second, Henry Franklin Floyd, was quietest of the group but has sided with LGBT advocates before writing the majority decision in a case holding that Virginias ban on same-sex couples marriages was unconstitutional. The third judge, Paul V. Niemeyer, was the lone dissenting vote in that marriage case. Appointed by George H.W. Bush, Niemeyer appeared most skeptical on Wednesday of arguments from Grimms lawyers and concerned with the ramifications for student privacy in locker rooms. Much of the discussion focused on what constitutes sex-based discrimination given years of evolving court decisions that have broadened the scope of Title IX. This is 2016, Judge Davis said. What is the meaning of sex in 2016? Davis was pressing David Corrigan, a lawyer for the school board, who had argued that sex is strictly determined at birth, and that Title IX allows single-sex facilities like restrooms and locker rooms to be segregated by birth sex alone. Corrigan also argued that cisgender students that is, those who are not transgender are entitled to privacy from students born a different sex, and that lawmakers drafting Title IX never intended for sex to encompass transgender people. But Davis retorted that I thought we were past interpreting sex-based discrimination on such narrow terms. He cited a 1989 Supreme Court decision that found it was illegal for the firm Price Waterhouse to discriminate against a female employee for failing to meet expectations of feminine behavior. If we talk about gender roles, Davis said, we talk about gender identity. That echoed a point made by Grimms lawyers, who said transgender discrimination was based on an individual failing to meet gender expectations, and therefore was sex-based discrimination. The Justice Department filed a brief supporting Grimm that made a similar point, noting that the Department of Education and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission respectively have found Title IX and Title VII, which governs sex discrimination in employment, ban transgender discrimination as a form of sex discrimination. Joshua Block, the ACLU lawyer representing Grimm, said after the hearing that a decision in Grimms favor could be a bellwether that guides future decisions. But Judge Niemeyer raised concern about the slippery slope of allowing gender identity to determine which facilities a student can use, particularly eroding privacy in locker rooms. He pressed Block on whether an anatomical male with the gender identity of a female could use a girls or womens locker room. Block confirmed that gender identity, not birth sex or anatomy, should be the deciding factor. It is a much more exposed environment, Niemeyer said. Indeed, the debate around Grimm has long been about more than him and a restroom its been about policies around the country. In the beginning of the 2014 school year, Grimm used the boys restroom with the principals permission for seven weeks, without complaints from students. But some parents became upset and rallied at school board meetings to ban Grimm, saying that otherwise boys could prey on girls by claiming they were transgender. In December of that year, the school board passed a resolution restricting single-sex facilities to students with a matching biological gender. The policy apparently aimed specifically at Grimm, the only openly transgender student in the district also provided three one-person, gender-neutral restrooms for students who dont want to use their assigned single-sex restrooms. Grimm filed a complaint with the Department of Justice that December and a lawsuit against the school board in June 2015, saying the policy was discriminatory and stigmatizing. He has refused to use the girls restroom, pointing out that he looks and presents as a boy, and that using the single-stall restrooms brand him as an outcast. Last year, however, U.S. District Court Judge Robert Doumar ruled against Grimms request for an injunction which would have allowed him to use the boys restroom while the case goes to trial and tossed out Grimms claim under Title IX. Currently, in his appeal to the 4th Circuit, Grimm is asking the judges to reconsider that Title IX question, impose an injunction, and remand the case to a different judge when it goes to trial. The most immediate matter before the court Wednesday was whether to grant that preliminary injunction. Among other issues, the court debated whether Grimm or the school district would suffer greater harms one of the questions courts face when granting injunctions. What harm was caused in the seven weeks he used the restroom? Judge Floyd asked the school boards lawyer. Corrigan said the policy didnt discriminate because it applied equally to everyone assigned male at birth and female at birth. Again, what was the harm? Floyd pressed again. Corrigan said there had been complaints raised by parents and there were concerns about student privacy in the restroom. But Judge Davis countered that students who want additional privacy could use the single-person restrooms and that dividers in bathrooms prevented unwanted exposure to other students genitals. Davis also argued that the status quo was that Grimm used the boys restroom without incident, and that the lower courts failure to grant the injunction reversed the status quo. Its flipped, Davis said. There were no incidents, no disruptions then everything changed. There is no stigmatizing impact on anyone but [Grimm], he said. The judges were also curious with what defined a male or female. If [Grimm] had a sex change, would you allow him to use the boys restroom? Judge Floyd asked the school boards lawyer. Corrigan deferred to the school policy, saying that Grimm could if he changed his biological gender a term with an unclear meaning. Judge Floyd asked a similar question of Grimms lawyer. What restroom would somebody with a sex change use? Block replied that it would depend on the individuals gender identity. Grimm spoke to reporters in a news conference after the hearing. I was sort of thrust into this, he said. At first I was terrified, then I realized I have a platform, and I am going to use that platform to help people. Deirdre and David Grimm stood off to the side of the room while their son spoke to reporters afterward. Its hard to be a parent and not want to fight their battles for them, his mother said. But we have learned through this process he is his best advocate, and we are proud to be his parents. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

It was a short walk from Chasers Nightclub, where popular gay dance party Poof Doof is held every Saturday night. After going to check out the sticker himself, Henderson notified nearby police. One of them seemed quite surprised, Henderson said. I think hed been at the local station for quite some time and said he hadnt seen anything like it. Asked if the area around Chapel Street is generally quite gay-friendly, Henderson replied Absolutely. However, he added that in recent years there has been an influx of people on Friday and Saturday nights that he describes as more aggressive. Ive been living in the area for about ten years, and there used to be a sense of gay Melbourne, a lot of venues. A lot of them have moved out, and a lot of the venues that have moved in are straight, he said. The comments that Ive seen from a lot of younger gay men is that they do feel increasingly less safe. On Hendersons post in the LGBTI Facebook group Proud to be a second-class Australian, the sticker was described as disgusting and unbelievable. For a moment I thought I was looking at a picture from the 50s, unbelievable that ignorance and hate like this exists today, wrote one commenter. Im scared as hell, wrote another.

aS"Thirty-one women 14 of them transgender in a California jail say they have been subject to blanket, routine strip searches despite laws and policies that say individual suspicion is required. View this image  Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson AFP / Getty Images / Paul J. Richards Thirty-one women currently held in an immigration detention facility in California 14 of them transgender filed a complaint with federal and local authorities on Monday alleging they were subjected to humiliating, invasive strip searches in violation of state law and federal policy. The women are detained at the Santa Ana City Jail, where Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is holding people suspected of immigration violations. Strip searches of people in immigration detention at the Santa Ana City Jail are conducted without reasonable suspicion, sometimes by members of the opposite gender, in view of other detainees, in unsanitary conditions, and have turned into sexual assaults, said the complaint filed by the Community Initiatives for Visiting Immigrants in Confinement (CIVIC), which is representing the women. These strip searches re-traumatize victims of past sexual assault, deter attorney visits, and are inhumane, the complaint said. If women refuse to be searched, they are isolated, denied food, and pressured by threats of transfers and deportations until they comply with the search. Federal officials and Santa Ana officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. At the crux of the complaint, the women allege strip searches are routinely performed as a blanket policy including during booking and when the women are transferred rather than when officials have reasonable individual suspicion a woman may be carrying contraband. California Penal Code Section 4030, the complaint said, prohibits visual strip searches absent individual reasonable suspicion, and prohibits physical body cavity searches by non-medical personnel. They also contend that individual supsicion is also required under ICE guidelines and under federal court rulings. Both the transgender and cisgender women are told to strip naked, and an officer performs a visual inspection of the breasts, armpits, buttocks, and genitalia of the woman, the complaint said. The women are told to lift up their breast, spread apart the sides of their labia and to pull back their clitoral hoods to prove that they are not hiding contraband in their vagina or vulva. They are told to bend at the waist, spread their buttocks, and cough three times. Women who did not bend to the officers satisfaction are told to cough again. Particularly concerning, the complaint continues, is that women are routinely strip-searched after meeting with their attorneys. These searches, they say, may even deter people in immigration detention from meeting with their attorneys, compromising legal representation. Most of the transgender women underwent strip-searches by male guards and were given no option to be searched by a female guard, another violation of federal detention policy, the complaint said. ICE guidelines for handling transgender detainees state that strip searches will be conducted by staff of the same gender as the detainee, and that transgender detainees shall choose the gender of the staff conducting cavity searches. Strip searches at the Santa Ana City Jail amount to state-sanctioned sexual assaults on women, said Christina Fialho, an Orange County-based attorney and the co-executive director of CIVIC, said in a statement. Santa Ana City Jail has been operating outside the limits of the Constitution and state law, while flagrantly violating federal standards for strip searches. The complaint calls on authorities, including the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to investigate practices at the Santa Ana Jail and for the facility to adopt new policies.

aS"The International Olympic Committee has released a new set of guidelines for transgender athletes. View this image  International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach. The International Olympic Committee on Monday updated its guidelines for transgender athletes, saying Olympians do not need to undergo sex reassignment surgery to compete in the games. It is necessary that trans athletes are not excluded from the opportunity to participate in sporting competition, the guideline document states. To require surgical anatomical changes as a pre-condition to participation is not necessary to preserve fair competition and may be inconsistent with developing legislation and notions of human rights. Previously, transgender athletes were required by the IOC to undergo sex reassignment surgery and hormone therapy to compete in Olympic events. The IOCs new gender-specific guidelines vary greatly for trans male athletes and trans female athletes. The resulting guidelines suggest that people assigned male at birth are naturally stronger and more athletically inclined than people assigned female at birth. Those who transition from female to male are eligible to compete in the male category without restriction, the IOC announced. For athletes who transition from male to female, eligibility is subject to stipulations regarding self-identification and levels of testosterone. When an athlete identifies as female, [t]he declaration cannot be changed, for sporting purposes, for a minimum of four years. To become eligible, a trans female athlete must demonstrate that her total testosterone level in serum has been below 10nmol/L for at least 12 months prior to her first competition. Testosterone levels for trans female athletes [m]ust remain below 10 nmol/L throughout the period of desired eligibility to compete in the female category, and they may be tested regularly to determine testosterone levels. The IOC document references a 2015 decision by the Court of Arbitration for Sport regarding hyperandrogenism, the presence of naturally elevated levels of testosterone in female athletes. The court in 2015 vacated the International Association of Athletics Federations regulations that essentially banned athletes with hyperandrogenism, saying the association didnt provide enough scientific evidence about the relationship between enhanced testosterone levels and improved athletic performance in hyperandrogenic athletes. In its new transgender guidelines, the IOC says the association should presenting evidence to the court to support the reinstatement of its hyperandrogenism rules. But, instead of banning athletes with hyperandrogenism not eligible for female competition the athlete should be eligible to compete in male competition.

aS"As a trans woman, my relationship to makeup and accompanying cisnormative beauty ideals has been particularly fraught. My 2015 resolution was to stop wearing it entirely. Heres how things turned out. View this image  Illustration by BuzzFeed News In a New York cab on a rainy afternoon in Union Square last June, an hour before I was to appear on British national television, I opened the travel makeup palette I had just bought from Sephora while the car was stopped in traffic. In the clean, untouched mirror, I looked at my unremarkable face, and tried to decide whether to make myself beautiful. I was on my way to the BBC America studios on the West Side, for a live segment on BBC Newsnight about Caitlyn Jenners Vanity Fair cover. I hadnt worn makeup since the previous year, after I resolved to give it up in 2015. But the idea of going on TV in front of millions of people without any makeup on filled me with both excitement and terror. It was especially ironic, that fear of being seen bare-faced, given that what I was about to discuss was a magazine cover that instantly became the iconic image of transgender glamour as soon as it was revealed. Jenners Vanity Fair cover would eventually ignite debates over how trans women are expected to fit cisnormative beauty ideals, but on the day the cover came out, the Internets response was overwhelmingly positive; many people fawned over Jenners beauty and compared her to Jessica Lange. The February before, when she came out as trans in an interview with Diane Sawyer, Jenner appeared without makeup on, and kept referring to her female self in the third-person like she wasnt in the room. It was as though the person in front of Sawyer couldnt fully be a woman without womens makeup and clothes. I deeply identified with Jenner then; I felt the same way when I started transition. I needed to look as glamourous and conventionally beautiful as possible just to believe in the possibility of my womanhood, because thats what the world had taught me. All women go through a lot to be perceived as acceptable in society, but what trans women go through is particularly terrible. Its one thing to fear being called ugly if youre not wearing makeup, but another to be afraid of being called the vilest of slurs, beaten up, or worse. Even when Jenner has made a huge amount of effort to present herself according to conventional beauty norms for cisgender women, she continues to endure transphobic comments denying her womanhood, whether by Internet trolls or by prominent feminists like Germaine Greer and Elinor Burkett. Early in transition, when the world perceived me as male but I wanted to be seen as a woman, makeup was a fundamental step in getting other people to see me the way I wanted to be seen. I bought several makeup books and converted an old computer desk into a dedicated vanity. I used eyeshadow to pull focus away from my strong brow and contouring to soften my angular chin. Lipstick highlighted my pouty lips, the most feminine part of my face. With effort, I found that makeup gave me the means to have some control over how other people perceived my gender. And for an early-transitioning trans woman whose daily life was beset with moments when other people policed a womanhood I felt deeply within, I became addicted to the control that makeup gave me. Like a drug, the high that makeup supplied was temporary, and I depended on it more and more to feel whole. I would walk down the street to the admiring gazes of men, but every once in a while, someone would notice something the hardness of my face or my Adams Apple, maybe and the admiration so easily turned into disgust. And my reaction was to cover up even more, find even more ways to shroud myself in makeup so no one would see the ugliness they saw and that I saw in myself. I became less self-conscious as the years went by, and I relied on makeup less as hormones softened my face. But whenever I needed to make a good impression or feel better about myself, I still picked up my makeup case and spent those hours painting my face, to become momentarily intoxicated with the image I saw in the mirror, even though I knew that the makeup only masked my unhappiness. Thats why I found myself with a strong urge to separate my sense of self from the makeup Ive been so dependent on for such a long time. So when a friend asked me to contribute to an article about New Years Resolutions in 2015, I publicly resolved to give up being conventionally feminine, and the first thing I put away was my makeup. After years of living in fear of my bare face, I wanted to assert that theres nothing wrong with who I actually am. I wanted to exist without constantly thinking I was only acceptable if people saw me as beautiful and normal. I wanted to spend time without makeup so that I could better understand my relationship to it what it gave me and what it took away. View this image  Those first few weeks I stopped wearing makeup were remarkable not in what people said, but what they didnt say. People no longer called me fabulous or gorgeous, or mentioned my full lips or high cheekbones, those parts of my face I used to overemphasize because people who knew makeup advised me they were striking. In subtle ways, the power I felt from being perceived as attractive began to dissipate. People smiled at me less on the street, and men no longer opened doors for me. The small privileges of attractiveness Id gotten used to over my years of womanhood, from baristas making extra sure I got my coffee quickly to clothing store owners occasionally giving me discounts, no longer applied. Because Id been living as a woman for such a long time, a lot of the things that happened to me after I stopped wearing makeup were more typical of cisgender womens experiences, even though I often still felt self-conscious about being trans. It was as though my image of myself in my head had not caught up with what people actually saw. One of the immediate benefits of living my life without makeup was the realization that I no longer had to rely on it to be gendered female, and was not subjected to the kind of harassment I experienced early in transition. But the loss I felt for not being perceived as beautiful was still significant, especially when I noticed any number of trans celebrities be continually praised for their looks. I also saw a direct correlation between contentment and conventional cisgender beauty among the trans women on my social media feed. By not wearing makeup, it felt like I was giving up an advantage for no good reason, and I was tempted to slather it back on. I began to wonder how much of the measure of success I had achieved up to that point like having stable jobs and advanced degrees can be attributed not to my intelligence or hard work, but to peoples perceptions of me as passable and attractive. But I tried to quiet these voices in my head, resolving to give myself time to acclimate and understand what makeup was really about for me. It was during this period that I remembered what it was like before I felt all this pressure to look good. I spent an entire childhood to early adulthood hardly ever wondering whether I was attractive enough, because being attractive had little to do with my worth as a human being who was perceived as male. Being smart and talented were the most important qualities I needed to possess, and if I was cute, that was just a bonus. Had I grown up being perceived as a girl, it would have been drilled into me from the beginning that my looks are vital to my self-worth. As I continued to go out without makeup, I began to recall some of the things I liked about living as male pre-transition (contrary to popular belief, not all trans women are constantly miserable in their assigned gender). I loved how I could get out of bed, put on sweats and go out, not caring what other people thought of my appearance. I also began to notice a bunch of things I didnt need to worry about when I didnt have makeup on. I could rub my eyes whenever I want while Im working, or munch on snacks then wipe my lips with a napkin without worrying about ruining my lipstick. I didnt need to feel that weird weight of mascara when I blinked, or that odd texture of foundation on my skin. But most of all, I didnt have to constantly think about what my face looked like. So it wasnt a surprise that the first half of 2015 was one of my most productive periods. The mere fact that I wasnt faced with the reminder on a regular basis to think about how I looked freed me to think and write about pressing transgender issues that were so important to me. This included writing extensively on Caitlyn Jenner, from the time that she publicly disclosed her trans status to the time she unveiled her name and female presentation on the cover of Vanity Fair. My writing, and not my looks, was what landed me an invitation to be on British national television. View this image  Theres something deeply ironic about being a trans woman who has resolved not to wear makeup, being asked to comment about a trans womans glamour in front of millions of people. Needing to decide whether I could actually do that bare-faced was just icing on the cake or, more fittingly, blush on the foundation. As I got to the station, I was escorted to a waiting room and told I had fifteen minutes before I was on. I went into the restroom, looked in the mirror again, and asked myself if I could really go on without even a little bit of concealer. My face was splotchy; what would be so wrong with just some coverup on my T-zone? I opened the makeup palette Id just bought and stared at the untouched cake of powder, the color of my skin. I imagined using the coverup, but then it would make my skin too pale so I would have to add some blush. And if I did that I might as well line my lids to make my eyes pop, then my blonde lashes would look weird without mascara so Id use a few swipes of that. And I cant wear eye makeup without doing my lips so nothing wrong with a bit of liner, then  I found myself closing the palette. I bit then licked my lips to give them color and shine, then pinched my cheeks like I learned from Jane Austen, before going back to the waiting room. A production assistant escorted me to a small studio, where I was told to sit on a chair facing a camera and a single, bright light. The English trans presenter Paris Lees and BBC Newsnight host Evan Davis were in London while I would be plugged in from New York. Do you want to see yourself on the monitor? the PA asked, motioning to a screen on one side of the camera where I saw that the show had already started. I shook my head and she turned the monitor off. When the segment started, I imagined the face of a British guy as I spoke in front of the lens, and found myself not thinking at all about my own face as I discussed how Jenner shouldnt need to make herself up to be respected as a woman, and that the trans community has many pressing needs beyond visibility. A few days after my BBC appearance, I woke up with the urge to use my newly-acquired makeup palette. So I did, and tweeted out a selfie with this missive: It makes me feel pretty to fight for #transgender rights. As I looked at my made-up eyes and pink lips, I found myself no longer feeling the same self-doubt I used to feel every time I picked up a makeup brush. 2015 didnt end up being my year without makeup. 2015 was just the year I stopped letting makeup rule my life. If I could go on TV without makeup on, to share the screen with two incredibly glamorous women, I no longer needed whatever affirmation makeup gave me. And because of this, I no longer needed to throw out makeup altogether. By giving up control of how I looked, I ended up regaining control over my complete self.

aS"From celebrities discussing their identities on Snapchat, to a new generation embracing a no labels approach to sexuality, coming out looks different in 2016 than ever before. But could it really no longer be necessary? Kristen Stewart, Amandla Stenberg, Charlie Carver Jason Merritt / Getty Images Richard Shotwell/Invision / AP) Larry Busacca / Getty Images Anyone whos gone through it knows that you never come out just once. There are the bigger moments coming out to your parents, maybe, or to best friends or classmates or co-workers but there are the quotidian ones, too. A lesbian lets her gynecologist know why she doesnt need any birth control right now, thanks but no thanks. A bisexual man, swallowing his horror, tells a presumptive waiter that the guy hes sharing some fried calamari with is his boyfriend, not his brother. A nonbinary pansexual person dating a cisgender guy explains a million times over that even if their relationship looks straight from the outside, theyre actually super fucking queer. Just as often as LGBT people slog through these little everyday coming-outs, however, many choose certain moments to remain quietly, but assuredly, in. We decide to let our landlords assume our partners are just roommates. We dont disclose our gender identity or our sexual orientation at a bar when being heckled by an aggressive drunk. We let grandmothers and bosses and pastors assume were something we are not, out of love or a simple desire to keep the peace, or to assure our safety. Coming out is LGBT 101 at this point. There couldnt be a more boring question than When did you come out? or When did you know? yet queer people are asked both constantly. These questions are, of course, dumb and reductive, because no one could possibly offer a single clear-cut answer: Out versus In is not a binary, but a lifelong series of strange and shifting negotiations. Though Ellens Yep, Im gay cover may always be the coming-out of all coming-outs, an enormous and explicit public declaration has never been the extent of the practice for celebs or us normals. The supposed closets in which many of us crouched as children (and beyond) are not fixed and finite, nor or they identical for everyone. For some butch dykes, gender-nonconforming femmes the closet was never really there at all. Its an overused and radically unhelpful metaphor. And yet Coming Out still remains broadly defined in the way it was for Ellen, and long before her: as a status, spoken. As a before and after. Charlie Carver, the Teen Wolf actor who publicly came out last week on Instagram, summed it up in a tweet: I am one of a community that has to announce itself to be known. But now as more people are embracing the concept of sexual fluidity, some even refusing to label their orientations at all is that announcement really still necessary? View this image  instagram.com In a heteronormative world full of people who assume that everyone is straight and cisgender unless a bomb of queer signifiers blows up in their face, public declarations remain the only surefire way to convey queerness to a vast number of people. Carver has been one of a number of young stars to publicly announce their sexual orientation on social media in the last few weeks. His message was spread over five Instagram posts of the same image: a sign reading Be who you needed when you were younger. Two weeks ago, the brilliant 17-year-old actor Amandla Stenberg took over Teen Vogues Snapchat to advocate for a world in which everyone sees themselves reflected in the media, sharing that she identifies as a black, bisexual woman. Colton Haynes, an actor on Arrow (as well as Teen Wolf, alongside Charlie Carver), wrote an extremely ambiguous response on his Tumblr to a post referencing his secret gay past. Was it a secret? he wrote. Lets all just enjoy life & have no regrets :) It definitely wasnt a coming-out, but it wasnt quite a denial, either. While splashy cover stories used to be a popular option for famous gays ready to take the coming-out plunge from Ellens Time cover in 1997 to Lance Basss People cover in 2006 messages spread through a celebritys own social media platforms demonstrate the growing irrelevance of major media when it comes to celebs personal announcements, a trend John Herrman thoroughly documented in The Awl last month. While old-school coming-outs still do happen Olympic skier Gus Kenworthy revealed that he identifies as gay in ESPN The Magazine last October, and Caitlyn Jenners highly contentious Vanity Fair cover will likely go down in history as the most famous iteration of the genre covers look stodgy and conventional when celebs can now reach teens without the filters of publishers and PR people between them. Snapchat feels friendly and intimate; a magazine cover is a publicity statement. View this image  Sarah Paulson and Holland Taylor Charley Gallay / Getty Images But among celebrities announcing their queerness, whether ostentatiously in Big Media or through chiller routes like tweets or grams, there are plenty who eschew official admissions altogether. On the Death, Sex & Money podcast last December, actor Holland Taylor told host Anna Sale: I havent come out because I am out. I live out. The concurrent news that shes dating fellow actor Sarah Paulson boggled the minds of many, even though both women had been publicly affectionate IRL and on social media for months. Taylors not-coming-out recalled Jodi Fosters famously confusing speech at the 2013 Golden Globes, as well as Kristen Stewarts August cover story in Nylon, throughout which the interviewer was clearly fishing for some sort of sexuality pronouncement. I dont feel like it would be true for me to be like, Im coming out! Stewart said, as well as: Google me. Im not hiding. And she wasnt. At least by then. All summer, Stewart was constantly photographed by the paparazzi holding hands with her live-in girlfriend at the time, Alicia Cargile. But, as my very smart colleague Kate Aurthur wrote in an essay last June, when [Stewart] started dating a woman, it was as if she had suddenly become invisible. All photographic evidence of intimacy to the contrary, Stewart and Cargile were labeled gal pals and BFFs by the same tabloids that had put the minutiae of her dating life with men on blast. Stewart was, as always, incredibly visible in the media much more so than she would like but her rather overt queerness went unnoticed. Queer women, in particular, are constantly assumed to be straight, with their romantic relationships belittled as friendships or phases or performances for horny heterosexual men. While Stewarts queer cred has been glaringly obvious to lesbians everywhere for years, there are still plenty of clueless straight people out there who not knowing where to look or even to look still think of Stewart as the ex-girlfriend of Robert Pattinson and that English film director. Which is not Stewarts fault, or her responsibility. The onus shouldnt be on queer people to declare their otherness over and over. Still, in her Nylon interview, Stewart went further than just refusing to come out on someone elses terms. If you feel like you really want to define yourself, and you have the ability to articulate those parameters and that in itself defines you, then do it, she said, adding: Until I decide that Im starting a foundation or that I have some perspective or opinion that other people should be receivingI dont. Im just a kid making movies. It was a rather strange implication that, for her, to come out would mean she was taking up the mantle of queer activism, potentially lumped in with the likes of Ellen Page, whose own coming-out speech in 2014 at an HRC event was undeniably inspired by a social consciousness. Stewart also seemed to think that, were she to give herself a label, it would supersede the one label she does care about (I am an actress, man). Its a fair worry: The further anyone is from being a straight white cisgender man, the more they face pigeonholing in their careers. But those who can avoid self-identifying with a marginalized label by blending in with the majority do hold a particular privilege over those who cant particularly trans women of color, who, in their hyper-visibility, are targets for epidemic levels of violence. Stewarts comments share a certain kind of derision with Cate Blanchetts at the Cannes Film Festival last May. A Variety cover story quoted Blanchett as having been in past relationships with women many times, but Blanchett later claimed the reporter had taken her words out of context. Sexuality is a private affair, she told Cannes reporters. What happens these days is if you are homosexual, you have to talk about it constantly; it has to be the only thing; you have to put it before your work, before any other aspect of your personality. (Stephanie Fairyington shut down this rather ridiculous presumption in Slate: What Blanchett experiences as homosexualitys loud self-assertion is a faint whisper next to the roar of heterosexuality.) And then there was Matt Damon giving some acting advice in The Guardian last September. Whether youre straight or gay, people shouldnt know anything about your sexuality because thats one of the mysteries that you should be able to play, he said a curious instruction, since he personally makes no effort to deny the fact that hes married to a woman. Damon, Blanchett, and Stewart cant seem to conceive of a world wherein someone can own up to being gay without their gayness taking over every aspect of their personhood and professionalism or at least, without the media assuming as much. Time People Vanity Fair After the Nylon interview, Stewart was championed as someone who refuses to publicly label herself. Denouncing labels when it comes to sexual orientation is au courant, for what is probably a conflation of many reasons. The average coming-out age has been radically dropping, and many young people are taking the much-needed time to figure themselves out and explore before closing in on a name for their sexuality, should they ever. Back in August, when 16-year-old Lily-Rose Depp posed for the Self Evident Truths Project, a portrait series of thousands of Americans who identify as not 100% straight, the headlines declared shed come out as such. Last week, Girl Meets World actor Rowan Blanchard tweeted that shes also joined the No Labels camp, saying that even though she has only ever liked boys, she doesnt want to identify as straight gay or whateva, nor does she want to give herself labels to stick with. The 14-year-old is interested in just existing. For the young and questioning, No Labels/Anything but Straight offers a hallowed space for self-discovery in those very confusing early years of sex and dating. But many believe even hope that this trend is much bigger than young people finding themselves. An increasingly popular hypothesis about fluidity and queerness predicts that were all hurtling toward a future of sexual fluidity, when all labels will be collapsed into meaninglessness. One such study propagating this theory, out of the University of Essex last November, claimed that women are either bisexual or gay, but never straight. (It was widely criticized; one of the best shakedowns came from Anna Pulley in The Cut, who points out that just because women are biologically turned on by stimuli doesnt mean their brains are always on the same page.) Another poll, conducted by YouGov in August 2015, used the six-point Kinsey scale to determine that 1 in 3 Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 plot themselves as something other than exclusively heterosexual. Of that same American demographic group, however, 84% identify as heterosexual which means that, presumably, of the 31% who didnt plot themselves as completely straight, roughly half identify as straight regardless. View this image  Lily-Rose Depp and iO Tillett Wright of the Self Evident Truths project Instagram: @iolovesyou Rather than repressing queer feelings, it seems as though many young people are opening themselves up to at least the possibility of queer experience. All the more fascinating, then, is that while young people are more open to different kinds of attraction than ever, many who fall somewhere in the middle of the Kinsey scale still call themselves heterosexual which is, of course, a label, like any other. So are not 100% heterosexual and not 100% straight labels which, even as they try to distance themselves from heterosexuality, manage to center it. A never say never attitude even for straight people, especially for straight people when it comes to sexuality is undoubtedly a healthy one, particularly because the boundaries of gender are beginning to gloriously crumble around us. Those atrocious videos of lesbians touching penises for the first time, or gay men who try kissing straight women, assume an extremely narrow breadth of not only queer, but human experience there are, in fact, lesbians with penises, just as there are gay men with vaginas. Our labels, as much as we try to hold fast to them, are beginning to strain at the seams, and were being forced to interrogate what our queerness means to us. So much the better. In Maggie Nelsons quietly explosive book, The Argonauts, she grapples with whether or not language can keep up with the way we fuck, the way we live. There are no longer binary machines: question-answer, masculine-feminine, man-animal, etc., she writes. This could be what a conversation is simply the outline of a becoming. The call for sexual fluiditys revolution does sound like an exciting conversation, particularly on the level of individual personal agency why the hell not open yourself up to possibilities you might have once thought closed off to you? but as a social trend, or even as a social prescription, the conversation leads to dead ends. When Rowan Blanchard tweeted that she didnt want to label herself, many fans tweeted back with confusion. Open to liking any gender in [the] future is why I identify as queer, she clarified in a follow-up tweet, seemingly reneging on her pact to stay label-less. But have you actually been attracted to more than one gender :/ being open to it is not the same, another fan tweeted back to her. A 14-year-old girl should by no means feel compelled to predict her whole romantic future and policing other peoples conceptions of their own queerness is, of course, a zero-sum game but questioning attraction versus openness draws an interesting distinction nonetheless. In terms of the bigger picture, its easy enough for the more cynical among us to feel as though culturally equating a hint of queer possibility with attraction and action could lead to people of any age co-opting queerness for its current cool factor. In 2016, renouncing labels is often hailed as forward-minded and cosmopolitan an admirable way to exist above the fray of identity politics whereas, for example, bisexuals and pansexuals who unabashedly label their interest in more than one gender are still stereotyped as greedy, slutty, and indecisive. Encouraging people to explore their sexualities without feeling confined to a label is all well and good (even if it means that a few will end up dubiously claiming queerness along the way), but supporting a future in which we all eschew labels altogether in the name of fluidity is not only futile, but potentially damaging to everyone who has finally felt at home in an identity discovered and claimed. Human sexuality is a big, messy, extraordinary thing, and as our conception of gender identity grows, its only going to get messier but invoking the spectrum to indicate that Come on, man, everybodys just a little fluid, bro, doesnt do most queers any favors. What does it matter who you sleep with? anonymous posters complain in the comments section of yet another coming-out story. Why is anyones sexuality even a big deal anymore? Cant we all just be people? Cate Blanchett put it this way, back when she was shutting down the lesbian rumor mill: In 2015, the point should be: who cares? Its a delicious proposition. If we dont label ourselves, perhaps we wont be othered and oppressed at long last. But a better question might be (updated for the new year): In 2016, why do we still care? Why do interviewers keep fishing for celebs to out themselves? Why, when famous people we admire give themselves a label and share it with the world, do the news stories written about them still go viral? Maybe because heteronormativity is still such a looming presence that anyone who rejects it even in the simplest, most banal way of public self-identification is doing something thats still rather rare (LGBT people remain, after all, a minority). Maybe because there are plenty of people in this world for whom more coming-outs is a danger and a threat. Maybe because anyone who identifies as heterosexual can be opened up to the world of queer possibility when identities like bisexuality are asserted and validated. Maybe because young and questioning kids want to believe they can grow up to be movie stars or titans of industry without having to painstakingly avoid being seen around or even mentioning their significant others, lest they be criticized for shoving their queerness down everyones throats or worse, harassed or fired from their jobs. On Twitter, Teen Wolfs Charlie Carver said that his sexuality was not a secret to many, but I felt it necessary to share (until coming out is a thing of the past). Thats the dream: when famous coming-outs will no longer be news; when all queers can roam the world openly without having to explain themselves over and over, without having their right to health and happiness violated once they do. But insinuating that people should simply stop doing it, or no longer need to whether on a magazine cover, in a speech, on social media; to one person, to a million is not quite the answer. If anything, the more people who claim queerness, the more normalized it will become and the less fanfare it will inspire. That isnt to say, though, that queer people should have to keep explaining themselves ad nauseum especially because it isnt always safe. Perhaps there is a happy medium to be reached someday, where casually alluding to ones own gender identity or sexuality is no big deal, while we simultaneously stop assuming that everyone is straight and cisgender unless they explicitly tell us otherwise. Mentioning a partner of the same gender should be as normal as asking someone for their preferred pronouns. And why not encourage straight and cisgender people to both announce and interrogate their own labels for a change? If LGBT people are still pressed to come out particularly trans and gender-nonconforming people, who, when disclosing their identities, risk being vigorously policed, shamed, doubted, and met with unspeakable violence then, until straight/cis is no longer the assumed default, so should we all. How can the words not be good enough? Nelson writes in The Argonauts. Our words: trans, genderqueer, bisexual, lesbian, gay, pansexual, intersex, nonbinary, asexual, on and on and on, a train of labels which can feel restrictive and limiting one moment and like salvation, like home, the next. They are flawed, powerful, and ever-evolving words. They are words soaked with the blood and sweat of generations of people who fought, no matter the costs, for our right to claim them. Queer, dyke, fag: words used to assault and humiliate, which we can wear, if we so choose, as a big old fuck you to everyone who once weaponized them against us. Are the words enough? Alone, they arent. Not even close. But that doesnt mean we shouldnt keep shouting them.  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .

aS"The bill that was scheduled to be debated on Friday would have effectively punished gays and lesbians for coming out. View this image  Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev addresses the Duma Pavel Golovkin / AP A proposal in the Russian parliament that could have punished gays and lesbians who come out with up to two weeks in jail has stalled just as it was scheduled for its first reading. The bill was scheduled to be debated in the Duma on Friday, but the chamber adjourned without taking it up. The Dumas Committee on Constitutional Legislation voted Monday to recommend rejecting the bill, but it remained on the Dumas calendar for Fridays session and LGBT rights advocates told BuzzFeed News that they were concerned it could still be adopted over the Committees recommendation. Even now, some advocates do not consider the threat to have passed. They might have just run out of time to debate the bill on Friday, Polina Andrinova of the St. Petersburg group Coming Out said in a message to BuzzFeed News. Well have to see if it gets added to the next agenda. The law had advanced further inside the Dumas legislative process than any anti-LGBT bill since 2013s so-called gay propaganda law; others were never even given a spot on the legislative agenda. But its passage was always in question because it was proposed by opposition lawmakers from the Communist Party, and the United Russia Party led by President Vladimir Putin solidly controls the Duma. LGBT advocates were still concerned that discussion of the law had given a platform for anti-LGBT rhetoric from the bills sponsors, and worried it could spark renewed anti-LGBT violence. In an interview published by Meduza last week, one of the sponsors, Ivan Nikitchuk, said that the law was need to stop sick and crazy people from displaying their demonic desires which the West has forced on us. And all these bearded men kissing is nothing but nauseating, he said. The bill was pending as a court in the city of Murmansk fined an LGBT advocate named Sergei Alekseyenko the equivalent of $1,200 under the gay propaganda law, which technically is supposed to only punish promoting non-traditional sexual relationships to minors. Alekseyenko was the head of the Murmansk Center, an LGBT rights group shuttered in office after the Russian government declared it to be operating as a foreign agent in the country.

aS"Months after I voided my ex, he voided our relationship. View this image  Andrew Richard / BuzzFeed My husband, my home, our dog, my best friend, my mother who was left to lose? It had all taken place in 16 months, and I suppose its better to get it all over with than to have it happen over time, sanding you down little by little. I picked the building because its ornate surface reminded me of Manhattans London Terrace apartments, eight blocks from my old home. It was said that Deborah Harry and Susan Sontag had lived in London Terrace, and I figured local facsimiles of those high-spirited types would be found on its upper floors. But the neighborhood in my new chosen city of Philadelphia was full of a different kind of people, wary of strangers, afraid of crime. My fellow residents put on a hard face whenever you passed them in the hallways. I tried to get a hello back but it usually wasnt successful. My apartment and this was a matter of accident happened to look out over my late best friend Denises building. I spentfar too much time alone. To ground myself, I pictured myself jumping repeatedly from the ledge of my 21st-story window. I must have died 12 times a day that year. A whole city of the dead inside me.  View this image  I was back in Manhattan for the day, on my way to a party at a friends apartment in Tribeca. I was thinking up sentences, daydreaming as I usually do when I walk through New York, when I looked up and saw a face. The shock wasnt simply his smile, which had more than a little swagger and mischief in it. The shock was that Id seen that face online earlier in the day as I scrolled casually, half asleep, through a hookup site, fantasizing about whom I could possibly meet in New York, though I didnt intend to pursue such a thing. Hed leapt off the screen with unrestricted wattage, and now here he was with even more, enough to pulverize stone. A current went up my spine, as we kept walking to our respective destinations his to the north, mine south looking over our shoulders, stopping, walking, looking over our shoulders again. This transpired over the course of a block. We smiled so much we were practically laughing. When had I last been unafraid? Until that moment it was as if I hadnt known what my type was. Now I thought I knew: broad, big chest; shaved head; thick beard; hair curling out the collar of his T-shirt. Wise-guy smile. At the party, I kept thinking, You should have stopped to talk to him. Youd have a different life if you allowed yourself to be late. Later that night, back in my new, hard city, I glanced at Facebook. A new message: I wanted to stop. View this image  I could point to things we had in common. Wed both lost lovers wed really adored. Wed both grown up in New Jersey, but in different parts of the state. We had mutual friends in multiple worlds, lives in writing: It turned out he had an MFA in fiction. Hed seen me at a reading once, knew I was a writer, knew the titles of my books. But our real connection? We loved to laugh. How many hours a day did we try to makeeach other laugh? It was a facet of our sex, and maybe our best sex: trying to crack each other up. He was always much funnier on the spot than I was, and I loved trying to keep up with him. There was a little competition to this banter, but only the best kind. Sometimes Id simply surrender: touch. It felt like being pushed down onto the bed and giving in to someones mouth, even though most of these exchanges transpired in texts. It felt a little dangerous, this giving in, especially when I was putting more energy than I knew into taking care of myself. It was all I could do to eat, to teach, to keep getting out of bed each morning. I was very skinny 30 pounds lighter than Id been the year before. He was 12 years younger than I was, which didnt seem to matter much. He was still in a lot of ways a boy, and I suppose I was too, especially now that Id left 16 years of married life behind. Age-wise, we met somewhere in the middle and shared many of the same tastes. I loved the fact his were broad and idiosyncratic, from low culture to high: Laura Nyro to Stravinsky to old cartoons to The Night of the Hunter. View this image  What is a relationship? Six months or sixteen years: It all comes down to a handful of images. To tell a linear story would be to tell a lie. There are always concurrent narratives, and you cant tell one without canceling the other one out. But images live outside time and causality. They float out there, as in a satellite. Image 1: The parking lot of an Olive Garden in Monmouth County, New Jersey. He liked to smoke weed, and I was going along, even though I didnt think it was necessarily the smartest thing to do by the front door. He loved Olive Garden, as only someone who managed a high-powered Williamsburg restaurant could love Olive Garden. The salty, processed food was practically exotic to someone who barely got outside the city anymore. It was the taste of childhood. We liked the fact that we could share this kind of adventure without feeling judged by the other, and as soon as we stepped up to the hosts station, we cracked up. Our server, a woman in her sixties with long red hair, responded to us instantly, as if we were fellow aliens who had dropped in from the most recently named moon of Neptune. We didnt yet know wed reference her name repeatedly in the months ahead, not with sarcasm, but as a kind person who took care of us for one memorable night. Image 2: The Met, where we step toward Saracenos Cloud Country, a climbable plexiglass installation, on the roof. I hadnt expected the sun to be so blinding when I checked my bag earlier, and it was doing me in now. The plexiglass only refracted it, intensifying the light. It was all I could do to cover my eyes with my hands, but he coaxed me forward. Come on, he said, grabbing me by the hand. I know your eyes hurt, but look! The skyscrapers turned upside down in the glass! Image 3: A deep blue pool on the outskirts of Key West. He stood on the diving board, chugging his arms, clear drink in hand, revving everybody up. Goofy and sexy at once. One guy went up to talk, and then another. In part it was flattering to be associated with the star attraction of the compound, but I also felt completely on my own, retreating into my book in the lounge while he and the others splashed. View this image  I was probably more excited about the prospect of the hurricane than I should have been. Three months after wed first started dating, Id moved 84 miles to Asbury Park, a place I once thought of as Chernobyl-by-the-Sea but was now experiencing a resurgence. Id felt lifted by my move, and you could feel the relief in the pictures I took from those first months. The colored umbrellas on Bradley Beach, like a postcard of Rimini; the little boat, just beyond the wave break, lighting the dusk with its big beam. Id managed to turn the old steam plant into an image out of Fellinis Amarcord and I hadnt even been trying. Plus, it was a relief to move one hour closer to New York. Id pictured him coming down whenever he had a few days off. He loved the beach, he could stay all day in the water if he wanted to, and my house, just three blocks in from the boardwalk, was a much more welcoming place to visit than my old neighborhood in Philadelphia, which always prompted him to say, with comic suspicion, does anybody live here? View this image  Three days before the storms approach, the sea was ferocious, boiling. I went outside with two guys at the end of Convention Hall where it hung out over the water, and we stood mesmerized by the waves as a nearby bars sound system roared Megadeth. I think the point was that Megadeth sounded as bombastic as the ocean, but the music couldnt hold a candle. Once the storm finally arrived, I had everything I needed: flashlight, packaged foods, jugs of water. I started calling my friends as if they too were stepping outside of time, putting their deadlines aside, even though they were in places like D.C. and Austin, far from the emergency. Dont you think you should evacuate? more than one of them said. Too late now, I said, with an odd bit of pride. And besides, who would want to miss out on such a thing? How would I feel if I were sitting inside some motel, down at the end of some carpeted hall, when life was happening here? The winds wrenched the house right and left. Trusty house: It was incredible in its ability to take it. At one point I even went out to walk in the wind, toward the beach. The rain pounded my brow. I got as far as a block and felt my chest do something funny against all that force, as if it were about to be used as a sail. And then the power went out. It went out with a sigh, as if a large, old animal had been punched. The night sky went darker than any dark Id ever seen, and I knew the light was going to stay out for a good long time. When morning came, the house was damp, chilled. I hadnt thought about the furnace not working. Water still ran through the faucet, but other than that the walls felt sheer, the thinnest membrane. I put on my heaviest winter coat and slugged through town. Fifty-foot trees uprooted, carp in the gutters of Ocean Avenue, a vast cavern torn through the roof of the Great Auditorium. View this image  They put a fence up around the boardwalk not just any fence, but a three-story-high fence, industrial, chain-link, running from the north end of town to the south. It closed off the water, the horizon line. It made as much sense to seal off the sky. Even if you managed to pull two sections of the fence apart, youd be risking arrest for doing nothing more than standing on the beach. I hadnt heard from him for days. Power had been restored, but I hadnt had an urge to reach out. I suppose I was testing something. Why did I always have to be the one to say good morning? Who knew when that had started, and why was I supplying the energy to keep it going? When he did phone to ask how I was, I admitted Id been pretty depressed. I tried to keep the need out of my voice; I wasnt asking for acknowledgement or sympathy. I just liked the freedom to say it aloud, but I kept it casual as if I were telling him I had blueberries for dessert. Let me call you back, he said in a rougher voice than usual. He didnt sound pleased. Who knows what was going on with him that day? How many past due bills were assembled on his desk? Was the L train still not running? Could he still not get to work? And what about that batty landlord? Was she still walking into his room with her top off? When he called me back he said depression was an illness of the privileged, along with a few other things I was unable to take in. Id never heard anything like that in my life. I didnt want to hate him. The silence after that felt wide and stunning, a sea we could jump into together. I imagined taking his hand. Rather than yell, I talked about the rest of my day, the tasks I had to attend to. Books to read, student manuscripts that asked for circles and checks and other symbols. The casual friendliness of my voice probably sounded like murder to him. I had voided him; he felt it. I wasnt going to see him again. The devotion must have been gone from my voice and I was just another person who was going to walk away after hed said too much. I doubt hed expected that of me. Maybe he thought Id shudder and flinch, as if my shoulders were hooked into strings. Then I went into a deep chamber for months, maybe more. One night I was driving down Route 35, a highway empty of cars after 10 p.m., yelling words that didnt make sense to me. I kept yelling words until they fell out of natural order. View this image  I suppose I could have started this piece by saying this is a piece about voiding someone. It seemed to me more important to get him, us, on the page. To say relationship, especially when I have written entire books about the loss of other relationships. It seems like thats all I write about these days, these people, these places Ive lost. And yet some people come back to say hello, and if not to stick around, then only to suggest theyre findable, reachable. Maybe that isnt so unusual these days, when were all so easy to capture online. One night, half asleep, I was scrolling from site to site in bed. NPR, SF Gate, YouTube, Redtube And that face, the brawny intensity of it. Earlier in our time together hed talked casually about doing porn. Maybe hed find his way toward it someday, but he mentioned it like he was interested in taking a trip to Canada, and here he is, looking like hed been a resident of British Columbia all his life. I watch him pushing, leaning in, doing his work as in a dream. I sort of wish he were having more fun at it, but I am not exactly an uninvolved witness. If only he knew how to make use of the sexiest thing about him, which is that smile, always about to erupt into mischief: class clown. But porn isnt the country for the smiling. Months later, I come across a website for people dealing with loss. Most of the posts are composed in the well-meaning turns and tropes of grief language, but then I find a voice much stranger than that, more genuine, honest, wounded. Can you tell where this is leading? Him again, in another guise, writing about the partner hed lost 14 years prior. He writes with deepest affection for this partner, the trips theyd taken, the apartment they shared, the poetry they read together: Cummings, Auden, and Yeats. I read every paragraph two, three times. Then I read the whole thing backwards. I am at home in his sentiments. I know exactly what he means when he talks about his body mourning. And yet Im stumped by his announcement he hasnt dated since this partners death. Oh, there had been men, he says, but no one ever held him tightly enough. Hookups with cuddle benefits. Its almost stunning, this sweet erasure, to find out there was never any story between us to lose.

Showrunner Jason Rothenberg spoke to BuzzFeed News about why his bisexual lead wont label herself. SPOILERS through the Season 3 premiere. View this image  Clarke (Eliza Taylor) and Lexa (Alycia Debnam-Carey) have been allies, enemies, and potential romantic partners on The 100. The CW Late in Season 2 of The 100, Clarke (Eliza Taylor) and her enemy-turned-ally Lexa (Alycia Debnam-Carey) shared an unexpected lip-lock that set social media on fire. Suddenly, Clarke, a character that had been assumed to be straight her only prior romantic pairing was with Finn (Thomas McDonell) earned an exciting new dimension as a queer woman. Thus, the hashtag #Clexa was born. It blew up on Twitter and Tumblr, and remains a hotbed of enthusiastic shipping. Enthusiasm aside, some viewers doubted Clarkes attraction to women, seeing as she and Lexa only kissed once, and Clarke pulled away. But the Season 3 premiere of the post-apocalyptic CW series, which aired Jan. 21, should put those concerns to rest. On the run from her own people and others who would do her harm, Clarke found herself seeking comfort from Grounder trading post worker Niylah (Jessica Harmon), and eventually fell into the strangers bed. She just wants to escape her pain. And part of the way people escape pain, the way they do in our world and in the world of the show, is you numb out or you take drugs or you drink or you have sex with people, showrunner Jason Rothenberg explained in a phone interview with BuzzFeed News. For even those few minutes, shes not feeling bad shes feeling sexual, and thats a good thing. Clarke and Niylah (Jessica Harmon) have sex. The CW The CW Rothenberg could have paired Clarke with anyone, but he deliberately chose a female character in hopes of clarifying his heroines sexuality for good. There were some whispers in certain quarters maybe this was on Twitter, I dont know of people not believing that Clarke was in fact bisexual, because of the way the relationship with Lexa had played out in Season 2, he said, referring to the fact that Clarkes grief over being forced to kill Finn led her to halt things with Lexa before theyd really begun. I wanted to put that to bed. And so, I chose Niylah as opposed to Nigel, so it could be once and for all clear that she is attracted to people of both sexes. Given how limited representation of bisexual characters is onscreen, bisexual viewers are eager to see themselves on The 100. But though Rothenberg continues to refer to Clarke as bisexual, the character will likely never proclaim her sexual identity on the series anytime soon. Clarke and Lexa kissed without any discussion of their preferences, and the episodes that followed didnt address their orientations either, which has resulted in some pushback. Those dissenting voices of The 100s matter-of-fact approach toward sexuality might soon find themselves wondering why Miller (Jarod Joseph) whose boyfriend was first mentioned in the Season 3 premiere wont be identifying himself either. I certainly get some criticism in my Twitter feed about how labels are important and I should use labels, and Clarke should call herself bisexual. I dont even know that they would have that term, Rothenberg said. I get that labels are very, very important in our world, and you should be proud of who you are, and you should be able to state it proudly, and, Fuck you if you dont agree with the way I live my life, but thats just not the way it is in the show. Miller (Jarod Joseph), center, in Season 2. The CW Clarke and Niylah (Jessica Harmon) in the Season 3 premiere. The CW While it may not satisfy all queer fans, Rothenbergs perspective on LGBT representation on The 100 is one of the most unique and progressive on television. On the series, which is set nearly a century after a nuclear war that destroyed the vast majority of humanity, characters are defined by more than their orientations. At the same time, their desires are more than incidental: The 100 does not shy away from depictions of same-sex affection and intimacy. The way The 100 treats its queer characters is radically different from the vast majority of television shows. Its rare and laudable for a series to embrace diverse sexual identities in a way that puts them at the forefront of the story without making sexuality the dominant theme of the narrative. But, as Rothenberg notes, its also a factor of the setting in which the series takes place. The world of The 100 is one without sexual orientation, in part because its a world where homophobia doesnt exist survivors have bigger concerns than other peoples relationships. Its a little bit idealized, obviously, cause its not like our world, where there are still battles to be fought on those fronts. But the battle for who you want to sleep with, who you love, is over in my post-apocalypse, Rothenberg said. Nobody is giving you a hard time in the world of this show. No ones parents are upset to find out their son is gay. Thats just not a thing. Its an attractive fantasy, one of the few in the bloody, brutal universe of The 100. The young people on the series grew up without any knowledge that same-sex pairings were ever taboo, because, for the most part, their parents were too busy teaching them how to stay alive. Thats the sort of worldview that I wish existed, and so we just say, Why not? Miller is gay. Big deal, Rothenberg said. Clarke and Lexa share their first kiss. The CW The CW The writers arent nave, however: They know there are political and cultural implications that come with queer representation. And while theyre not concerned with homophobes who are turned off by The 100 because of its same-sex relationships, they do pay attention to LGBT viewers who want to watch accurate on-screen depictions of queer life. Its a complicated line to walk, especially for Rothenberg, who has made a point of not letting fan desires affect his writing. (If that were the case, he wouldnt kill off so many of your favorites.) But the result of Rothenbergs commitment to strong storytelling above all else is that The 100 doesnt look like anything that came before it. Its making major strides forward with every episode its grounded, straightforward queerness is just one of many things The 100 is getting right. In the real world, we have relationships and thats a big part of our lives, and so its a color in the crayon box. Its not the crayon box, Rothenberg said. Im trying to tell the story as I see it, and hope that people like it. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .

aS"Exclusive: When a British mans husband died on honeymoon in Australia last week, the death certificate read never married. In response, the British government has announced a change in policy to prevent this from happening again. Marco Bulmer-Rizzi Getty David and Marco Bulmer-Rizzi If a same-sex couple travels to Australia and one spouse dies, their marriage can now be recognised on the death certificate, the Foreign Office confirmed to BuzzFeed News. The announcement comes following a BuzzFeed News report earlier this week about a British man Marco Bulmer-Rizzi whose husband died on honeymoon in South Australia, and who was told by the local authorities that the death certificate would read never married as the state does not recognise overseas same-sex marriages. Australia was, until today, one of five countries along with Ireland, New Zealand, Canada, and South Africa exempt from a UK policy that enables Britons to get UK-style death certificates. Because of the Bulmer-Rizzi case, this loophole has now been closed. As of Friday, when a British national dies in any of those five countries (along with all other foreign countries) the death certificate will be issued by the country of death, but in a UK format. In this format, there is a column headed signature, description and residence of informant, in which the relationship between the person registering the death and the deceased can be expressed: e.g. widow. View this image  A Foreign Office spokesperson told BuzzFeed News: The theory was that these five countries are for most purposes the same as the UK in terms of how they do their death certificates. This case [involving the Bulmer-Rizzis] has pointed out that theyre not the same in every respect, so thats why its been changed. Bulmer-Rizzi was told last weekend in the hours after the death following an accident of his husband, David Bulmer-Rizzi, that the Australian death certificate did not allow for same-sex marriages to be stated, so his would read never married. When Marco Bulmer-Rizzi challenged this, he said, he was informed that same-sex marriages were not one of the drop-down options on the computer. Bulmer-Rizzi said he is delighted by the new policy, which means no one else will have their marriage denied by such official documents. After explaining on Facebook what the British consulate told him about the end of such exemptions, he said: Even better, and all I ever wanted, it will show my name as the applicant and my relationship to David as husband. He added: I am getting so emotional just thinking about how much change we have enabled and the support has been incredible. One lesson Ive learntyou should never be afraid to stand [up] for what you believe in. View this image  Marco Bulmer-Rizzi The original story sparked widespread outrage both in Australia and internationally, and prompted Jay Weatherill, the premier of South Australia, to personally telephone Bulmer-Rizzi and apologise. Weatherill also pledged to change the law in the next few months so the state of South Australia will recognise overseas same-sex marriages. The case has also reignited the debate about same-sex marriage across Australia, which, unlike New Zealand, the UK, the US, Canada, France, Spain, Ireland, and 15 other countries, does not allow it. Australian Marriage Equality, the countrys leading organisation campaigning for same-sex marriage, launched a petition citing the Bulmer-Rizzi case with the words: Imagine not having your marriage recognised. Help make sure this never happens again. Thousands have signed it in the past 48 hours as the fight for equal marriage in Australia continues apace.

aS"Her Story, the new six-episode series about trans and queer women navigating their professional and dating lives, is setting out to change the way we think about high-quality trans media. View this image  Violet (Jen Richards) and Allie (Laura Zak) share a moment. Speed of Joy Productions Early in the just-launched web series Her Story, streaming now on YouTube, Violet (Jen Richards) and Allie (Laura Zak) have lunch at a laid-back L.A. restaurant for the first time. Allies writing an article about trans women for a local gay rag. She asks Vi whether she was a gay man pre-transition, then apologizes when Vi laughs awkwardly and demurs. Its OK, Vi says. Before transition, I actually dated women. When Allie asks her whether her current preference for men means Vi prefers straight men over gay men, she replies, Its not about them. Its about me. When Im with a man I have no doubt about my womanhood. My body next to theirs is so obviously feminine. Vi goes on to talk about how she cant help but notice, for example, how much bigger her hands are compared to Allies and how it makes it harder for her as a trans woman to see herself with a cis woman. This is the kind of deeply complicated insight that escapes writers who observe trans experience from the outside rather than living it from within. When Her Story screened for the first time at the NewFest LGBT Film Festival in New York last October, a palpable silence followed this scene, punctuated by sniffles, as it brought a number of trans women in the audience to tears. Besides starring in Her Story, Richards and Zak also co-wrote the script. Richards close friend and former roommate Angelica Ross plays the third lead, Paige, a black trans civil rights lawyer who has to deal with not disclosing her status in both her personal and professional lives. Another trans woman, Sydney Freeland, directed the series, and Zaks friend Katherine Fisher serves as head producer. At a time when trans people are titillating curiosities for mainstream audiences, the worlds of film and television are finally beginning to spotlight trans lives but in almost all cases, those stories are being told by cisgender creators, with cisgender actors. When accused of cashing in on trans stories without actually involving the creative talent of trans people, higher-ups in entertainment tend to offer this excuse: There just arent enough qualified trans directors, writers, and actors to go around. With Her Story, Richards, Zak, and Ross set out to blow major holes in that excuse while also, of course, creating a high-quality series on par with mainstream standards, a success in its own right. Im so glad its good, Laverne Cox told the gathered audience at NewFest before she moderated a Q&A with the cast and crew, likely echoing the sentiment of everyone in the room. Her Story is a groundbreaking show that explores trans and queer womens lives in deeply nuanced ways, one that moves squarely away from depictions of trans women as stereotyped curiosities for mainstream audiences.  View this image  Zak, actor Angelica Ross, cinematographer Brnice Eveno, and director Sydney Freeland confer on the set of Her Story. Speed of Joy Productions Originally the scale was very small, Zak told BuzzFeed News about the original plan for Her Story. We were just wanting to do something very low-budget shot in Chicago, that probably only our friends would see. Zak and Richards had met on the set of another queer web series, #Hashtag, where Richards had a cameo as a trans waitress who has a flirtatious moment with Zaks character. Richards was just starting out as an actress and writer in Los Angeles after doing trans advocacy work in Chicago, while Zak had more experience as the series co-creator of #Hashtag, after almost a decade as a manager and event producer for Eve Enslers V-Day womens anti-violence project. Zak described herself and Richards as having a lot of friend chemistry, so when Richards brought up the idea of exploring the relationship between their trans and cis womens characters in #Hashtag, Zak agreed to co-write and find a producer. We pretty quickly decided to craft an entirely new story and new world separate from the previous web series, Zak said. It felt like this story, and this type of love story, really deserved its own show and its own platform. The original idea also included a major plotline based on the experiences of Richards Chicago roommate Ross, the CEO of TransTech Social Enterprises, a design and technology firm that hires and trains trans people. In Her Story, Ross plays civil rights attorney Paige, who dates men and constantly struggles about when to tell them shes trans. It was always a given that [Ross] was going to be a part of it, Richards told BuzzFeed News. I really just felt like I had this bright shining star who wasnt up in the sky yet, and I had the chance to harness some of its power. With a primary cast in place, Zak showed the script to Katherine Fisher, a friend who was starting her own production company after working for many years as Events Director at V-Day, and Fisher decided to tackle Her Story as her first project. I came into this really in love with the script and wanting to put us in a position where Jen and Laura and Angelica can do their best work, trying to create that kind of safe space, Fisher told BuzzFeed News. The creative teams first task was to find a director, and one of the other producers for the show, Sarah Baker Grillo, came up with the idea of approaching Sydney Freeland, who had just directed the feature Drunktowns Finest, which featured a transgender character though, at the time, the team had no idea that Freeland was trans herself. When I met with them, they were talking to me about Janet Mock and went on about her background as though they were talking to someone who wasnt trans, Freeland told BuzzFeed News. I assumed they already knew. I thought these people were just really really polite! Fisher went on to assemble the rest of the cast and crew, which ended up consisting of about 80% women, half of whom were either queer or trans. Principal photography took place over 14 days in late April and early May, after which they reshot a couple of scenes in August. When we first showed up on set the first day, we were really overwhelmed, Richards said. We couldnt believe this little idea we had commanded so many resources and so many talents. Richards also emphasized that many people cut their pay rates to support the show, which operated on a $100,000 production budget modest by Hollywood standards raised through a crowdfunding campaign, modest grants, and private donors. From the beginning it all felt very communal; it felt like we were all in this together. Ross also relishes having a capable team behind Her Story. Usually when youre trying to get visibility around something as a trans person, you really have to hustle yourself. So to be a part of something where someones taking care of [production], its a huge gift.  Speed of Joy Productions Allie and her lesbian friends Lisa (Caroline Whitney Smith) and Kat (Fawzia Mirza). Her Story doesnt only depict trans womens experiences of themselves, but also how cisgender people deal with them. Its a show that doesnt sugarcoat the discrimination trans women often experience and it avoids the easy platitudes that often accompany sympathetic depictions of trans people written by cis people. The most cringe-inducing cis person in the show is Lisa (Caroline Whitney Smith), a lesbian friend of Allies who refuses to gender trans women using female pronouns and tells Paige that trans women should be banned from womens shelters. When Allie and Lisa fold laundry together with a couple of other lesbian friends, the group suspects Allie of having a crush on Vi. They then discuss the question of whether trans women can really be lesbians. Lisa argues that no one with a penis can be a lesbian. If a guy wants to throw on a skirt and call himself Veronica, thats fine, Lisa says. I mean, I dont think he has to chop his dick off. But I dont think I have to share a bathroom with him. This is when Allie finally gets up and leaves. Its the kind of scene that would be so much harder to do without transgender people involved; the line between perpetuating transphobia and confronting it is really thin. More than adroitly depicting trans womens points of view, Her Story also explores cis peoples reactions to trans women with enormous depth. When Paige goes out with a handsome guy named James (Christian Ochoa), she also has to navigate the possibility that her cis date might react to her negatively. You seem like a decent guy, so I want to put something on the table before we commit to a whole evening, Paige says. But when James continues to flirt with her, she takes a beat then backtracks, deciding not to reveal her trans status. While previous narratives like The Crying Game (1992) have privileged cisgender mens reactions to a trans womans revelation of her history, Her Story focuses on the much more psychologically complicated struggle trans women who pass for cis go through as they decide when to talk about their past. Her Story eschews the easy spectacle of trans revelation to explore the murkier emotional and ethical terrain of when exactly a trans woman should disclose her status and who should have the privilege of knowing. There were several instances where we definitely felt like we had a shorthand, talking to Jen or talking to Angelica about a situation, Freeland said about shooting these scenes. Freeland feels that being trans herself promoted the feeling of genuineness she desired as she directed Her Story, because she was able to discuss key moments with Richards and Ross to make sure they felt right based on their collective experiences.  View this image  Paige (Angelica Ross) has lunch with James (Christian Ochoa). Speed of Joy Productions Apart from writing and directing, Her Story also features trans women playing trans women, an imperative for the creators at a time when major trans roles have gone to cisgender people, like Eddie Redmayne in The Danish Girl and Jeffrey Tambor in Transparent. Society keeps telling people that trans women are really men. It encourages people to continue to do that when cis men keep playing trans womens roles, Richards said. Ross is also sensitive to the idea that there arent enough trans women who have the acting training to play themselves. Society frequently makes generalizations about our community without being really qualified, she said. Ross noted that there are many trans women who grew up studying drama and were only derailed by the difficulties of transition, which is also what happened to her. I cant waste my time complaining when I could be making space for what it is I want to see, Ross said. She emphasized that Her Story itself and her performance is her way of addressing the criticism that trans actors are not talented enough to play trans roles. The argument is now moot, Ross concluded. Theres already a vast sea of talent in our community. The creators hope that the creativity and talent evident in Her Story will attract media companies who will be interested in expanding the show into a full series. Ideally wed love to do something with Netflix, Amazon, or a similar service, Zak said. Our idea would be to treat what weve already shot as an independently produced pilot. What weve shot so far would amount to the first episode or the first couple of episodes. A real priority is mapping out what would happen if we got a full season, Richards said, in anticipation of the possibility that the series would get picked up. Im just brimming with excitement. Should Her Story get picked up and made into a full series, it would mark another major milestone in the development of trans stories on television, after the surprise feature film success of Tangerine last year. Even as Transparent has been lauded as a major step forward in representing trans characters on screen, and the ensemble show Sense8 features a significant and fully realized trans woman character, Her Story breaks barriers along a number of fronts by centering trans and queer womens perspectives, thanks to the creative talent of people whove lived the experiences the show depicts.

aS"The Education Departments Catherine Lhamon made the announcement in a letter to lawmakers obtained by BuzzFeed News. View this image  Getty Images for SiriusXM / Larry French Religious schools that receive federal money yet obtain federal exemptions to discriminate against LGBT students and employees will have their waivers posted online for public view, under a decision by the Department of Education. Announced in a letter to lawmakers that was obtained by BuzzFeed News, the decision comes one month after eight U.S. senators requested more transparency into the practice of granting school waivers from Title IX of the Education Act. The 1972 law bans publicly funded schools from engaging in sex-based discrimination which the Obama administration has applied to protect LGBT students but Congress also provided an exemption for religious schools. The assistant secretary for civil rights at the Education Department, Catherine Lhamon, told the senators on Wednesday that her office is planning to post the waiver requests and the governments reply letters on our website with a basic search tool so that applicants, students, parents, and others can be better informed about which educational institutions have sought and/or received a religious exemption. BuzzFeed News first reported on the full scope of the waiver trend in December including 60 religious universities have obtained a waiver under the Obama administration. Thats a sharp uptick from the two previous decades, when waivers concerned matters like allowing only men into seminary schools, abortion, pregnancy, or banning unmarried faculty. As of December, officials had never denied a schools request. Led by Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the lawmakers said in December, We are concerned these waivers allow for discrimination under the guise of religious freedom. They continued: At a very minimum, we believe that parents, students, and taxpayers have a right to know when institutions of higher education as recipients of tax dollars seek and receive exemptions under Title IX as well as the justification of those exemptions. In response, Lhamon wrote, I appreciate your suggestion the we provide more transparency about the religious exemption requests received and [the departments] responses. I agree. Lhamon added that both applications for the waivers and the governments replies will be posted online sometime in coming months as part of the departments broader push to increase transparency. Dorie Nolt, a department spokeswoman, did not put a finer point on that timeline, but she told BuzzFeed News officials were doing everything within their power to enforce discrimination bans. Nolt said in a statement, as Lhamon has said in the past, We are committed to protecting every student Congress gave us jurisdiction to protect, to the fullest extent of the law. Sen. Wyden issued a statement Wednesday calling the announcement a positive step toward greater transparency and accountability. The Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT advocacy group, also applauded the news. We have been alarmed by the growing trend of schools quietly seeking the right to discriminate against LGBT students, and not disclosing that information publicly, the organizations president, Chad Griffin, said in a statement. We believe that religious liberty is a bedrock principle of our nation, however, faith should never be used as a guise for discrimination. View this embed  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Britney Austin had alleged her employer used slurs, denied her access to the womens restroom, and refused to change her name on company records. View this image  The U.S. District Courthouse, Minneapolis, Minnesota. Getty Images / Hannah Foslien A national check-printing company will pay a transgender woman $115,000, plus issue her a personal apology and change its policies for transgender employees, under a settlement agreement approved by a federal judge in Minnesota on Wednesday. Under the consent decree, Deluxe Financial Services, Inc. denies that it violated Title VII or that it treated Britney Austin unlawfully, but has agreed to take several steps to improve the work climate for transgender employees. In 2011, Austin told her employers at Deluxes facility in Phoenix, Arizona, that she was transitioning to become a woman, which she alleged led managers and coworkers to use anti-transgender slurs and ban her from the restroom that corresponds with her gender identity. In addition, Austin alleged that the company refused to change her name on company records arguing that sex reassignment was required to change her name even though the company denied her health insurance coverage for transition-related care. When the company laid off employees at that location, which has since closed, Austin argued, the company denied her severance pay and COBRA benefits. Represented by private attorneys, Austin was backed in federal court by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency charged with investigating complaints of employment discrimination. In their court filings, the EEOC and Austin argued Deluxe illegally discriminated against her in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Austin also said the company denied her medically necessary care under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). While the settlement does not establish precedent in other cases, it reflects the EEOCs ongoing efforts to advance its 2012 decision finding that transgender discrimination is illegal as a form of sex discrimination under Title VII. While the decision is not binding on courts, it is binding on federal agencies and is being applied by the EEOC in its role investigating and seeking resolution of employment discrimination complaints. Even in states that lack a ban on transgender discrimination and despite the absence of federal law explicitly banning transgender discrimination, the settlement shows that there already can be consequences for employers who discriminate against transgender employees. We are extremely grateful to the EEOC for taking on this important case on behalf of our client and working side by side with us to achieve a settlement that marks yet another Title VII victory for transgender employees, Jillian T. Weiss, a private attorney who represented Austin along with attorney Ezra Young, told BuzzFeed News in a statement. In terms of the larger message, Weiss said, Discrimination against transgender employees is illegal under federal law everywhere in the United States. This case adds to the growing number of EEOC victories with the same conclusion. Beyond a cash settlement, the Minnesota-based company provides other concessions in the agreement. Among them, Deluxe agreed to remove all transgender exclusions in its health care plan and let transgender employees to use restrooms commensurate with their gender identity. In an apology to Austin, which was included with the settlement agreement, Deluxe Financial Services senior vice president of human resources Julie Loosbrock writes, We want to ensure you that we have made changes to our internal policies, including how we treat transgender employees requests to change biographical information or use a restroom commensurate with their gender identity. The apology continues: The company has changed its policies to ensure that transgender employees may use a restroom commensurate with their gender identity, that the company will promptly correct that employees sex designation and name in our internal records and systems, and that we will take hostile comments based on sex- stereotyping seriously, investigate them, and take prompt corrective and remedial action.

aS'Crispin Blunt has urged the government to reverse its plan to ban poppers. View this image  The Conservative MP for Reigate told fellow MPs he was speaking out in the hope of blocking a really foolish piece of policy becoming law. There are some times when something is proposed which becomes personal to you and you realise the government is about to do something fantastically stupid, said Blunt, who is gay. In those circumstances one has a duty to speak up. I use poppers. I out myself as a popper user and would be directly affected by this legislation, and I am astonished to find it is proposing to be banned so would very many other gay men. It simply serves to bring the whole law into disrepute, the 55-year-old MP added, warning that respect for the law is going to fly out of the window if a substance that people have been using for decades is suddenly banned. It is manifestly stupid to go down the path were going. Poppers is the common name for amyl nitrite, vials of which are easily available to purchase as room odourisers. They generate a brief high and are used as an aid for anal sex due to the drugs properties as a muscle relaxant. The government has proposed making the sale of poppers illegal as part of its Psychoactive Substances Bill, which imposes a near-blanket ban on all substances that have an affect on the brain, with exemptions for popular drugs such as alcohol and tobacco. Experts have previously said the broad definition of psychoactive substance used in the legislation could theoretically ban the smell of a bacon sandwich. Watch: Crispin Blunt says he uses poppers and calls plans to ban them "stupid". https://t.co/Q3tMjFN3ua Blunt was supported by fellow Conservative MP David Davis, who said he had spent the morning reading about [poppers] on the web and concluded they were not harmful but was concerned about the risk of blackmail to public figures who take poppers if they are made illegal. Labours Keith Vaz also urged the government to accept poppers do not pose a risk and should not be banned, and said the government had accepted they were beneficial in enabling anal sex. Another Conservative MP, Michael Fabricant, said he had also tried poppers but his bottom remains intact. I informed the Tea Room discussion on poppers that I had tried them, but that my bottom remains intacta. https://t.co/gTfgDB9Kj2 The law will be voted on this evening and Labour is backing an amendment that would ensure poppers would remain legal. Shadow minister Lyn Brown said the drug should be treated like nicotine, alcohol, and caffeine and fewer harms are likely to occur if it remains legal. However, she admitted she had little knowledge of poppers and had previously thought they were little things with string you have at parties. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"922,617       VIEWS Getting dumped can feel physically excruciating and this man has the data to back it up. View this image  The new Fitbit Blaze. David Mcnew/AFP / Getty Images A Fitbit can constantly track your steps, heart rate, and burned calories but in the process, it can also inadvertently capture life events, like heartbreak, as one Israeli man recently learned. Saturday started out like any other day for Koby Soto. Soto, 28, lives in Tel Aviv, Israel, where he is in the process of finishing up a law degree at Tel Aviv University. (Hes also the co-founder of Guesty, a Y Combinatorbacked startup that helps customers manage their Airbnbs and other rental properties.) On Saturday, he and his then-boyfriend of a few months, a fellow law student, were planning to take the night off from cramming for exams. View this image  Koby Soto Koby Soto / Via linkedin.com Then Soto got a call from his boyfriend. He said that were going to have to cancel, and I said Why? and he said, Things are not working as they should, Soto recalled in an interview with BuzzFeed News. I said, Are you serious? Youre doing this over the phone? That night, a sad and stunned Soto was venting to a friend, who told him to relax. Soto replied that he couldnt sleep or even study and as if to prove it, he opened his Fitbit app with the intent of sharing a screenshot of his heart rate at that moment. For the last five months, hes worn a Fitbit Charge HR, one of many gadgets with which he loves to quantify his life; he also owns an app-controlled lock, a Nest security camera, even a coffee machine programmed to boil a cup of java at the same time every day.  View this image  Koby Soto Soto usually looks at the app after gymnastics workouts, but most of the time, he says, he forgets that the device is quietly tracking his physiological signs around the clock. I wasnt doing anything, I didnt go to the gym, I didnt expect the Fitbit to even track me, he told BuzzFeed News. It was just on me. He doesnt see this as an intrusion, though. I feel like its nice to have a log of your confirmation of what you felt. You can tell people you have heartbreak and you feel bad, Soto said. People become less cynical once you show them the numbers or once you show the data or graphs. Everyone understands heartbreak, right? Everyones felt it. When you have this, its interesting you have something to show. As more and more people wear activity-tracking devices, theyre realizing what Soto did: Wearables dont only capture the data you think you want to capture, but also everything else that happens while youre wearing them. Last fall, a Massachusetts teen went to the doctor after getting a series of unusually high heart rate readings off his new Apple Watch and learned that they were signs of a potentially fatal muscle injury. Researchers are also giving wearables and smartphone apps to clinical trial participants so they can learn about how conditions like heart disease and asthma affect their everyday lives. A few days have passed since Sotos breakup, and hes trying to stay busy to keep the sadness at bay. There is one silver lining, though, since his screenshot shared on Twitter and Hacker News started garnering hundreds of likes and retweets. His heart rate, he said, is a little bit high.

David Bulmer-Rizzi died in tragic circumstances last Saturday after falling down a staircase and cracking his skull at the home of friends the couple were visiting. In Australia, where same-sex marriage is not legal, three jurisdictions do not recognise same-sex marriages performed overseas: South Australia, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory. View this image   He was also not regarded as the next of kin, meaning all decisions relating to Davids death had to be approved by Davids father, Nigel. Every single question I was asked whether or not I wanted David cremated, whether or not I wanted David to have a service, or be washed, even the cost of the coffin they were to use after I gave my answer, Davids father was consulted, he said. [Davids father] was also specifically asked, Do you want to look this over before its signed? It was outright discrimination. If I didnt get on with my in-laws I dont know that I would have any rights. @87cks @MarkDiStef legislation is being prepared to be out before the sa parliament this year We will introduce a raft of legislation to the parliament this year that will grapple with the more complex issues such as this. Last year, a report from the South Australian Law Reform Institute recommended that up to 14 pieces of legislation discriminating against LGBTI Australians be removed.When the report was released, Weatherill said his government would take action to address the discriminatory laws.

Croome called for federal reform on marriage, but noted recognition of same-sex marriages in South Australia as an interim measure. This case is a tragic example of how Australias marriage laws discriminate against gays and lesbians, causing needless pain, suffering and heartache, Wong told Buzzfeed News. Our sympathies go out to Mr Bulmer-Rizzi at this difficult time. Simms said Bulmer-Rizzi had been treated in a cruel and degrading way during his time of grief. Its an appalling situation, he said. We dont only deny the rights of couples to marry on Australian soil, we deny their right to be married overseas and that be recognised here. Surely common sense and compassion has to prevail. Simms said currently Australia has a complex web of relationship recognition, where some states recognise overseas same-sex marriages and others dont.

aS"Exclusive: Marco Bulmer-Rizzi will receive a new death certificate for his late husband after South Australian premier Jay Weatherill phoned him and promised to change the law. Marco Bulmer-Rizzi Getty Marco Bulmer-Rizzi and Jay Weatherill, the Premier of South Australia Jay Weatherill, the premier of South Australia, has personally telephoned Marco Bulmer-Rizzi, the British man whose husband died on honeymoon in Adelaide and whose marriage was not recognised, to apologise for what happened. Speaking to BuzzFeed News on Wednesday, Bulmer-Rizzi, who was told that his late husbands death certificate would read never married because South Australia does not accept overseas same-sex marriages, said Weatherill phoned me directly. We were on the phone for a good 10 minutes. He apologised. He said he would work on ways they can bring a change to avoid this happening in the future. Bulmer-Rizzi, 38, added: They are looking to actively change it through legislation and he told me it would happen in the next few months. He promised me that they would reissue the death certificate once that has happened. Bulmer-Rizzis husband, David Bulmer-Rizzi, 32, died suddenly last weekend after falling downstairs at the house they were staying at in Adelaide. The funeral director sought the approval of all death and funeral arrangements from Bulmer-Rizzis father-in-law, as Bulmer-Rizzi was not considered the next of kin. Weatherill promised to change the law so the state would recognise overseas marriage and to provide Bulmer-Rizzi with a new death certificate stating the correct marital status of the deceased. He wanted to know how I was and whether or not I received any other discrimination. We talked about the police, said Bulmer-Rizzi, explaining that one of the police officers kept referring to Bulmer-Rizzi as a partner rather than a husband. We discussed the support we had from the doctors and the transplant team. Bulmer-Rizzi donated his husbands organs to three people who have since had transplants. Asked how he felt about the call from Weatherill, Bulmer-Rizzi said: I thank him. I think its amazing. Its so much further than I ever thought last night when I was wondering what I could do. My mind is blown away that the premier of South Australia called to apologise. Its such an acknowledgment, coming from the top of the state. The reaction, both in Britain and across Australia, has been swift, with a huge outcry about what Bulmer-Rizzi has experienced, since he spoke on Tuesday to BuzzFeed News. View this image  Marco Bulmer-Rizzi Im overwhelmed, he said. Everybody has been calling. They include Rodney Croome, from Australian Marriage Equality, the countrys leading organisation campaigning for same-sex marriage. I just spent an hour on the phone with Rodney. Theyre starting a petition. That was quite emotional. Bulmer-Rizzi has also been inundated with messages from members of the Australian public, aghast at what they have heard. So many Australian straight people have been calling or sending me messages, he said, so the fact that both the people and the state are rallying around is incredible. Bulmer-Rizzi confirmed that he asked again if the original death certificate could be left blank but to no avail. I appreciate thats not possible, he said, adding that he also accepts that it will be several months before the new one is issued. In the midst of grief, he said, the international response has been incredibly heartening. Its almost a good day if it werent for everything else. After remaining composed on the phone to BuzzFeed News, Bulmer-Rizzi again broke down when speaking about his late husband. He probably would be proud, he said. I dont know if David would even believe it. The fact that through him maybe this is never going to happen to somebody else is such a good thing. 3.

aS"Mona Iraqi was previously sentenced to six months in jail for her role in sensationalizing the arrest of 26 men on charges of homosexuality. View this image  Facebook: MonaIraqiTv A Cairo appeals court overturned a judgement on Monday against Egyptian broadcaster in a defamation case brought for her role in publicizing the arrest of 26 men on charges of homosexuality from a bath house in December 2014, local media reported. The broadcaster, named Mona Iraqi, featured the bathhouse in a television program purporting to tell the whole story of the dens for spreading AIDS in Egypt that aired over the course of three nights following the raid. Iraqi claimed to have alerted police to gay sex parties being held in the bathhouse, and then posted pictures of the men being dragged naked from the bathhouse during the raid on her Facebook page. View this image  Facebook: MonaIraqiTv The arrests were the most high-profile in a crackdown on LGBT rights that began after President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi took power the previous year. Human rights advocates say more than 200 people have been arrested in widely publicized the sweeps that began after Sisi ousted a Muslim Brotherhood president from office with help from the military. Human rights advocates were stunned when it acquitted the 26 men in a trial last January; no Egyptian court has ever acquitted men accused of homosexuality in a high profile case. This was a stunning rebuke for Iraqi, who was condemned for her role in the raids even by editors at outlets that also have also sensationalized anti-LGBT arrests. Before Mondays ruling, Iraqi was facing six months in jail and a fine equal to about $1,300 after a lower court found her guilty of defamation last November. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS'612,207       VIEWS Exclusive: Marco Bulmer-Rizzi told BuzzFeed News about the outright discrimination that denied him next-of-kin status following his husbands death last week and the pain of the death certificate that read never married. View this image  David (left) and Marco Bulmer-Rizzi, the day before the accident Marco Bulmer-Rizzis voice is quiet and steady on the phone from Australia as he tries to stay composed to explain what has happened, the magnitude of what he has lost, and the sense of injustice he feels. Last Saturday, while on honeymoon in Adelaide, South Australia, his new husband, David Bulmer-Rizzi, 32, died suddenly after falling down a staircase and cracking his skull at the home of the friends they were visiting. Both were British citizens, but because same-sex marriage is not recognised in Australia, and in the state of South Australia even same-sex marriages from overseas are not legally recognised, Bulmer-Rizzi, 38, was told his husbands death certificate would state two words under the deceaseds marital status: never married. And because Bulmer-Rizzi is therefore not recognised as the next of kin, all the decisions surrounding his husbands death have had to be approved by his father-in-law, Nigel Bulmer. Also speaking to BuzzFeed News, Bulmer, 60, said: Its degrading. It demeans my sons memory and denies their relationship. Its cast them as second-class citizens. No one should ever have to go through what weve gone through. Were at the bottom and somebody has dug a deeper pit. Grieving for his husband but determined to speak out about what has happened, Bulmer-Rizzi called on the British government to intervene, because, he said, in the eyes of the Australian government, Im nothing. View this image  The Bulmer-Rizzis at the wedding ceremony in Santorini, 2015. After five years together, they married in June 2015 in Wandsworth, south London, with just witnesses present, before enjoying a full ceremony in Santorini, Greece, in front of their families and friends. After arriving in Australia in late December for their honeymoon, the Bulmer-Rizzis, who lived in Sunderland, travelled around the country before their final stop last week: Adelaide. I went to bed and David was to follow me shortly, said Bulmer-Rizzi. He was just reading his Kindle. I woke up 45 minutes later and heard this awful noise, and I turned on the light and he was lying at the bottom of the stairs in a bloodbath. Bulmer-Rizzi, who works in e-learning, does not know exactly what happened, except that the house was unfamiliar to his husband, a charity worker, and that it was dark. An ambulance arrived. There were four paramedics on the scene for about an hour trying to attend to him. They put him in an induced coma to avoid further injury. Then they took him to hospital, where I was warned it was critical and that if I needed to phone family that wanted to fly to Australia it was probably appropriate. Bulmer-Rizzi contacted his husbands parents, who flew out immediately. But a scan revealed the extent of the internal damage: a cracked skull and severe swelling of the brain. Surgery to release some of the pressure on the brain proved futile. Bulmer-Rizzi was taken into the intensive care unit to see his husband, who was lying unconscious. I was told he will die within 24 hours. There was nothing they could do. A few months earlier David Bulmer-Rizzi had discovered while being diagnosed with a rare kidney condition that he only had one kidney and was told he would need dialysis and a transplant later in life. This was very much in my mind so at that point I told the doctor that if he died I wanted to donate all his organs. By the following day last Friday Bulmer-Rizzi received the news that his husband was brain-dead. The police arrived to take statements, routine in a sudden death. The organ transplant procedure went ahead his heart, liver, and pancreas were donated to three separate people and David Bulmer-Rizzi died the following day. View this image  When the funeral director came, thats when I was told that because Australia doesnt recognise same-sex marriage, it [the death certificate] will say never married, said Bulmer-Rizzi. I asked at that point whether it was possible to say nothing [about his marital status], and I was told, No, thats not one of the drop-down options on the computer. I couldnt refuse. There was nothing I could have done. They wouldnt say married. They wouldnt leave it blank. They would only say never married. This was confirmed by email, because we complained afterwards. Bulmer-Rizzi also contacted the British consulate to protest. He read the response to BuzzFeed News: As you are aware, legislation differs from state to state and South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territories do not recognise overseas same-sex marriage and as such when registering death the local authority cannot state the deceased as married. I am sorry that this is the case. The funeral director proceeded to fill out the necessary forms to prepare the arrangements. I was completely overlooked, said Bulmer-Rizzi. I wasnt the next of kin. Every single question I was asked whether or not I wanted David cremated, whether or not I wanted David to have a service, or be washed, even the cost of the coffin they were to use after I gave my answer, Davids father was consulted. He was also specifically asked, Do you want to look this over before its signed? It was outright discrimination. If I didnt get on with my in-laws I dont know that I would have any rights. This consultation with his husbands father took place, said Bulmer-Rizzi, despite Nigel Bulmer stepping in. The first thing Davids father said to them was, Marco is Davids husband. He is the one [to make these decisions]. He said they shouldnt talk to him but they kept doing it. It was, he added, outright discrimination: Is it my belief that if Davids father objected to anything I said they would have had issues with what I said? Yes. Bulmer-Rizzi has written to David Cameron, the Foreign Office, and three MPs urging them to step in. I understand they cant change Australian law, he said, but Im not asking them to. Im asking my own country to stand by its own laws. If the British government is aware that other countries do not recognise same-sex marriage they should try to defend what their law says. Compounding the situation is the place of Bulmer-Rizzis death. Bulmer-Rizzi conveys the Foreign Office guidance about deaths while overseas: Normally, if you die abroad you can register the death at the British consulate and get a UK-style death certificate; however, Australia is expressly excluded. Yet if his husband had died just 200 miles east, in New South Wales, which does recognise overseas same-sex marriage, Bulmer-Rizzi would not be facing his current predicament. The death certificate would recognise that they were married and Bulmer-Rizzi would not be asking the British government to issue a new one. They [the UK government] should give me an accompanying document that says under the British law I am the next of kin. When asked to describe his husband, Bulmer-Rizzi broke down and began to read messages sent to him by friends depicting their loved one. David was incredible: passionate, honest, caring, and loved to fight for justice. He had a heart of gold. View this image  The only consolation for Bulmer-Rizzi has been the outcome of the organ donation. This morning we had a visit from our organ transplant coordinator and we now know Davids organs had gone to a 40-year-old man with two kids and another person who had been on the organ transplant list for 1,250 days. He added: Davids life gave this gift to three other people, three families who are rejoicing. Theres two children who have their daddy, who wont wake up tomorrow and think about whether or not David was gay. That person will wake up knowing they have a chance and can see their kids grow up. Bulmer-Rizzi added that his husband will be cremated so he can keep the remains with him when they finally travel home. His father-in-law is equally outraged by what has happened. I didnt think I could be hurt any deeper than I have been, Nigel Bulmer said. I flew out here to support my son-in-law. Im a 60-year-old man, Ive been in the fire brigade for many years, I thought was shockproof. But I was horrified and deeply hurt by the words I heard there: that theyre going to put on the death certificate never married. Its not acceptable. Its also not true. I was there. The legislature needs sorting out. This should be brought into public awareness. BuzzFeed News has contacted the Foreign Office but at the time of publication no response had been supplied. UPDATE Following the release of this story, South Australian premier Jay Weatherill announced he would introduce legislation to recognise overseas same-sex marriages to state parliament by the end of the year. He also apologised to the family for the hurt caused by the law.

aS"Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois told BuzzFeed News that discrimination on the basis of being gay is illegal in his state and should be against the law nationwide. View this image  AP / Nam Y. Huh Mark Kirk of Illinois became the first U.S. Republican senator to co-sponsor the Equality Act on Tuesday, turning the LGBT anti-discrimination bill into a bipartisan effort in both chambers of Congress. Discrimination on the basis of being gay is against the law in Illinois and should be against the law nationwide, Kirk told BuzzFeed News. Kirk has been outspoken among Republicans for marriage equality and LGBT protections, but he did not elaborate on why he signed on to the bill six months after it was introduced. Still, Kirks comment gives insight to tensions faced by lawmakers who represent states that ban LGBT discrimination but belong to a political party that has historically opposed LGBT-rights laws. The Equality Act would bar discrimination against people on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity by expanding a band of civil rights laws which already protect individuals on the basis of race, religion, and national origin. If passed by a future Congress, it would be the most comprehensive federal policy to protect LGBT rights in housing, workplaces, schools, public accommodations, financial institutions, and other settings. The measure is unlikely to pass in the current Republican-dominated Congress, but Sen. Jeff Merkley, lead sponsor of the Senate bill, lauded support from across the aisle. In communities across America, Republicans and Democrats alike share a common belief that discriminating against someone just because of who they are is fundamentally wrong, he told BuzzFeed News. It is time for all Americans to work together to end long-standing discrimination against the LGBT community. Democrats also got a boost in the House last week when Rep. Robert Dold, also from Illinois, announced he would co-sponsor the House version of the Equality Act. Dold was the bills the first Republican co-sponsor in Congress. The House version is sponsored by Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Since entering the political spotlight, Greg Gianforte has avoided questions about social issues. But he has personally lobbied against an LGBT rights bill, and tax documents show his foundation has given more than $1.1 million to leading organizations that oppose LGBT rights. View this image  Bloomberg / Getty Images / David Paul Morris Last September, one month after filing preliminary paperwork to run for governor, Greg Gianforte moderated a panel at the Montana High Tech Jobs Summit. A man in the audience had a question: Would passing a religious freedom law like the one in Indiana, which critics said would permit LGBT discrimination, affect Montana businesses? Gianforte turned to the panelists, and after the president of one local business said the issue was not on our radar, Gianforte shut down the subject. Thank you, he said abruptly. Next question. It was a surprising silence from Gianforte, given his history of advocacy on this very issue. The entrepreneur became wealthy by growing his company, RightNow Technologies, in the city of Bozeman and selling it to Oracle for $1.5 billion. For years, he was quietly one of the states leading financiers of organizations that advocate for religious freedom laws and oppose LGBT nondiscrimination policies. Public records obtained by BuzzFeed News also show Gianforte lobbied city officials in Bozeman to block an LGBT nondiscrimination ordinance, arguing that a ban on discrimination could drive away business. But since he stepped into the political spotlight, the 54-year-old Christian has positioned himself as a strictly economic-oriented candidate who will create jobs, and has ducked questions about his positions on LGBT rights and how his religious beliefs would affect his policies as governor. His campaign has raised more than $300,000 since filing an exploratory committee in August. And when he formally announces his candidacy, which he is expected to do Wednesday, he will cement his status as the states Republican frontrunner. But records show a man who has a long history of using religious arguments to push an extreme social agenda. A BuzzFeed News examination of tax returns shows his foundation, the Gianforte Family Charitable Trust, donated more than $1.1 million over a period of six years to some of the political groups leading the charge against LGBT rights in the United States. Tax records list the trustees as Gianforte; his wife, Susan; and son Richard. On balance, he has given far more money to Christian missionaries and faith-based schools than to advocacy groups. But when the donations were political in nature, they were overwhelmingly to organizations that focus on opposing womens reproductive rights and blocking LGBT equality. The spokesperson for one recipient, the Family Research Council, on MSNBC in 2010 said that homosexual behavior should be punished by criminal sanctions. Another group, Focus on the Family, still advocates a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex couples from marrying. And an organization in his home state, the Montana Family Foundation, received more than half a million dollars from Gianforte between 2008 and 2012, when the group functioned as the states primary advocate against LGBT policies. This wasnt just a passing issue, Kim Abbot, co-director of the Montana Human Rights Network, told BuzzFeed News. Hes an activist. Hes been putting money into these issues for years. I think gay people in Montana have to assume that if Gianforte were elected governor, there would be a rollback of protections under his authority, she added. But until recently, she said, I think he politically flew under the radar. Gianforte did not respond to requests to comment for this article on his donations to anti-LGBT groups, what he would do if elected, or his own direct activism. In his personal capacity, Gianforte was on the front line pushing against an LGBT nondiscrimination ordinance in his hometown of Bozeman. Public records and interviews conducted by BuzzFeed News show he met commissioners one-on-one, and, when an ordinance appeared likely to pass anyway, he submitted drafts of new versions of the bill. He successfully pressed to weaken the measure so that certain religious employers may be able raise a defense if they turn away LGBT employees or job applicants. Political watchers in Montana believe this history could play a key factor in the election if it becomes a central issue, which Gianforte is apparently trying to avoid. Gianforte is presenting himself as an economic conservative; he is talking about jobs, Robert Saldin, a political science professor at the University of Montana, told BuzzFeed News. And that message is very much in line which what has been successful for Montana Republicans. I think he is little bit of an unknown quantity in political circles, Saldin added. Selling his company to Oracle has made him incredibly wealthy thats what people know and his donations are really interesting. Its quite admirable how much money he has given away. But, he pointed out, People are out to take him down as an out-of-touch evangelical guy who is going to take away your rights, and if that message sticks, thats a real problem for him, because people are into their rights out here. The mountainous state is reliably conservative, but less divided on social issues than much of the South and Midwest, Saldin said. The Democratic incumbent, Steve Bullock, won in 2012 as an anti-tax moderate, a natural fit for an electorate that tends to prefer frugally minded candidates over social demagogues from either party. Some of Gianfortes other religious beliefs have also raised questions. Among his philanthropy, Gianforte gave the the Foundation Advancing Creation Truth a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton for its Glendive Dinosaur and Fossil Museum. The museum claims the Earth was created by God in six natural days, asks if humans walked with dinosaurs, and professes that God ordained marriage between only man and woman. MT needs more thriving businesses like Woods Power-Grip in Laurel. #MTpol #MTgov In a December Politico interview, Gianforte was asked why Democrats seem to be eager to paint you as religious kook and whether he was interested in rolling back gay marriage. Im very clear, he responded. Im a Christian. My faith in God is very important to me. Im running because were 49th in the county in wages, and were going to focus on the economy. He added, Were going to create better opportunities for people. He ducked again in December when the Associated Press asked him about how religion would influence his politics. The focus is on jobs, he said, thats what people want to talk about. But if Gianforte is establishing a firewall between his faith and economic politics if elected governor, thats a departure from his positioning in the past that opposing LGBT rights law was good for business. Its an issue he is not comfortable talking about, but we are very comfortable talking about it, Jason Pitt, a spokesperson for the Montana Democratic Party, told BuzzFeed News. He said Democrats are trying to frame the race around Gianfortes history on social views in part because it will turn off voters and also because they believe Gianforte has tried to dodge the issue. Gianforte is one of the most anti-LGBT candidates that Montana has ever seen, Pitt said. We think it is important for Montana voters to know his background. Pitt also contends that Gianfortes views on LGBT laws and talk about jobs are inherently linked. I dont think there is a way you can separate them, Pitt argued. You cant say you are a job creator and then support job-killing discrimination laws. In January 2014, Gianforte sent a volley of emails to Bozeman city commissioners and the mayor about his concern over legislation to ban LGBT discrimination in housing, jobs, and employment. He requested meetings over coffee with them individually, starting a months-long lobbying effort. The exchanges were obtained through a records request by a local activist and provided to BuzzFeed News. Hes a very nice guy, easy to talk to, Carson Taylor, the current Bozeman mayor who was then a commissioner, told BuzzFeed News in an interview. The two met at the Leaf and Bean on Main Street. He wanted to work with us to get what he wanted, instead of outright opposition to it. Gianforte pressed the commission to abstain from the ordinance that would allow LGBT people legal recourse if they were discriminated against, according to emails to city lawmakers. Gianforte argued that the city should entertain a nonbinding resolution, because passing a binding ordinance would discourage Christian-owned businesses from moving to Bozeman. Homosexual advocates try to argue that businesses are leery of locating in towns that arent friendly to homosexuals. I believe the opposite is truer, he wrote in a Jan. 23 email to the commissioners and mayor. Gianforte continued: I would argue that Christian businesses will carefully evaluate where they would be subject to an ordinance like this before locating. To include even locating just outside city limits to avoid having to compromise their religious beliefs. He warned of other consequences, too, saying that banning transgender discrimination would let men to sexually prey on girls in bathrooms a common argument from anti-LGBT activists. As the bill proceeded through the commission, Gianfortes language and tactics grew stronger. He worked with lawyers at the Alliance Defending Freedom, a group his foundation gave $58,500 to, in order to propose language that would give religious businesses or organizations a defense if they discriminated in employment and public accommodations due to their faith. Mayor Taylor said that Gianforte was the only activist to provide unsolicited legislation and amendments on the nondiscrimination ordinance. Gianfortes emails also show him saying he opposes discrimination, in general, and that he was simply seeking to balance rights of LGBT people and religious people. Taylor told BuzzFeed News that Gianforte hires employees with a different faith and background of his own. But Taylor also noted that Gianforte also lobbied for a religious freedom ordinance that would, for example, allow a baker to refuse a same-sex couple ordering a wedding cake. In the end, Taylor said the commission included some religious exemptions to the law, more narrow than anything Gianforte requested. On the issue of the economic impact, however, Taylor rejects Gianfortes argument that the ordinance passing in spring 2014 would be bad for business. I would say the city is booming right now, the mayor said. If anything, the nondiscrimination ordinance encouraged people to want to move here and work here. The Gianforte family foundations annual tax forms some posted online and others provided to BuzzFeed News by a source show the largest recipients from 2008 to 2013 are Christian schools. Among the recipients with a clear political agenda, the groups range from radical to relatively mainstream. Probably the best known national organization, Focus on the Family, says marriage between a man and woman is a top priority, has long opposed nondiscrimination ordinances, and argues that businesses open to the public should be allowed to turn away LGBT people for religious reasons. Another recipient is the Alliance Defending Freedom, one of the countrys leading legal organizations that litigates cases to allow religiously based refusals of service and supports religious freedom legislation. The furthest to the right, the Family Research Council, has been identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group. Abbot, of the Montana Human Rights Network, is particularly concerned with Gianfortes giving within the state. Gianforte gave to the Montana Family Foundation, which Abbot calls the states primary opponent of LGBT rights in fights from school boards to the legislature. Of the half million dollars granted over a six-year period, $280,000 was in 2012 more than half of the groups $476,000 annual budget that year, according to tax records. But as Montana Cowgirl Blog reported last year, Gianfortes ties to the group were scrubbed from Gianfortes Wikipedia page in 2014. Someone removed mention that his wife was also the Montana Family Foundations board chair and nixed language about how his donations make up a substantial chunk of the groups operating budget. Abbot said she worries that, if elected, Gianforte would try to repeal the states limited LGBT protections. One of those policies, for example, was signed by Gov. Bullock on Monday. Although Montana lacks a statewide law banning LGBT discrimination, a 2008 executive order bans discrimination against state employees on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Gov. Bullock has now expanded those rules to state contractors and subcontractors a move that could be undone by the next governor. Below is a summary of the Gianforte foundations giving to groups that oppose LGBT nondiscrimination laws, same-sex marriage, and other rights for LGBT people. They are taken from the Gianforte Family Charitable Trusts tax filings from 2008 to 2013. Montana Family Foundation: $518,357 Focus on the Family: $510,000 Alliance Defending Freedom $58,500 New Jersey Family Policy Council: $37,500 Family Research Council: $14,000. California Family Council: $10,000 Heritage Foundation: $7,000 American Center for Law and Justice: $3,000 Focus on the Family and the Family Research Council declined to answer questions about their financial relationship with Gianforte or his potential governor. Alliance Defending Freedom said it would examine donation records but did not reply to a request for comment by press time. Jeff Laszloffy, president of the Montana Family Foundation, also declined to talk about Gianfortes run or donations. But he added in an email, Please note that Susan Gianforte stepped off of our board some time ago, prior to Greg Gianforte announcing his formation of an exploratory committee. That seems to show the Gianfortes stepping away from groups invested in LGBT policies as Greg Gianforte approached a political run. But that does not settle questions about how he would approach LGBT rights if elected. It is a legitimate issue, said Saldin, the political science professor. Gianforte is talking about jobs, but hes really put some money behind these views, he said. So when it comes to LGBT issues and abortion, what are his views? And what happens when the law is in conflict with his own personal beliefs? What would he do in a situation like that? He hasnt addressed much of that. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"When trans and gender-nonconforming people arent recognized in the social and medical conversations around periods, their specific experiences are overlooked and their access to adequate gynecological healthcare is jeopardized. View this image  Kiersten Essenpreis for BuzzFeed News Everyone with a uterus tends to have a complicated relationship with their period. Theres the bloody mess that can ruin a favorite pair of underwear; the shooting abdominal pain and uterine cramps; the often unwelcome whirlwind of emotions. For some, menstruation connects them either physically or spiritually to their bodies, while others consider their periods a monthly nuisance to battle through as gracefully as possible. For many trans and gender-nonconforming people, however, there can be a whole other layer of discomfort during that time of the month: dysphoria. Jessie Devine, a 23-year-old genderqueer writer and martial artist, tells BuzzFeed News that while on his period, Things are happening around me and Im not really a part of it [] when people are talking to me, theyre really talking to a girl whos not really there. Devine is one of many people who, during menstruation, suffers from feelings of loss and detachment when their bodily functions dont match up with their gender identity. Amy Leverington, a 27-year-old agender person, experiences something similar. Theres this overwhelming sense of [my period] not being right, that its not part of my body that its not coming from my body, and its something that shouldnt be happening to me, they say. Frank Ly, who is genderqueer, also has a complicated relationship with their period: I feel quite conflicted about it, because it is responsible for making me both feel like myself, yet feel less like the person I want to be. Menstruation, a fact of life for half the human population, has long since been considered taboo in polite society billions of people have periods, but no one is supposed to talk about them. Over the past year, conversations surrounding the destigmatization of menstruation have reached fever pitch. At the Australian Open in January 2015, tennis player Heather Watson blamed her mediocre performance on her period, saying, I think its just one of those things that I have, girl things. Later, in March 2015, Instagram notoriously deleted a womans period photos, after which the woman responded: I will not apologize for not feeding the ego and pride of misogynist society. But even as cisgender women have started speaking up about the facts of their bodies, transgender and gender-nonconforming people have been boxed out of the conversation particularly because, in popular feminist discourse and medical practices alike, menstruation is so heavily equated with the female body and womens health. Trans exclusion is all the more egregious here when considering that the needs of trans people so often go unmet in a health care system that can be oblivious to their existence. For many medical professionals, someone with a uterus is a woman in their eyes. Health care providers often use sex and gender interchangeably, according to a 2015 study in the Journal of Emergency Nursing. The conflation might begin as early as medical school. Elizabeth Sekera, RN and clinical director of Lyon-Martin Health Services in San Francisco, tells BuzzFeed News that oftentimes medical schools provide electives for trans care, but they are not required courses in the actual curricula. I think many providers dont educate themselves once they are in practice because seeing patients is complicated and there is always an incredibly large amount [to] learn, she says. What a provider needs to do is understand the issues the trans community is facing, and [decide] that is a priority. Since many medical providers arent well-versed in trans issues, trans and gender-nonconforming people often bear the burden of educating their health care providers about gender identity. I get misgendered all the time by doctors, says Devine. Even at a clinic thats supposed to be the transgender health care clinic, people arent educated. Even though theyre supposed to be, and even though theres a space for pronoun preference on the intake form. Theyre stuck in a binary method of thought. Its gynecological care in particular that gets complicated. As a remedy for dysphoria resulting from bodily functions like menstruation, Courey E, 34, whos nonbinary, tried to find a doctor who would perform an endometrial ablation which reduces or fully prevents uterine bleeding or a hysterectomy. I have attempted to try to find a gyno that will remove my uterus, but without a problem it seems like they wont, they say. If I say that its for gender-related reasons, insurance will not pay for it and it is prohibitively expensive. A hysterectomy often costs somewhere between $7,000 to $12,000. According to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), most health insurance plans do not cover gender affirmation surgery. Courey is not alone in this battle. Megan Knouff, who is nonbinary, is also adamant about having a hysterectomy done. I think there is that paternalistic idea of Well, you will change your mind someday, says Knouff. Terry, 26, whos genderqueer, is another person who has no intention of procreating and is seeking someone to perform the surgery. Im still trying to figure out a way to convince a doctor that yeah, I have a uterus, but no way in hell am I ever going to use it. Dr. Cecile Unger, a pelvic reconstructive surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic, is part of a multidisciplinary team that treats transgender patients. Unger frequently performs hysterectomies on people who are in their twenties or younger. The reason some GYNs are reluctant to perform hysterectomies on patients at such a young age is because of the risk of regret in the future, Unger tells BuzzFeed News. Patients need to understand that they will not be able to carry their own biological children if they have a hysterectomy. The other important consideration is the effect this may have on bone health in such young patients. They need to remain on their cross-sex hormones, vitamin D, and calcium to avoid detrimental effects to their bones from not having estrogen. These are important considerations, and providers may shy away from performing surgery because of the importance of these factors. Even if Courey or Knouff found a health care provider who would perform a hysterectomy, that medical clinic might be many miles away from their homes. Quite a few of Ungers patients do not live close to the Cleveland Clinic, but they come to her because they have been denied elsewhere. Not every trans or gender-nonconforming person is uncomfortable with their uterus, however. Many feel right at home in their bodies. But even those who dont experience dysphoria come up against difficulties in the health care system, particularly when it comes to gynecology. I know a trans man whose insurance refused to cover a pap test because his ID said male, Devine tells BuzzFeed News. How can a trans man, in the aforementioned example, take care of himself if insurance refuses to see him for who he is? I dont know why this is a revolutionary idea, he added, but health care needs to care for someones body AND mind, even when those two things dont match by commonly accepted standards. Many trans people, nonbinary people especially, feel like our bodies are fine. Its the public perception of our bodies thats messed up. Public perception makes all the difference. According to Transfaith, a transgender faith and spirituality organization, 36% of nonbinary people have refused to seek health care out of fear of facing discrimination. Sekera, the RN in San Francisco, tells BuzzFeed News that sometimes providers will flat-out refuse to provide care or will act aggressively toward a patient because of that persons gender identity. Even if a patient is able to find a competent provider, Sekera says, trans and gender-nonconforming people often then face having to fight to have their medical needs covered by their insurance. In order for a trans person to be prescribed hormone replacement therapy (HRT), for example, they oftentimes must first must be diagnosed with gender identity disorder, which many trans people feel reduces their gender identities as a whole rather than just the symptoms of dysphoria to a disease that needs curing. Gender essentialism not only permeates the medical world, but also the social/activist realms, where destigmatizing periods has long been a feminist goal. Last October, the rapper T.I. said in an interview that he didnt want to vote for Hillary Clinton because of womens tendencies to make rash decisions emotionally. Last August, after the Republican debate, Donald Trump tried to dismiss Megyn Kellys questioning by saying, There was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever. Although Trump later said that he meant her nose, the damage was already done and the stigma around periods reappeared once again in the public forum. But as our society is working toward calling out and eventually destigmatizing period-shaming, that destigmatization doesnt extend to everyone. Historically speaking, feminism has not always welcomed trans people with open arms and plenty of subsets still dont. During second-wave feminism in the 1970s and 1980s, icons such as Gloria Steinem believed that transgender people were atypical and did not belong in the movement (although she has since changed her stance). But many feminist thinkers are still adamantly trans-exclusionary. In a New York Times opinion piece, Elinor Burkett expressed her discomfort with Caitlyn Jenner, who she believes cheapens the idea of what it means to be a woman. She, like many others, believes that trans women cannot be included in feminist conversations, since they have not been shamed or harmed for their female-born bodies. In demeaning the experience of trans women, trans-exclusionary feminists neglect the experiences of other people assigned female at birth who dont identify as women and yet have experienced shame and violation for their bodies all the same arguably, in many instances, even more so than cis women. The experiences of those who have been left out of the national menstruation conversation are finally starting to get some attention. In summer 2014, New Yorkbased underwear company Thinx created the tagline Underwear for Women With Periods, which was met with a lot of backlash. Thinx co-founder Miki Agrawal tells BuzzFeed News he received tons of emails from those who urged the company to be more inclusive. In November 2015, Thinx created a line of period underwear for trans men. A year earlier, in 2014, came the launch of a gender-neutral menstruation calculator app called Clue. And while medical institutions still have a long way to go, the University of Pennsylvania, as well as a few other schools around the country, launched programs in 2014 to improve the health of LGBT people. While anyone of any gender who menstruates can establish a rapport over mood swings, blood flow, and exhaustion, trans and gender-nonconforming people have specific needs around menstruation that often go unheeded. Only when we take the steps to hear others stories about the violence both covert and overt that they experience due to their periods will we be able to truly begin transforming public perception.

aS"I wouldnt say its a desert out there, but theres still not enough. View this image  PR Image / Subject to Change Soaps like Home and Away and Neighbours have been a staple on Australian television for decades. Now, a groundbreaking new drama with LGBT teens at the forefront is hoping to find a home among the gum trees. With a fresh Aussie cast, strong community backing, and a pilot launched on YouTube just last week, Subject to Change has picked up fans already. But now, its creators are looking for a network or streaming service to back the show and bring episode two to life. Fundamentally, Subject to Change is about the trials and tribulations of high school. It stars three unlikely best friends: neat freak Ben (Aiden Debono), who likes guys, but cant tell anyone; obnoxious, tomboyish Karly (Maryann Wright), obsessed with soccer and music; and Evie (Katy Avery) who is caught up with body image, bullying, and boys. Theyre just normal teenagers at a normal school. But Subject to Change hopes to tell the stories of LGBT teenagers in Australia in a way that hasnt been done before.  View this image  The three leads in Subject to Change: Aiden Debono, Katy Avery, Maryann Wright (clockwise from right). PR Image / Subject to Change Debono, Wright and Avery, along with the shows director Daniel Mercieca and producer Rory Delaney, are crowded around a cafe table on a rainy Sydney day, hot drinks in hand. The enthusiasm is palpable as they tell BuzzFeed News about Subject to Change. Theres something about the story that draws people in, even without it being pushed. its unlocked something, somewhere, says Wright. Since the pilot launched on YouTube last week quietly, says Delaney, without too much fanfare the cast has received messages from people across Australia and all over the world. Messages from London, Iran, Russia and France have all said it struck a chord. Part of the appeal comes from the shows mission: to counter a lack of depth in the LGBT characters we see on Australian television. There were always characters shows touched on, but it felt like they needed to be more central, to really get and explain and understand their side of things, Mercieca says. Delaney agrees, adding that more LGBT characters are coming through. He points to The Family Law, a new SBS show based on the popular memoir by Benjamin Law, as one example. I wouldnt say its a desert out there, but theres still not enough. In the works since 2001, Subject to Change came together slowly but surely, after a fundraising campaign exceeded its $15,500 target by an enormous 75%. The amount of support just blew our minds, the people who wanted to support the show financially, says Delaney. There was a period of just asking, how? says Avery. Its just us were not big names! Mercieca puts it down to there being a real gap in the market for young adult drama, adding that the extra money funded post-production and commercial music rights. Support came from high places as well, with musician Missy Higgins donating the rights to her song Secrets to be used in the pilot. View this image  Maryann Wright as Karly (L) and Katy Avery as Evie in the Subject to Change pilot. PR Image / Subject to Change Mercieca and Delaney drew from their own high school experiences and worked with the Safe Schools Coalition (an organisation that works to prevent LGBTI bullying in schools) to make Ben, Karly and Evie as authentic and relatable as possible. We did a few informal focus groups with high school students today, just to make sure we got a few contemporary things correct, says Delaney. But a lot of it was working off the characters, making sure they were real and believeable. When asked what they have in common with their characters, Wright and Debono simultaneously answer Everything! My character is pretty much me when I was that age, says Wright. I was a tomboy, I played soccer, and I sang. It was me. I literally walked into the audition and went, well, if I dont get cast, theres nothing more I can do. When Debono auditioned, he was a queer teenager at a Catholic high school living the same reality than Ben does. People yelling at me by lockers, trying to suppress who I am, he remembers. And of course I had crushes on boys. It was an all boys school, there were attractive people at my school! Now, Debono is in year twelve at a performing arts school, where things are friendlier but he says filming the pilot was a breath of fresh air for him during a difficult time. It allowed me to explore who I actually am, he says. I grew so much from the pilot. it changed my view of myself. View this image  James Ritchie as Ethan (L) and Aiden Debono as Ben in the Subject to Change pilot. PR Image / Subject to Change While the online response has been good, Delaney and Mercieca are in a continual process of pitching, hoping Subject to Change will be picked up by a TV network or a streaming service. Theres an audience out there for it, says Mercieca. The people with the money are always going to be cautious about what they spend it on. Its not because its gay content, theyre just being clever in how they commission their shows. The streaming services are more likely to take risks on what can be perceived as niche content, adds Delaney. An TV executive watches the show and thinks, Its an LGBT youth series, our bucket of money for that is only so big. But with Stan, Presto, Netflix thats all changing. Episode two is on hold until the show can be signed, but plenty of people are asking for it, says Wright. Theyre already invested in the characters. However, Mercieca and Delaney are tight-lipped about what the next episode and the rest of the season might contain, with even the three lead actors in the dark. But while Debono, Wright and Avery have their theories about where Ben, Karly and Evie might end up, its on the downlow for now, while Mercieca and Delaney continue pitching, hoping someone will pick it up. Weve had positive conversations with Screen Australia, says Delaney. Were waiting for it, adds Wright. We just need one yes. youtube.com Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"From Orange Is the New Blacks premiere date to Black Mirror casting! View this image  There were tons of announcements from Netflix at the Television Critics Association winter press tour in Pasadena, California, today as the streaming service unveiled its plan for the first half of 2016. From castings to premiere dates to first looks, here is everything you need to know about the shows you will Netflix and Chill with this year. At the end of Season 3, the future of Litchfield remained in doubt as the prison got a new inmate in the Martha Stewart-esque Judy King (Blair Brown). In Season 4, those two things converge in a wild and exciting way. Because [Season 3] ends with the overcrowding in the prison, you do push all the groups together and the alliances that happen are unexpected, Brown said of Season 4 at the TCA. That means some characters who have never interacted with one another will this season which elates not only the actors, but creator Jenji Kohan as well. Were always trying to make new combinations, she said. Its so exciting to watch these women perform [so] were trying to keep it interesting for ourselves too. Were always looking for that. While details on the season were in short supply from the notoriously tight-lipped crew, Samira Wiley, who plays Poussey, teased, I feel like weve got something really, really different than what weve put out before. View this image  After defeating Kilgrave (David Tennant), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter) will tackle a new foe in Season 2 of the acclaimed drama a fact executive producer Melissa Rosenberg said was intimidating and exciting in equal measure. And while the Jessica Jones writers room hasnt reassembled to tackle Season 2, given that the show is more grounded than Brian Michael Bendiss fantastical source material, chances are it will diverge a little bit more in the future. Although, Rosenberg was quick to add, I will always use as much as I can from the book.

Cox and Bernthal Patrick Harbron Yung Patrick Harbron Frank Castle aka The Punisher (Jon Bernthal) and Elektra (Elodie Yung) leap into the fray this season throwing Daredevil (Charlie Cox) for a loop. Frank Castle comes and really stirs the pot, executive producer Doug Petrie said. For me, so much of Season 1 was about Matt dealing with this decision to be a hero, Bernthal said. I think here comes this guy [and] hes really not concerned with being a hero. Yung added, Elektra is kind of a sociopath. This world is a game for her. Its like a chess game. What motivates her is what she wants, shell use anything she needs to use to get to her goal, and if she needs to kill people, she would. She has this coldness. As for whether or not fans will see Yung slip into Elektras iconic wardrobe, executive producer Marco Ramirez emphasized the shows grounded nature but also an awareness of what fans want to see. We want to make them feel as iconic and grounded as possible, he said. View this image  That 70s Show reunion alert!

aS"Taking Truvada every day to prevent HIV isnt any more dangerous than taking a daily aspirin to prevent heart attacks, a new study finds. View this image  Matejkotula / Getty Images / Via thinkstockphotos.com People who take Truvada, the once-a-day pill that prevents HIV, are no more at risk for dangerous side effects than those who take an aspirin a day to prevent heart attacks, according to a new study. Researchers compared Truvada and aspirin by looking at the drugs risk profiles in large, published studies. Although the two drugs come with distinct side effects Truvada most commonly causes dizziness, vomiting, and weight loss, whereas aspirin is most commonly associated with bleeding problems the frequency of side effects is roughly equivalent. But the drugs have very different reputations, among both doctors and the general public. Century-old aspirin, when taken as a preventative tool against heart attacks, is viewed as an everyday medication, no big deal. But Truvada, also known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (or PrEP), is a new pill, intertwined with the loaded issues of HIV and sex habits, and mired in uncertainty. Everyones got aspirin in their medicine cabinet, Jeffrey Klausner, professor of medicine and public health at the University of California, Los Angeles, and lead author of the study, told BuzzFeed News. But as a physician Ive seen people come into the hospital and die from aspirin overdoses people can be allergic. The side effects of each drug are markedly different, Klausner noted, and affect different organs. But after crunching the numbers, he said, it really looked like I could say Truvada compared favorably, in terms of its safety profile, to aspirin. An estimated 52% of American adults aged 45 to 75 are prescribed a daily aspirin to prevent cardiovascular and gastrointestinal diseases, including heart attacks and cancer. Truvada, which was approved by the FDA in 2012, has been shown to have roughly 92% efficacy in preventing transmission of HIV. The CDC estimates that about 1.2 million Americans are at high enough risk for contracting HIV that they should be prescribed the drug. But only about 21,000 currently get it. According to Klausner, who trains doctors around the country on how to treat and prevent HIV, much of this has to do with ambivalence about prescribing otherwise healthy individuals a daily pill. A lot of the concerns I hear from providers are about safety, Klausner said. There have been continued voices saying, Wouldnt it just be better if people used condoms, or reduced their number of partners? Those are important strategies, but they dont work for everyone. The issue of doctor awareness about PrEP is one of the biggest barriers to its wider use. The new study is an interesting thought experiment, Dawn Smith of the CDCs Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, told BuzzFeed News. But, she added, Im not sure it addresses the safety concerns that some clinicians have. Smith noted a CDC study showing that in 2015, about one-third of primary care doctors and nurses had never heard of Truvada. Beyond the lack of awareness, she said, doctors dont want to cause any side effects, no matter how minor, in otherwise healthy patients. In his analysis, Klausner looked at the NNH or number needed to harm meaning the number of people who take the drug before one person experiences a harmful side effect. The NNH for Truvada in gay men or transgender women was 114 for nausea and 96 for unintentional weight loss. In women, side effects appeared more frequently, with 1 in 56 women experiencing nausea, 1 in 41 vomiting, and 1 in 36 mildly elevated liver enzymes. Rarer adverse events for Truvada include kidney problems and a small decrease in bone mineral density, but Klausner notes that both of those effects have been shown to be reversible once the medication is discontinued. In contrast, aspirin had an NNH of 15 for bleeding problems and 20 for easy bruising. Rarer problems included ulcers and other gastrointestinal problems. Because its so much older, aspirin has been tested in many more people with many more years of follow-up, Klausner noted. Because Truvada is a relatively new drug, it will take awhile to accrue the data needed to make its long-term safety bulletproof. In the meantime, however, Klausner hopes more doctors will educate themselves about the HIV prevention drug. And after that, he said, we should work to make it the same price as aspirin. 2.

aS"Exclusive: Calum McSwiggan told BuzzFeed News what drove him to appear in X-rated videos and why hes embarrassed that they featured unprotected sex. I want it to serve as a warning. View this image  Joe Newman / SWNS for BuzzFeed You should always, always use a condom, says LGBT YouTube star and sexual health campaigner Calum McSwiggan in a recent video for an HIV charity. It is understandable then that today McSwiggan is feeling more than a little bit embarrassed as he tells BuzzFeed News about a secret hes been hiding for six years: He used to do bareback porn. For months, rumours to this effect have been swirling online. Threats have been made to expose him it is, after all, a revelation at marked odds with his wholesome image. So the 25-year-old, whose influence on young LGBT people is such that he is courted by numerous organisations wanting to reach this demographic, now wants to reveal the truth about his past for the first time. Aged 19, McSwiggan performed in a series of live webcam shows having unprotected sex with two other men. The broadcasts have since been recorded and uploaded to multiple websites against his will. Id like to apologise for the fact that theyre out there, he tells BuzzFeed News, his normally perky tone distinctly more sombre. I want to be a positive role model for people so these images arent what I want people to be seeing. But his reasons for divulging everything now are not only to pre-empt those threatening to do so for him. Im trying to put myself back in the drivers seat and own it and say, Yes theres things out there, but Im going to give context to it, explain it, and defend myself. As the story unfolds, dark enough to serve as a cautionary tale, it reveals something else about McSwiggan that explains far more than he realises. The story begins when McSwiggan was at university in Derby. He had been working part-time at a postal delivery company when colleagues began homophobically bullying him, he says, and when he complained, he was sacked. Instagram Instagram Instagram I remember looking around for other part-time work working in factories and shops but I was really scared about going back into something like that in case things [the bullying] repeated. A short while later, an altogether different opportunity arose. Two friends suggested we try out webcam shows. Theyd seen people making money off it and hoped I would do it with them as a threeway. The live sessions in which members of the public can interact with the performers, telling them what to do in exchange for money began innocently enough. The first time we did it we were fully clothed and just chatted to people online through a live chat feed, he says. We were getting a lot of money people were tipping. We made a couple of hundred pounds that first show, so it seemed like a really easy way to make money. And we thought, What happens if we take this further? It didnt feel like a big deal at the time it was a bit of fun and I didnt think about the long-term consequences. Before turning the shows X-rated, McSwiggan investigated the site on which they were hosted, which also featured many other similar performers. The small print reassured him the live performances could not be recorded or uploaded elsewhere. Obviously that was stupidity and naivety because people did record it and now its everywhere, he says. From the second show, everything escalated rapidly. People started saying, Oh, Ill tip you 200 if you take your shirts off; Ill send you 150 if you take your jeans off. So at first it was taking off clothes and then it was doing sexual acts and before we knew it, it was full sex. View this image  Joe Newman / SWNS for BuzzFeed The shows proved more successful than McSwiggan expected, with thousands watching and paying to see explicit performances between him and his two friends. The knowledge of how many were watching made him uncomfortable, but, he adds, I thought as soon as we finished the show nobody would ever see it again. If Id known that years later it would still be there I would never have done it. After a few weeks of these performances, which ran four times a week, the now popular trio were the most watched on the site. We were told [by the site] if we continued performing [like this] by the end of the month we could win this big prize 2,000. They won it, but by then, their earnings from viewers tips were five times this amount. Porn companies started approaching them, asking the three guys to appear in films. They declined. What emerges now is how conflicted McSwiggan felt. He enjoyed the money, which prevented him having to work in another hostile environment, but what was happening internally could not be conveyed by the camera. I was numb and oblivious to what I was doing, he says. I was just thinking about the money. I look back and see the videos now and Im smiling and laughing but in my head I know that on the inside I wasnt enjoying myself. It was all for show. This gap between appearance and experience is so commonly expressed by sex workers it is perhaps surprising anyone would assume otherwise. But, says McSwiggan, the fact that so many dont is one of the reasons he wanted to speak out. I want people to know the truth: Just because were smiling doesnt mean thats what we were feeling. Its particularly important that this message reaches young gay people, he adds, as sex work is so normalised within the gay community it makes it seem like, Oh yeah, I can just do this for a bit of money, but there are so many consequences that go with it. View this image  Joe Newman / SWNS for BuzzFeed It was too late by the time he found this out. The live shows, which he believed would evaporate into the ether, started appearing on porn sites. At first, every time one would pop up Id issue them [the site in question] with a take-down notice and say, I own the copyright for this, please take it down. And they usually would but for every one I got taken down, 10 more would pop up. It got out of control. Now there are so many out there I dont even know about most of them. McSwiggan wants people to know what it is like to have such intimate moments accessible by anyone. It makes me feel gross, he says. Violated. Ive no control over it. I dont want people I know going on to the internet and seeing these videos of me, and I know making it public like this means a load of people are going to google it and find it. But, he says, hes learning to accept such powerlessness there is nothing he can do about it. Theres also nothing he can do to change the fact that he didnt wear condoms. Although we were all tested before we did it and knew we were negative, when you watch the videos theres no context to that, it just looks like were having unprotected sex, and thats not something I want to promote. I promote the opposite its something I say in my videos: Dont bareback, make sure youre using protection. I dont want this to damage my reputation and all the things Ive worked so hard to do. (It is worth pointing out, however, that even when both partners take an HIV test before unprotected sex, it can only pick up the virus several weeks after transmission, and therefore this is not a fail-safe method.) Instagram Instagram McSwiggan with Sophie Ellis-Bextor, and, right, with Tom Daley As McSwiggans YouTube channel grew in popularity, with his face becoming well-known and his videos exploring increasingly serious issues such as mental illness and sexual health, viewers began connecting him to the X-rated videos. Some made comments under the YouTube videos. One person threatened and said they were going to tell my mum, he says. Some people were being quite malicious and vindictive with it. Before approaching BuzzFeed News, McSwiggan disclosed everything to his parents, who were, he says, very supportive. They were disappointed I didnt go to them for money, he says sadly. I guess I was too proud. But their loving reaction provided the biggest relief for him. My parents finding out was always the scariest thing for me. I didnt want them to be ashamed of me. He seems relieved to be talking about it now. He describes it as a huge secret and starts to illustrate some of the sobering realities of life after porn. Every time I dated a guy it would eventually come up: Oh by the way, theres naked videos of me on the internet. Thats not an easy conversation to have. Ultimately, he wants to use what happened to send a message to young people. I want it to serve as a warning, because I know how enticing the porn industry can be and so often it preys on young, naive people, he says. Suddenly, his YouTube work seems clear: Perhaps all along it was an attempt to prevent kids falling into the traps he did. Gay teenagers learn little or nothing about gay adult life at school. More often we learn from mistakes that cannot be undone. To watch McSwiggan talking on camera in his bouncy, sunny way, often while delivering important messages, his popularity makes sense too: Hes the older brother many gay teens desperately need. And as if to finally integrate the two parts of his online life, hes uploaded a video to his YouTube channel at the same time as this interview, to talk directly to his audience. YouTube He returns again to his own mistakes, repeated by many others. There are so many 18-year-olds in porn, and yes, youre legally able to consent at that age, but do you really have the right head on your shoulders to make that decision? He pauses for a moment, and for the first time seems angry. I certainly didnt.

aS"Im exasperated, hurt, and angry. View this image  Chris Ratcliffe / Getty Images Liberal and LGBT Christians have reacted with fury and disappointment over the Anglican Communions decision on Thursday to suspend the US Episcopal Church for three years following its decision to allow priests to marry same-sex couples. After a statement by the communion that accused the Episcopal Church of a fundamental departure from the majority of our Provinces on the doctrine of marriage, LGBT Anglicans told BuzzFeed News that the vote, which will cast the US branch adrift from the communion, emphasises the second-class citizen status of gay people in Anglican churches, puts LGBT people in danger of further persecution, and will lead to dwindling church attendances. At a press conference on Friday, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said Anglican primates took the decision because the US church had acted on same-sex marriage without consultation. It was not being punished, as it had autonomy over its decisions, Welby insisted, but those decisions had consequences within the broader Anglican Communion. He admitted the decision put the Anglican Communion out of step with public opinion in UK and the US but not in other parts of the world, and said it was a global church. As Welby spoke, a peaceful protest took place outside Canterbury Cathedral by LGBT Christians, each of whom had paid the 10.50 entrance fee, holding banners reading Anglicans! Repent your homophobia and Homosexuality is godly. Homophobia is not. Canterbury today Tracey Byrne, the head of the Lesbian & Gay Christian Movement, told BuzzFeed News the communions intervention, which prevented a predicted and dramatic schism over homosexuality, represents a phoney unity, which is the result of chucking LGBT people under a bus again. She added: Im exasperated, hurt, and angry, in particular for the LGBT people in Africa, because I cannot understand how this makes them safer. Byrne accused Welby of prioritising church unity over morality. This condemns LGBT people to another 3, 5, 10 years of being the problem, and during that time church attendances are going to continue to plummet, she said. LGBT people in Africa are being put in danger by this. People are going to be harmed. AnglicanNews.org AnglicanNews.org Rev Jide Macaulay, founder of House of Rainbow, echoed Byrnes concerns: I am appalled and deeply concerned by the outcome of the primates meeting. The re-emphasising of marriage as between one man and one woman will further legalise the ostracism of LGBT people, especially in Africa. What the church is saying is that LGBT people are not part of the church nor loved by God. This is sad for me and many more who had hoped for change and fairness. View this image  Rev Jide Macaulay Twitter Andrew Cain, the Vicar of St. Marys, Kilburn, who married his husband in defiance of the Anglican position, also criticised Welby. Im ashamed of the leadership of the church for this, he told BuzzFeed News. He referred to a leaked version of Welbys address to the communion that talks about the exemptions given to the Church of England over equal marriage as being a sign of our strength. Actually its a sign of our weakness parliament turned round and said, Stand in the corner, were doing it anyway. It says more about Welbys mindset that he looks at defeat and defeats in our influence in the world and sees that as a victory. Cain added that this latest development in the communion is a retreat into irrelevance and accused the upper echelons of the communion of living in a bubble, almost entirely isolated from the world. However, Cain characterised this weeks action against the Episcopal Church as merely a setback, saying conservative Christians are not going to win this, as in another couple of years public opinion will have changed even more firmly to our side. Fundamentally, he said, the bishops have a choice: Do they want to lead a diminishing sect or lead a national church which has a moral voice in wider society? They need to wake up if they want the Church of England to survive. View this image  Protestors in Canterbury Twitter Rev Giles Fraser, an Anglican priest in south London and a noted campaigner for LGBT rights, reacted to yesterdays news with fury. He was, he told BuzzFeed News, bloody angry, saying: The church had a choice between siding with those people who would imprison gay people and those people whod marry them, and its sided with people who would imprison gay people. But like Cain, Fraser saw this weeks move as ultimately inconsequential, because the Anglican Communion is just one of these transnational bodies that has very little impact on how we go about our daily lives. Its a product of empire, a colonialist project thats increasingly past its sell-by date. It got reinvented by conservatives in the 1990s when they realised that on the issue of homosexuality theyre in the minority in this country. He elaborated that the communion only became important to give conservatives an authority over the question of homosexuality. Homosexuality isnt destroying the Anglican Communion. Homosexuality invented the Anglican Communion. Shouldn't the C of E be repenting of its colonial past and ditching the whole vanity project that is the Anglican Communion? Rather than attempting to hold the global Anglican church together, Fraser saw no harm in it fracturing. One church shouldnt impose its particular reading of scripture on another, he said. A much looser federation is the right way to go. Others were less angry but more disappointed. The broadcaster Rev Richard Coles, who is in a civil partnership with a fellow Anglican priest, told Buzzfeed News: It was not as bad as it could have been. The efforts of the conservatives to get the majority to comply with their view could have been much nastier. Its a slap on the wrist. I think in the end love prevails. But look what we do to love before it does: We nail it to a cross. The presiding bishop of the Anglican Church in America speaks from the naughty step. Asked to what extent he felt morally compromised working within the Church of England, Coles replied that he has realistic expectations after years of experience about how the church is going to behave. However, If a young LGBT person asked me if they would find the church a place of safety, welcome, and acceptance, I just couldnt say yes to that. And thats heartbreaking. View this image  Rev Richard Coles Twitter / Richard Coles Labour MP Chris Bryant, a former Anglican vicar, tweeted his apparent despair at the communions decision: Ive finally given up on Anglican church today after its love-empty decision on sexuality. One day it will seem wrong as supporting slavery. I've finally given up on Anglican church today after its love-empty decision on sexuality. One day it will seem wrong as supporting slavery.  And Rev Susan Russell, an Episcopal priest in California, wrote on the Huffington Post that the sanction against her church was sad but not surprising. She also expressed defiance against the decision, saying she felt pride that we have become a church where using the lives and vocations of our LGBT members as sacrificial lambs on the altar of global Anglican politics is no longer an option. Despite the righteous indignation articulated among LGBT Christians, no one BuzzFeed News spoke to wanted to leave the church, but rather vowed to continue campaigning from within it. Yes Im part of an institution that is by its nature profoundly homophobic and actively so, said Cain. And that is a very uncomfortable position to be in. [But] the conservatives think this is victory; in the long term, its nothing. Theyve told the Episcopal Church to sit on the naughty step for three years is that the best they can do? Fraser remained committed to championing LGBT liberation, as its a basic issue of justice. The idea that you celebrate love wherever you find it is absolutely a core Christian value. And Byrne said, Ive a right to be in that church, as has every LGBT person. Im not going anywhere. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!  Tagged:anglican communion, same sexmarriage by Sarah A.

aS"It should never have been a crime in the first place. View this image  On Wednesday, Queensland attorney general Yvette DAth said the Labor government would take action on their election commitment to expunge the convictions, joining Tasmania, NSW, Victoria and the ACT. Our laws have acknowledged consensual homosexual sex as legal since 1991, said DAth. Its time to ensure that members of our community are not burdened by criminal convictions for something that should never have been a crime in the first place. The announcement came just months after the Liberal Tasmanian government issued a similar pledge, with expungement schemes already in place in NSW, Victoria and the ACT. View this image  However, WA attorney general Michael Mischin told BuzzFeed News that his state has no current plans for similar legislation. Blanket legislation to erase such convictions may not be practical and probably unnecessary, he said. It was the policy in Western Australia, for many years before the decriminalisation of homosexual conduct, not to prosecute that conduct if the parties were adults exercising informed consent. The sorts of offences with which homosexuals could be charged also covered other, non-consensual, conduct, including against children each conviction would need to be considered on a case-by-case basis to see if it were appropriate to be expunged. South Australia and the Northern Territory also do not have legislation that erases such convictions. View this image  *Although decriminalisation passed through the ACT legislative assembly in May 1975, at the time the ACT were not self-governing. The Commonwealth had to ratify the bill before it could be enacted, and this occurred in November 1976. Victoria was the first state to introduce an expungement scheme, with legislation passing both the upper and lower houses of the Victorian parliament on October 14, 2014. NSW followed soon after, amending its Criminal Records Act 1991 to allow historic homosexual sex offences to be extinguished on November 24, 2014. Similar legislation passed the ACT legislative assembly on October 29, 2015. Meanwhile, the Tasmanian government announced its intention to enact a similar scheme in December last year. In a historic gesture, attorney general Vanessa Goodwin also said those affected by the laws would receive a formal apology making Tasmania the first state to make such a commitment. View this image  In South Australia, a 2013 amendment allowed people convicted of historical sex offences to apply to have their convictions spent but not expunged. This is also the case in Western Australia, where it is illegal to discriminate against a person on the basis of a spent conviction. When a conviction is expunged, it is erased in the eyes of the law. The conviction no longer shows up on a police records check, people are not required to disclose it for any reason, and they cannot be denied a job because of it. A conviction being spent is a slightly different process, which only allows the criminal record to be amended after a time period of not offending in SA and WA, ten years. There are also certain exemptions where a spent conviction must be disclosed, which is not the case for an expunged conviction. The Northern Territory attorney generals office did not respond to a request for comment by time of publication. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The American branch of the 80-million-member Anglican Communion has been suspended for allowing priests to perform same-sex marriages. View this image  The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, delivers his Christmas Day sermon Chris Ratcliffe / Getty Images Leaders of the 80-million-member Anglican Communion decided Thursday to suspend its U.S. affiliate, the Episcopal Church, for a three-year period in response to a decision last year allowing priests to marry same-sex couples. Leaders of Anglican denominations from around the world headed into their summit this week in Canterbury, England bracing for a schism in the Communion over the issue. A conservative bloc known as the Global Anglican Future or GAFCON was threatening to walk out of the meeting if the Episcopal Church was not censured, and the global head of the church, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, went as far as to tell the BBC that such a split would not be a disaster. One church leader, Archbishop Stanley Ntagali of the Church of Uganda, did withdraw from the meeting after the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Church of Canada which is due to vote on performing same-sex marriages in 2016 rejected his request that they voluntarily withdraw. But the conservative bishops ultimately prevailed. Recent developments in The Episcopal Church with respect to a change in their Canon on marriage represent a fundamental departure from the faith and teaching held by the majority of our Provinces on the doctrine of marriage, the gathered primates, or heads of each of the thirty-eight churches in the Anglican Communion, said in a statement, also appearing to signal that a similar step could be taken against the Canadian church if it formally allows same-sex marriages. Many of us have committed ourselves and our church to being a house of prayer for all people, as the Bible says, when all are truly welcome, Episcopal Church Presiding Bishop Michael B. Curry told the body ahead of the vote in remarks he later provided to Episcopal News Service. View this image  Episcopal Church Presiding Bishop Michael Curry Jose Luis Magana / AP Our commitment to be an inclusive church is not based on a social theory or capitulation to the ways of the culture, but on our belief that the outstretched arms of Jesus on the cross are a sign of the very love of God reaching out to us all, Curry continued. While I understand that many disagree with us, our decision regarding marriage is based on the belief that the words of the Apostle Paul to the Galatians are true for the church today: All who have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is no longer Jew or Gentile, slave or free, male or female, for all are one in Christ. The vote means that the Episcopal Church will no longer have a vote in church bodies and will not be able to represent the worldwide Communion in ecumenical bodies. The Episcopal Church is a relatively small denomination in the United States, accounting for just 1.2 percent of Americans. But the debate over homosexuality within the denomination has had global implications. The debate over greater acceptance of same-sex relationships polarized the Communion in meetings stretching back almost two decades. When a group of conservative churches in the United States broke away in 2007 from the Episcopal Church in response to the 2003 consecration of out gay Bishop Gene Robinson of New Hampshire, some attempted to reorganize under the archbishop of the Church of Uganda. These direct confrontations within the communion contributed to the growing concern over homosexuality in some African countries with large Anglican churches, such as Uganda and Nigeria. Both nations later enacted broad anti-LGBT laws in 2014, though Ugandas was ultimately struck down by the countrys Constitutional Court.   Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Do you start pitching a tent in your pants every time you see another man? the bills author said. So you can shove it into the guys backside? View this image  A man tries to grab a poster reading Marriage, Children, Security from two gay rights protesters, Moscow, 2014. Pavel Golovkin / AP Russias parliament is poised to take up a bill next week that LGBT advocates say is the most significant anti-LGBT legislation it has considered since passage of the so-called gay propaganda law, which was adopted in 2013. The bill, introduced in October by two members of the opposition Communist Party, is being described as banning gays and lesbians for coming out. The text as it stands would penalize the public expression of nontraditional sexual relations, manifested in a public demonstration of personal perverted sexual preferences in public places. This would be punishable by a maximum fine equivalent to around $65 and, if the infraction happened in schools or a cultural institution, detention of up to 15 days. Other anti-LGBT laws have been proposed by Russian lawmakers, but this would be the first the parliament will formally take up if it the bill actually gets a first reading in the Dumas lower house its currently scheduled for Jan. 22. LGBT rights supporters in the country were hoping this would disappear from the agenda, like an earlier proposal that would have stripped gays and lesbians of all parental rights, but they are growing nervous now it has been put on the Dumas official schedule. When this draft bill was initiated, it was so incredibly absurd that we were hoping it was going to be one of those initiatives that didnt get any attention, Polina Andrianova of the St. Petersburg LGBT rights organization Coming Out told BuzzFeed News in a phone interview. But the fact that its scheduled for the first reading is a pretty bad sign. View this image  Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev addresses the State Duma. Pavel Golovkin / AP Ivan Nikitchuk, one of the lawmakers who sponsored the law, said in an interview with the Russian outlet Meduza published on Thursday that he drafted the proposal to stop sick and crazy people from displaying their demonic desires which the West has forced on us. The preamble to the proposal includes a rebuttal of 2011 speech Hillary Clinton gave at the United Nations declaring gay rights are human rights, which Nikitchuk said he included because human rights arent everything! This is getting to be absurd, he told Meduza. There are people who like to piss on the street in public. Lets go ahead and defend their rights! Weve reached the point of absurdity, when it comes to talking about human rights. This is especially true in the West. Just look at whats happening in Cologne! an apparent reference to allegations of widespread sexual assault by immigrants that took place in the German city on New Years Eve. And all these bearded men kissing is nothing but nauseating, he said, later asking the interviewer with Meduza, Are you a normal, decent person? Do you start pitching a tent in your pants every time you see another man? So you can shove it into the guys backside? That kind of thing is okay by you? Human Rights Watchs Russia Researcher Tanya Cooper said the fact that the proposal is prompting a new outpouring of this kind of anti-LGBT rhetoric from lawmakers could ultimately do greater harm than the bill itself if it is passed. What concerns me even more is the bills authors hate comments in the media, Cooper wrote in an email to BuzzFeed News. Russians dont need this law to be passed to start (or continue) attacking LGBT people on the street, firing them from work, discriminating in other areas of life. Supporters of LGBT rights in Russia say its not clear what practical impact this law would even have if passed laws are often randomly enforced in Russia and charges are often brought under provisions that seem only loosely connected to the letter of the law. The gay propaganda law technically prohibits the promotion of non-traditional sexual relationships to minors, but can be invoked to cover a broad range of official harassment of LGBT people. Coming Outs Andrianova said LGBT advocates are generally keeping a low-profile until they see if the law passes the first reading, though they are circulating a Change.org petition against the law. They worry that more visible protests against the proposal would actually make it more likely to gain traction. If it passes, she said, it will probably create a second wave of harassment of LGBT people, following the one that followed passage of the gay propaganda law. This will give more of a green light to people who are willing to discriminate [and] to beat people up, she said. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"I can think of no group that suffers more discrimination than trans people, said the committee chair.  View this image  Carl Court / AFP / Getty Images Transgender issues should never be treated as a mental health problem, according to a radical parliamentary report published on Thursday that demands a complete overhaul of the legal protections for transgender people in the UK. The House of Commons women and equalities committee said the government should introduce a non-binary gender option on passports, require all police officers to undergo transphobic hate crime training, and ensure transgender people cannot be excluded from single-sex institutions such as womens refuges. The report also insists transgender prisoners should be allowed to serve their sentence in a prison that is appropriate to their gender, says 16- and 17-year-olds should be allowed to switch their legal gender, and calls for an explicit ban on anti-transgender hate speech. I can think of no group that suffers more discrimination than trans people, committee chair Maria Miller told BuzzFeed News. We must think about the human rights of every single person who lives in our country, and at the moment the human rights of trans people are not fully protected. Miller, a former Conservative equalities minister, said it was also time to move away from an arrangement where individuals are only allowed to legally switch gender if they gain a legal certificate through the approval of a quasi-judicial system in which a panel of doctors and lawyers decide on your gender for you. Instead, the committee concluded the government should swiftly follow the lead of Ireland, Malta, and Argentina and move towards a system of gender self-declaration, making it easier for adults to transition without going through a legal system that often requires them to have publicly lived in a different gender for several years. Miller also said people with gender dysphoria who wish to have surgery should no longer be treated as mental health patients on the NHS: Having support for trans people located in mental health services is a relic of the past. In many ways it has been treated in a similar way to other LGB issues decades ago: We shouldnt be treating trans people as if they have a mental health problem or as if they have a disease. There is clear evidence that public attitude is well ahead of the law, Miller concluded. Almost half the population accept that gender is fluid and is not as simple as male or female. There will be a minority of people who might be uncomfortable about that, but parliament is there to represent the way that society is today. View this image  Guillermo Legaria / AFP / Getty Images Among the committees many recommendations is a call for greater funding for transgender treatment from the health service, including making more staff available to help transgender people who want to have gender confirmation surgery and ensuring patients have their first assessment within 18 weeks. Official forms should no longer ask for an individuals gender unless necessary and that information should not be stored as standard, according to the committee. Instead they say the UK must follow Australias lead in introducing an option to record gender as X on a passport, although this would require fresh legislation. Following the deaths of multiple transgender women in mens prisons, the report says transgender criminals should not be placed in solitary confinement purely because of their gender. There is a clear risk of harm (including violence, sexual assault, self-harming and suicide) where trans prisoners are not located in a prison or other setting appropriate to their acquired / affirmed gender, the report says. The committee also calls on the government to investigate why there have been no prosecutions of people who abused confidential information about a transgender individuals gender, and said courts should ensure people are not inadvertently identified as transgender against their wishes. Christine Burns, a leading expert in transgender issues who has helped shape previous legislation, told BuzzFeed News she broadly welcomed the recommendations, including a proposal to ensure same-sex institutions such as womens rape crisis centres do not exclude transgender people on the basis of the gender they were assigned at birth. We should always legislate on the basis of good evidence and there simply is no evidence of this mythical beast of trans people abusing other women, she explained. Quite the reverse. The vulnerable people tend to be the trans people getting abused by all and sundry, so theres a real need for trans people having access to shelters. She also said the governments proposal to make it easier to gain legal gender recognition would cut paperwork and costs: Its a profoundly conservative proposal, doing away with red tape. One of the things that has concerned me is that probably only half the people who are eligible for gender recognition certificates have actually applied for them because of the perception of how intrusive the process is. But Burns, who has written two books on trans equality issues, insisted the main issue remained the shortage of NHS funding and staff for transgender people: Because the sector has been starved for generations you also have to build up the capacity of specialists to provide treatment. The GIC [gender identity clinic] in Charing Cross has about 3,000 people at any one time. Thats gone up in leaps and bounds in the last 10 years. Theyre running to keep up. In response to the report the government has pledged to make transgender issues a priority and consider all the committees recommendations. Education and equalities minister Nicky Morgan said transgender equality is now a regular topic of public debate due to increased publicity in the media and she is determined to tackle discrimination against transgender people wherever it exists so that all members of our society can live their lives free from persecution, and able to fulfil their potential.

aS"But those who identify as neither have options. View this image  Nelson, a non-binary student at the University of Calgary, doesnt fit into either box so they reached out to MP Navdeep Singh Bains. Non-binary people do not identify as exclusively male or female and Nelson uses the pronoun they rather than she or he. For those who are non-binary, intersex, fluid, or transgender, selecting either male or female isnt a straightforward choice. Considering that failing to complete the census is punishable by fines or jail time, thats a problem. I have a major concern however with the exclusionary way that the category of gender/sex has in the past been strictly limited to an option of either male or female, Nelson wrote to Bains. As a non-binary transgender individual, I would be wholly unable to fill out a census (long or short) accurate and completely. View this image  A Statistics Canada spokesperson told Nelson that transgender Canadians are encouraged to indicate the sex (either male or female) with which they most identify. I think the way it was worded and what was said showed a good understanding of the issue, Nelson told BuzzFeed Canada. I especially liked the wording that trans people are encouraged to choose the option that they most identify with, which recognizes that even for people who do identify as one [gender], that its not always 100%. Those who dont fit on either end of the binary, however, do have an option. Canadians can leave the question blank as long as they explain why in the comments section. This option will also be available if the form is completed online. Statistics Canada also told BuzzFeed Canada it has established a process that will assist transgender people in responding to the 2016 Census and information will be available online. Census staff will also be trained to provide information on how to skip the question. View this image  Statistics Canada will be consulting Canadians on the contents of the questionnaire, so there is potential for change. This will afford us the opportunity to gather information on our users and uses of Census data and evaluate if there are new ways to collect data for respondents who do not identify themselves with the current response options, said Statistics Canada. Nelson hopes this is a sign the government is moving toward better inclusivity. Were already on a pretty fast track to getting people more aware that non-binary people exist and are valid, said Nelson. I also really want to see, and need to see, government agencies, especially registry agencies, allow people to have some other form of gender marker on their IDs, if at all.

aS'How can it be both so easy and so hard to say a few short words? View this image  The secretary of state for Scotland, who is the first openly gay Tory cabinet minister, described his announcement as one of the most important decisions of my life. How can it be both so easy and so hard to say a few short words? he wrote in a message on his website. In the end, it took just a couple of taps on a keyboard, yet at some points, in my mind, it was going to be harder than standing for election, speaking in the House of Commons or being cross-examined on television. I still cannot fully rationalise such feelings, but I know they are not uncommon, particularly in men of my age. Scotlands only Conservative MP has a strong record of voting for the extension of LGBT rights, including same-sex marriage. Originally a member of the Scottish parliament, the 53-year-old has represented the Westminster constituency of Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale, and Tweeddale since 2005 and has three adult children. He has served in David Camerons cabinet as secretary of state for Scotland since the 2015 general election. Gender and sexuality should make no difference whether you are a cabinet minister or in any other walk of life and I hope that I can, in my own way, reinforce that message, he concluded. A Downing Street spokesperson said David Cameron had been told of Mundells decision in recent days. More No10 spoksmn on Mundell coming out as gay:"The Prime Minister is very pleased + delighted that he\'s bn in a position to take this step" I know that David didnt make todays statement lightly, but approached it in his typically thoughtful and positive manner. 1/2 He has my wholehearted support, as well as the support of the wider Scottish Conservative family. 2/2 New Year, new start! I have already set out my political priorities for the year and now I am setting out my personal one. Having taken one of the most important decisions of my life and resolved to come out publicly as gay in 2016, I just want to get on with it, and now, just like that, I have said it. How can it be both so easy and so hard to say a few short words? In the end, it took just a couple of taps on a keyboard, yet at some points, in my mind, it was going to be harder than standing for election, speaking in the House of Commons or being cross-examined on television. I still cannot fully rationalise such feelings, but I know they are not uncommon, particularly in men of my age. Of course, everybody who gets to this point, has had their own journey. I have certainly been on mine - conflicting emotions, of doubts and fears, but ultimately positive and uplifting, with an unstoppable direction of travel. Over time, I came to understand that, for me, the only way to be truly happy on a personal level is to acknowledge in public as well as in private, who I am. I so admire the many people, young and old, who are doing this every day, uncertain of the reaction. I have been very fortunate and couldnt have had more love and support from my family and friends. However, making this public is something I have had to do myself. I dont know what the wider reaction will be, but I know its the right thing for me to do. Other than the intensely personal and positive difference it makes to me, and the way I can live my life, my hope is that my coming out doesnt change anything else about how I go about my work or how people treat me. Gender and sexuality should make no difference whether you are a Cabinet Minister or in any other walk of life and I hope that I can, in my own way, reinforce that message.

aS"With bills stacking up at the state legislature, many hoped Gov. Mike Pence would be a guiding light after last years dispute over religious freedom and LGBT discrimination. That didnt happen on Tuesday. View this image  AP / Darron Cummings With eyes from around Indiana on Mike Pence to guide the way out of the states veritable civil war a fight between LGBT rights and religious freedom the Republican governor instead stunned some onlookers Tuesday night by taking no position at all. This is a complete letdown, Chris Paulsen, the campaign manager of LGBT rights group Freedom Indiana, said in a statement released as Pence delivered his annual State of the State address. If anything, Pence made the political waters murkier by nodding to both sides of the debate, opposing discrimination while also supporting religious freedom, without addressing the content of a half-dozen bills piling up in the legislature. I will always give careful consideration to any bill you send me, Pence told a joint session of the legislature. In doing so, Pence effectively punted one of the states most contested issues when many thought he could be a bellwether. Pence had been widely expected to announce some sort of position on LGBT nondiscrimination legislation, a move that could heal Indianas bruises from last years explosive legislative session. Lawmakers passed an uncommonly broad religious freedom bill that critics around the U.S. said would allow businesses to turn away LGBT customers leading business leaders, LGBT advocates, and legislators scrambling to push new bills this year that would show LGBT people are welcome in Indiana. Last year, we saw how vulnerable Indiana is to negative public perceptions, Peter Hanscom, a spokesman for Indiana Competes a coalition of 392 Indiana-based businesses told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday before Pences comments. We want Pence to take decisive action to say to the nation and the world that you can do business in Indiana, we are a welcoming state for all people, and we are a competitive in the global economy, Hanscom added. Business lobbies have been a traditional part of the GOP base in Indiana, where both chambers of the legislature and the governors office are controlled by Republicans, but the corporate interests have this year pushed for a comprehensive LGBT nondiscrimination bill at odds with some party leaders. Instead, Pences remarks leaned more toward religious freedom than LGBT rights he did not directly address lesbians, gays, bisexuals, or transgender people in the speech. I will not support any bill that diminished the religious freedom of Hoosiers or interferes with the Constitutional rights of our citizens to live out their beliefs in worship, service, or work, Pence said. The bills lawmakers have filed on LGBT rights this month vary widely, with policy features that range from omitting transgender protections entirely to preempting existing local nondiscrimination laws. Other bills define religious organizations so broadly that business advocates told BuzzFeed News the rules could be manipulated to turn away LGBT people. National LGBT rights group Human Rights Campaign lamented Pences annual address. The state is in urgent need of leadership by the Governor to undo the damage from last years debacle, and Pence is clearly unwilling or incapable of doing the job, JoDee Winterhof, senior vice president for policy and political affairs, said in a statement.

aS"Rep. Jim Jordan confirmed tickets from his office made it to Kentucky county clerk and her attorney by way of the anti-LGBT Family Research Council. View this image  AP / Timothy D. Easley Lawyers for Kim Davis announced Tuesday that the Kentucky clerk who is slogging through a legal battle over denying marriage licenses would attend President Obamas State of the Union address. It was news that took many by surprise, including, apparently, the congressman whose office supplied the tickets. After the announcement, the Christian advocacy law firm Liberty Counsel refused to tell BuzzFeed News which member of Congress actually invited Davis and her lawyer, Mat Staver. But by mid-afternoon, rumors emerged that Davis had secured her ticket through Rep. Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio. Jordan told BuzzFeed News that his office provided the ticket through a third party, but he did not know until after the announcement on Tuesday that it had gone to Davis. Kim Davis used our ticket, he said Tuesday evening. Our staff heard from the Family Research Council that Ms. Davis and her family hoped to attend the State of the Union address and so I offered a ticket. However, Huffington Post reporter Matt Fullers reports painted a less clear pathway for the invitation. In the first of two interviews, Jordan initially told the Huffington Post he didnt invite anyone. He also said he gave his gave tickets to the Family Research Council, a conservative group that opposes LGBT rights, but would have to check with his staff to find out if the tickets went to Davis. Jordan later told the Huffington Post: Yeah, so we gave a ticket to at the request of the Family Research Council we gave the ticket to Kim Davis family. I found out today, he added. Rep. David Cicilline, Democrat from Rhode Island, on Twitter called Daviss invite an insult to every LGBT American. The news release from Daviss lawyers on Tuesday trumpeted the pairs attendance as an affront to an administration that has been hostile to people who oppose LGBT rights on religious grounds. While the President will be extolling his accomplishments of the last seven years, Kim Davis and Mat Staver will be a visible reminder of the Administrations attack on religious liberty and an encouragement for people of faith to stand, the announcement said. In contrast to Davis, Jim Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in the court case that led the Supreme Court s marriage equality ruling, will be sitting by First Lady Michelle Obama. Daviss stratospheric rise to national fame came after the Supreme Court ruled in June that state bans on same-sex marriage violated the U.S. Constitution. Davis responded by refusing to issue a marriage license to anyone claiming that her name appearing on the licenses of same-sex couples infringed on her religious liberty. Elected as the Rowan County clerk, Davis was soon jailed for disobeying a federal court order to issue the marriage licenses, making her a cause clbre for antiLGBT-rights activists and politicians. Davis met with Pope Francis after her release, but Davis and Liberty Counsel a self-proclaimed Christian ministry never produced evidence for their repeated claim that Davis and pope had met privately. Liberty Counsel was elevated to notoriety along with Daviss case, and it used the invitation to the presidents congressional address Tuesday to grind an axe on a wide range of conservative causes. The Obama Administration has trampled religious liberty over and over, the press release said, including denying applications for tax-free status to conservative organizations, requiring Christian-owned businesses and nonprofits to pay for abortion-inducing drugs, opposing the amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would have protected the religious rights of our military, and supporting same-sex marriage, just to name a few. Kentucky voters elected a Republican governor who issued an executive order stating that county clerks need not include their name on marriage licenses, but the case against Davis is proceeding in federal court. A federal appellate court and the Supreme Court had refused to intervene in summer. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Wong Hei shared an article suggesting a former Chinese leader was gay, leading to his erasure from a reality show. View this image  CNTV China state television broadcaster CCTV digitally erased an actor from a program broadcast on Sunday after he shared an article on his Facebook page suggesting Chinas first communist premier, Zhou Enlai, was gay. The article that reportedly got actor Wong Hei in trouble concerned a new book published in Hong Kong that argues diary entries show Zhou was in love with a high school classmate. In a December post that appears to have since been deleted, Wong shared the article commenting, Qu Yuans descendant, a reference to an ancient Chinese poet whom several scholars believe had a love affair with the countrys king, and whose death is commemorated in an annual festival . Wongs post provoked an uproar in Chinese social media, ultimately leading the director to posting an elaborate mea culpa on Jan. 1, If we had known, we wouldnt have asked. We would have asked, but not recorded. We would have recorded, but not used. We would have used, but not broadcast. But rather than pull the show, a reality program called The Great Challenge, its producers digitally removed Wong from some shots and pixelated his face in group shots. youtube.com View this image  CCTV The whole affair is not just about whether its still considered slander to suggest leaders are gay in China despite some signs of gradual social acceptance of same-sex relationships. It also shows how complicated it is for Chinese officials to control the countrys history on social media while fighting political battles with both Hong Kong and Taiwan. The confrontation started on Facebook which is banned from China but it blew up on the Chinese social network Weibo. And although Wong is a celebrity on the Chinese mainland, he is from Hong Kong, where the book about Zhou was published. The books publishing house has previously infuriated Beijing by doing things like publishing the diary of the premier who was purged from the Communist Party for sympathizing with pro-democracy activists during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. The book appeared just before five employees from another house that publishes politically sensitive titles disappeared, prompting allegations that they were abducted to the mainland. Wongs Facebook post might never have been noticed in mainland China if it hadnt been called out on Weibo by a singer named Huang An. Huang was born in Taiwan but now lives in Beijing and campaigns against formal independence for the island, which has essentially operated as an independent state since the Communist Party took power in 1949. Huang wrote in that post, which appeared on Dec. 31, that Wong earns money and buys a flat in the mainland, eating and drinking well, then condemns mainland China when [he has] returned to Hong Kong and Taiwan, the South China Morning Post reported.

aS"He was an artist that made me feel OK to be trans, bi, and an outsider. Elton John and Freddie Mercury were still in the closet. Boy George and George Michael were still at school. But in an interview with Melody Maker, Bowie, as ever, trailblazed. Im gay, he told the journalist Michael Watts. And always have been, even when I was David Jones. Steve Wood / Getty Jack Kay / Getty He would revise this description four years later and announce: Its true I am a bisexual. His first wife, Angie Bowie, would claim he had an affair with Mick Jagger. In 1983, Bowie told Rolling Stone magazine that in fact he was a closet heterosexual and that announcing his bisexuality was the biggest mistake [he] ever made. But by then the impact of his statements profound, political, and far-reaching was already cemented. Not least because there was the image that he entwined with the words a succession of characters and costumes that defied gender boundaries, subverting everything that men were supposed to be. He was called, in the 1970s, a gender bender a term today we might shudder at. But he became a beacon for all who felt straitjacketed by having to be straight, or a man, or having to conform to any imposed definition of gender or sexual orientation. He made being different possible. On Monday, LGBT people celebrated the scope of Bowies identity revolution by paying tribute to an artist who proved that to give gender constraints the middle finger was the ultimate liberation. To be different no longer meant being a victim; it meant triumphing. View this embed  Shocked to hear about #DavidBowie 's death.

aS'Queen Latifah did not look amused. View this image  Ricky Gervais NBC Ricky Gervais ruffled some industry feathers with his abrasive jokes while hosting the Golden Globe Awards in 2010, 2011 and 2012. He returned as host for the 2016 ceremony and made a joke about Caitlyn Jenner in his opening monologue, using her former name and employing a sexist stereotype. Im gonna be nice tonight Ive changed, he said early in the monologue. Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously. Now Caitlyn Jenner, of course. What a year shes had. She became a role model for trans people everywhere, showing great bravery in breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes. She didnt do a lot for women drivers. But, you cant have everything; not at the same time. The comedian was referring to Jenners involvement in a collision that resulted in a womans death, while echoing a clich that women are not good drivers. He followed that joke with several about how difficult Jeffery Tambor must find it to convincingly portray a transgender woman on Transparent, wondering aloud what Tambor does with his testicles while playing Maura. I know his thing is to make fun of everything, but I think if more people understood the violence trans people face every day, it would be harder to make jokes about it, Transparent creator Jill Soloway told BuzzFeed News Adam B. Vary at the ceremony. Gervais told The Hollywood Reporter in December, I can justify every joke Ive ever done and if the joke is about someone, I can do it in front of them and tell them after why its justified. He also said, I dont really joke about things that people cant help. Representatives for Gervais did not immediately respond to BuzzFeed News request for further comment on his jokes. UPDATE While introducing Eddie Redmayne and describing the actors role as a transgender woman in The Danish Girl, Gervais remarked with joke-surprise, Its a dude!

aS"This year, lets strive for media representation that doesnt turn trans people into jokes, props, or spectacles. View this image  Its a new year, and trans people continue to be in the spotlight but whenever trans stories are told in movies or TV, its usually assumed that those stories need to cater to a cisgender audience. A lot of the time, trans people arent portrayed as multidimensional humans. Instead, our lives end up being told in stereotypical ways over and over again, which become codified into tropes: themes or devices that are common and overused. As more and more trans characters are represented in the media, here are some tropes wed love to say goodbye to in 2016. Though they may have seemed cool and edgy back in the day when just having a trans person onscreen seemed progressive we need to get past these tired and unoriginal stereotypes to get to nuanced and human portrayals of trans people. View this image  A number of movies and shows, including Transparent (2015), The Danish Girl (2015), and I Am Cait (2015), use a trans persons transition and the way it upends the lives of the people around them as a central conflict. Often, the biggest concern becomes not about the well-being of the trans person, but about how their cisgender loved ones feel about them. Its time to put out more trans narratives that dont treat us as a problem to be solved. View this image  Its been a staple of trans-themed movies going way back to the severely transphobic The Silence of the Lambs (1991) and the sympathetic yet still skeevy The Crying Game (1992), but the trans nude shot has re-emerged recently. In The Danish Girl, its used when Lili, played by Eddie Redmayne, obsesses over her body in a mirror, as she tucks her penis between her legs. In the indie film Boy Meets Girl (2014), trans teenager Ricky emerges naked from a lake and asks her best friend turned love interest if he would be interested in her even with her body. In both cases, theres no other full-frontal nudity in the movie, which makes showing the body of the trans characters particularly objectifying and gratuitous. View this image  Lets face it: Casting trans characters is a huge structural problem in Hollywood, one that is slowly but surely getting better as trans actors like Jamie Clayton, Laverne Cox, and Alexandra Billings have come to the fore. But like the gay or black best friend, its become a trope to cast trans actors in supporting roles with cisgender actors playing trans people as the lead, such as in Transparent and The Danish Girl. Its always good to hire more trans actors for parts. But the more they play supporting roles opposite transgender lead characters played by cis people, the more were reminded that Hollywood capitalizes on our stories but doesnt hire us for plum roles. View this image  2015s representative for a trope thats been a staple of many movies from The Crying Game to Boys Dont Cry (1999) is Ray in Roland Emmerichs Stonewall. A Latinx gender-nonconforming femme, Ray spends the entire movie pining after the white cis hunk Danny, only to have their hopes dashed, leaving Ray in a puddle of tears. Even in the otherwise amazing Tangerine (also 2015), the plot revolves around a black trans character, Sin-dee, spending most of the movie chasing after her cheating boyfriend Chester. Memo to cisgender people: Were not that into you. View this image  Speaking of Tangerine, another trope the movie exploits is the idea that trans women are inherently more irrational and mentally unstable than other people. While the core of the movie, the friendship between Sin-Dee and Alexandra, is beautiful and nuanced, the hysterical portrayal of Sin-Dee and the way she freaks out that Chester cheated with a cisgender woman plays into the well-worn trope of the Crazy Trans Woman. The same trope got deployed in Pretty Little Liars when the primary villain character A turned out to be trans. This trope has also been immortalized not just in multiple episodes of The Jerry Springer Show but in one of the most transphobic representations in cinema: The Silence of the Lambs, throughout which a serial killers motive is presented as their desire to be female, which leads them to kill and skin women. Please, lets just let this trope die. Hide Warning This image is graphic Click to reveal View this image  Thankfully, this trope did not rear its head prominently in 2015, but its such a staple of straight dude comedy that its important not to see it resurrected. From Hangover II (2011) to Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia, not to mention plenty of Seth McFarlane-created movies and TV shows, it seems like there are plenty of cisgender male writers who cant handle their attraction to trans women. Lets hope they continue to keep their phobias and anxieties away from the screen in 2016. View this image  Though this trope has been dying out since the cringe-inducing White Chicks (2004), we still see it pop up in comedy sketches like Ew! on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. The joke here rests on men making bad or ugly women, which relies on the idea that women who dont look cisgender deserve to be derided and laughed at. There are many ways to be funny without having to make fun of gender-nonconformity, and while this trope has produced a lot of laughs at the expense of gender-nonconforming femmes over the years, its one that needs to go. View this image  There are occasional representations of trans men in movies and TV, too often as vehicles for female stars like Hilary Swank in Boys Dont Cry and Elle Fanning in About Ray (2015), but theres a huge imbalance in trans male characters compared to trans women. This plays into the spectacle that Hollywood thrives on: the idea that its shocking or titillating for male-assigned people to become women in a way that it isnt in the reverse, because it makes a lot more sense in a heteropatiarchal society for someone to want to be a man than a woman. This trope keeps the general public from gaining a deep understanding of trans mens lives. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .  Tagged:transgender, media, tropes Hey!

aS"The debate now unfolding in Malawi may revive hope that theres an opening for reform of anti-LGBT laws in the African country. View this image  Brendan Smialowski / AFP / Getty Images President Peter Mutharika of Malawi wants gay rights protected, his press secretary said on Thursday during an interview with a local radio station. The statement came shortly after the Malawian government announced it would not enforce the southeastern African countrys sodomy law. The press secretary, Gerald Viola, said in a phone interview with BuzzFeed News that he made the statement in response to a question as to whether the president agreed with an MP who wrote on Facebook that the best way to deal with this problem [of homosexuality] is to KILL them. Viola said the president believed the Malawian people should vote on whether or not to repeal the countrys colonial-era sodomy law, but said, these people are human beings and that the president was concerned about homophobia and reports that LGBT people have been beaten and locked up. While he stopped far short of endorsing measures supported by LGBT rights advocates, this is the latest sign that the country of 16 million people may one of the few places in the region where there is an opening for political reform of anti-LGBT laws. Many have hoped the sodomy law, which punishes same-sex relations with up to 14 years in prison, would be repealed after former President Joyce Banda called for parliament to remove it shortly after she took office in 2012. Her predecessor, President Bingu wa Mutharika, had been the focus of an international campaign involving celebrities like Elton John and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon for the release of a couple arrested after they reportedly held a traditional engagement party in late 2009. She backed off the repeal pledge a few months later though imposed a moratorium on its enforcement, and then she lost the presidency to Mutharika in 2014. Debate over the law flared up again last month after a couple was attacked and arrested after an alleged sexual encounter in one of their homes on Dec. 7. Charges were later dropped, following public denunciation of the arrests by officials from the United States and United Kingdom. Malawi as a member of the international community is also committed to adhere to universally accepted human rights standards, Justice Minister Samuel Tembenu said in a statement reaffirming the moratorium on Dec. 18. The Government therefore acknowledges the view expressed by international Human Rights bodies that the inclusion of offenses prohibiting homosexuality in our statute books/within our legislation may be at variance with the views held by such bodies. When asked whether President Peter Mutharika believed the sodomy law should be repealed, Press Secretary Gerald Viola said his position at the moment is pushing [the question] back to Malawians for a vote. If they say we embrace the new culture, he will say ok, Viola said. If he says we dont agree with this new culture, he is also ok. But, Viola added, when the president sees other people being victimized he believes we leave politics, laws aside we apply human dignity to be respected. God is the best judge and whatever were doing on this, Viola said. Its not good to apply punitive laws on people. Gift Trapence of the LGBT rights group CEDEP told a local newspaper after charges were dropped against the couple arrested last month that it was an encouraging step, adding in an interview with the AP, The next step will be for the government to get rid of discriminatory laws altogether, including those that criminalize consensual sex between adults of the same sex.

aS"The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission argues in a federal appeals court filing on Wednesday that sexual orientation discrimination is sex discrimination, and such sex discrimination violates Title VII. View this image  Via youtube.com The federal agency charged with enforcing existing civil rights laws has urged a federal appeals court to rule that sexual orientation discrimination is a form of sex discrimination and therefore illegal under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. In a filing at the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission wrote that sexual orientation discrimination is sex discrimination, and such sex discrimination violates Title VII. In supporting the appeal of Barbara Burrows, whose lawsuit against the College of Central Florida was tossed out by a trial court judge, the EEOC wrote, The district courts treatment of sexual orientation discrimination as distinct from sex discrimination is untenable and based on a fundamentally flawed premise. The move is the latest step from the EEOC and advocates in an effort to protect LGBT people from discrimination under existing civil rights law. A series of EEOC rulings and court cases have aimed to provide protection to transgender people through rulings that gender identity is covered under Title VII, as well as Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. A second set of rulings and cases, including Burrowss case, has focused on providing protection to lesbian, gay, and bisexual people through rulings that sexual orientation is covered under Title VII and Title IX. The EEOC ruled in July 2015 that allegations of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation necessarily state a claim of discrimination on the basis of sex barred by Title VII. That ruling, while applicable to federal agencies and in the EEOCs own work, is not binding on federal courts. The move in Burrowss case is an attempt to get federal courts to affirm its interpretation of the law. In explaining its argument in Burrowss case, the commission wrote Wednesday that there are three reasons that sexual orientation discrimination should be covered by existing laws against sex discrimination. First, the EEOC argues, sexual orientation discrimination necessarily involves gender stereotyping, which the Supreme Court has repeatedly said is banned under Title VII. [A]n employer who discriminates because of an employees homosexuality necessarily discriminates because of that employees failure to conform to a gender-based stereotype: the stereotype of opposite-sex attraction, the EEOCs lawyers write. Second, it argues, sexual orientation discrimination is a type of associational discrimination, which also violates Title VII. If a plaintiff is in a relationship with someone of the same sex, and an adverse employment consequence results from that relationship, discrimination has occurred because of [the plaintiffs] sex, in violation of Title VII, the EEOC lawyers argue in the brief. Finally, and most basically, the EEOC argues that sexual orientation discrimination is, definitionally, a type of sex discrimination. [S]exual orientation discrimination is also inherently sex-based discrimination because sexual orientation cannot be understood without reference to an individuals sex (in conjunction with the sex of those to whom the individual is physically and/or emotionally attracted). As the commission lawyers conclude, [S]exual orientation discrimination necessarily requires impermissible consideration of sex. It should therefore be held illegal under Title VII. In December, a federal judge in California agreed with the EEOCs interpretation of the issue, finding that sexual orientation discrimination is covered under the sex discrimination ban in Title IX. The Justice Department formally supported the EEOCs position as to gender identity at the end of 2014. Since then, Justice has taken that position in a handful of court cases, through the filing of statements of interest or amicus curiae briefs in cases from Texas to Virginia. The Justice Department has not, however, weighed in yet on the sexual orientation question at issue in Burrowss case.

aS'The pill that prevents HIV is not widely available in Europe. If it were, it would probably drop infections considerably, researchers say. View this image  C. Bickel / Science Translational Medicine Nearly two-thirds of new HIV infections in gay and bisexual men in the Netherlands could be prevented with antiretroviral treatment, according to a study published on Wednesday. This treatment also known as known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP is not widely available in Europe. Its not clear whether it would lead to a similar drop in infections in the U.S., where a growing number of gay and bisexual men are already getting PrEP as Truvada, the once-a-day blue pill. Still, the researchers say that the new study adds to other research showing the public health benefits of PrEP, especially when combined with frequent HIV testing. I hope that this study contributes to making the case for making PrEP available to as many individuals as possible, Oliver Ratmann, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London and leader of the new study, told BuzzFeed News. Ratmann and his colleagues looked at the medical records of 617 Dutch men who were diagnosed with HIV between July 1996 and December 2010. The Netherlands, like several other countries in northern Europe, is famous among medical researchers because the government routinely collects health and demographic data on citizens, and then makes the anonymized data available for scientific research. All hospitals have to comply, which is why we have such a comprehensive dataset, Ratmann said. Almost everyone with HIV is in it. Ratmanns team looked in particular at the specific genetic code of HIV in each of the 617 men. The viruss DNA sequence mutates rapidly as it spreads from person to person. By comparing these sequences, you can say that patient A did not infect patient B, because sequences are so dissimilar. With this approach, its not possible to determine for certain who infected who. But for each infected man, the researchers were able to identify three or four other men who could have infected him. By weighing these various probabilities, the researchers found that an estimated 71% of HIV transmissions came from men who had not been diagnosed, and 43% from men in their first year of infection, underscoring the importance of regular HIV testing. The scientists mathematical modeling also found that, 66% of the infections could have been prevented if: half of all men at risk of HIV were tested annually; those who tested positive were immediately put on treatment; and half of those who tested negative were put on PrEP. The results are particularly exciting, Ratmann said, because the Netherlands already has a high level of HIV treatment once a person tests positive. These results suggest that proactively treating men before infection could drop infection rates even more. That high level of treatment, however, also makes the Netherlands quite different from the U.S., noted Dawn Smith of the CDCs Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention. The underlying analysis methods are convincing, and findings are in the ballpark of what I would expect, Smith told BuzzFeed News by email. Still, this studys direct applicability to the United States would be a bit different in that we dont have the high coverage of antiretroviral treatment or retention in care rates here that are present in the Netherlands. Although PrEP awareness in the U.S. is on the rise, Smith added, there are still two notable barriers to making it more common. Too few gay and bisexual men know about it (or where to get it), and too few doctors know about it or know which of their patients would benefit from it. UPDATE This story has been updated to clarify that the 66% drop in HIV infections also assumes that men testing positive for HIV would be treated with antiretrovirals immediately.

aS'Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moores latest move against marriage equality is sad & pathetic, Montgomery County Probate Judge Steven Reed tweeted on Wednesday. [Update: A pending ethics complaint against Moore was updated late Wednesday.] View this image  Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore Matthew Cavanaugh / Getty Images Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, in an administrative order issued on Wednesday morning, announced that a ban on granting same-sex couples marriages remains in effect in Alabama until a specific court order is issued to end the ban. Specifically, Moore wrote that a prior order of the Alabama Supreme Court that barred probate judges from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples remains in effect. Moores order, however, makes no mention of a contradictory federal court injunction issued this past year. The U.S. Supreme Court decision from this past June in Obergefell v. Hodges, Moore wrote, only specifically struck down the marriage bans in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee. While it is precedent that would be applicable to other states bans, he wrote, it is not a specific order that would end Alabamas ban. [A]n order issued by a court with jurisdiction over the subject matter and person must be obeyed by the parties until it is reversed by orderly and proper proceedings, he explained. Moore concluded: Until further decision by the Alabama Supreme Court, the existing orders of the Alabama Supreme Court that Alabama probate judges have a ministerial duty not to issue any marriage license contrary to the Alabama Sanctity of Marriage Amendment or the Alabama Marriage Protection Act remain in full force and effect. Moore stated that he issued the order as the head of the Unified Judicial System of Alabama and under his authority to correct or alleviate any condition or situation adversely affecting the administration of justice within the state or take other action necessary for the orderly administration of justice within the state. There was no mention in Moores order of the federal case overseen by U.S. District Court Judge Callie Granade that has challenged the Alabama ban. In that case, Granade in May 2015 issued a preliminary injunction striking down the amendment and act referenced by Moore in his administrative order. The order applied to all probate judges in the state because it was the result of a class action lawsuit that included all probate judges as the defendant class but was put on hold pending the outcome of the Supreme Courts Obergefell case. After the Obergefell decision was issued, Granade issued a clarification order on July 1, 2015, noting that the preliminary injunction is now in effect and binding on all members of the Defendant Class. An attempt by one probate judge to appeal Granades ruling was dismissed as moot by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals on Oct. 20, 2015, because, the court wrote the Alabama Supreme Courts order was abrogated by the Supreme Courts decision in Obergefell v. Hodges. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which has been counsel in the marriage litigation in the state, condemned Moores order in a statement. In no way does [Moores] administrative order supersede Judge Granades federal injunction prohibiting probate judges from enforcing discriminatory Alabama marriage laws, SPLC senior staff attorney Scott McCoy said in the statement. If probate judges violate the injunction, they can be held in contempt. This is Moore yet again confusing his role as chief justice with his personal anti-LGBT agenda. Nonetheless, Moores move has stopped marriage licenses in at least one county. Mobile County Probate Judge Don Davis who had been caught between the conflicting state and federal court orders last year stopped issuing marriage licenses altogether on Wednesday afternoon. Well, we have closed, Russell Davidson, a supervisor of the courts division that handles marriage licenses, told BuzzFeed News. At this time, we are not issuing any licenses until further notice. A notice posted on the probate judges website on Wednesday afternoon read, In order to comply with the administrative order of Alabama Chief Justice Roy S. Moore dated January 6, 2016 and rulings of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Alabama, the court is not issuing marriage licenses to any applicants until further notice. This action is necessary to ensure full compliance with all court rulings that apply to the court and to Mobile County Judge of Probate Don Davis. We regret any inconvenience encountered. But it was a different story Wednesday afternoon at the Montgomery County Probate Court, where an employee who asked not to be named said workers are issuing licenses until further notice. Our marriage department is open. Probate Judge Steven Reed could not be reached directly for comment, but he did tweet about Wednesdays developments. Judge Moore\'s latest charade is just sad & pathetic. My office will ignore him & this. #alpolitics https://t.co/IAtLLoRwlX UPDATE On Wednesday evening, the Southern Poverty Law Center announced that it had updated its pending ethics complaint against Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore to include Wednesdays developments. In the supplemental filing, the organization stated, The Chief Justice continues to flout and violate the Alabama Canons of Judicial Ethics.

aS"Jossy Yendall says shes been called a hypocrite on social media for her campaign. View this image  Jossy Yendall On a recent Change petition she set up, she explains how last year she was selected to be a finalist for the Miss Galaxy Contest, a beauty pageant, in 2016. I was so proud to think that we finally live in a society that accepts transgendered women to this extent, she says. But when I emailed to secure my place I mentioned [that I was not born a female] and was instantly informed I was no longer eligible to compete. View this image  change.org Yendall, who works as an activities coordinator in a care home for the elderly, told BuzzFeed News: I dont want to slander Miss Galaxy, who I know do a lot of good charity work. Im trying to turn a negative into a positive. My hope with the petition is that itll shake up the whole system. View this image  Jossy Yendall My family were supportive, she said, They had concerns because I was so young, but I guess any parents would worry. Yendall has degrees in performing arts and care work qualifications, and wants to move into drama therapy, but, she added: I also want to model too, and get signed to an agency. View this image  Jossy Yendall I started this journey 10 years ago and there wasnt social media, she said. On her petition, she writes: Transgender women now have a prominent place in mainstream media, attitudes are clearly evolving and pageants like Miss Galaxy need to catch up. If transgendered celebrity Caitlyn Jenner can be named Woman of the Year, why cant women like us have the chance to compete in these contests? Jossy Yendall / SWNS.com SWNS.com / Jossy Yendall Overwhelmingly the reaction has been positive, but I have been called a hypocrite because I competed in Miss Transgender, she said. However, the whole reason was that trans people are marginalised and I wanted to draw attention to that fact the point was that I couldnt enter a mainstream event. I transitioned to be a woman, not to be transgender. Its part of my past, and its not the only thing about me. Im just a humble girl from Gateshead whos living the best she can and isnt that what were all fighting for: to live normal lives? I just want people to accept me as Jossy.

aS"230,294       VIEWS You want me to touch that thing with my bare hands? View this image  In a submission to an Australian senate inquiry into airport and aviation security, the National LGBTI Health Alliance reported a climate of pervasive discrimination for LGBTI people. The submission includes a lengthy complaint from an anonymous transgender person sent to one of Australias major domestic airlines about an incident early last year. The person was passing through airport security and was selected to go through a body scanner, which picked up a prosthetic worn in their underwear. I explained to the officer at the scanner that I am trans and that I was wearing a prosthetic, to which he responded that he would need to get his supervisor, the complaint reads. View this image  After entering a small room with the two men, the passenger pulled out the prosthetic for the men to see, and the supervisor put on a second glove. When again asked what the gloves were for, the supervisor responded, You want me to touch that thing with my bare hands? After placing the prosthetic in a tray and undergoing a pat-down, the supervisor opened the door for the passenger to leave. My prosthetic [was] still sitting in the tray. I asked him to close the door so that I could have some privacy, the complaint reads. He closed the door and both men stood watching me as I put it back in place. The passenger wrote that the experience left them feeling degraded and anxious about travelling. I felt that the supervisor had no regard for me as a human being and treated me as though I was a criminal. The airline in question is yet to respond to the complaint letter.

Various LGBTI groups reported that holders of X passports experienced logistical difficulties with booking flights, not being able to use the smart gate at immigration, and encountering staff unfamiliar with the marker.

aS"Spearheaded by two Kentucky Republicans, Congress partially but effectively lifted the ban on federal funding for needle exchanges, which are used to combat the spread of HIV and tuberculosis. A fight that lasted decades. View this image  Hal Rogers and Mitch McConnell Win Mcnamee / Getty Images SAN DIEGO In the waning days of 2015, congressional Republicans agreed to essentially end their decades-long opposition to federally funding state and local needle exchange programs, slipping a repeal of the ban into the end of the year omnibus spending measure with virtually no fanfare. The decision purportedly spearheaded by House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers and backed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, both from Kentucky, as well as West Virginia Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, who is on the Appropriations Committee came in response to a massive HIV/AIDS outbreak in Indiana, as well as their home states decision to implement its own exchange to combat growing heroin use. Rogers and Capito spokespeople did not return requests for comment, but a McConnell aide acknowledged that Rogers pushed for it and that McConnell ensured the language got in the bill. If youd spoken to me at the beginning of last year, Id have said were playing the long game, can we even identify a single Republican to champion this, said Michael Collins, Deputy Director of the Drug Policy Alliance. HIV/AIDS experts and activists hailed the decision. The partial repeal passed by Congress in late December will allow exchange programs to pay for staff, the vans, the gas, rent, everything but the syringes. Its basically a giant work around to conservative opposition to needle exchanges, said Dr. Steffanie Strathdee, Associate Dean of Global Health Sciences at the University of California at San Diego. It will take a lot of [financial] pressure off these groups, Strathdee added. Collins agreed, noting that the actual syringes cost almost nothing, but that in keeping the ban on funding needle purchases Republicans arent technically running afoul of the largely unfounded belief that giving needles to drug users can encourage further use. Originally implemented in 1988, the ban on needle exchanges came as much of the international community as well as researchers like Strathdee were becoming increasingly convinced that these sorts of programs could help reduce the rate of transmission of infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis amongst intravenous drug users. The lack of federal funds significantly retarded the growth of state and local programs in the 1990s and 2000s, as state houses and local governments faced increasingly tighter budgets. That, according to Strathdee, in turn hampered efforts to test vulnerable populations for HIV/AIDS and TB, since exchange programs often double as testing centers. But by 1998, after a decade of growing scientific research supporting the programs, the Clinton administration appeared on the verge of coming out in support of federally funding needle exchange programs. That April, then Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala was planning to hold a press conference announcing the decision to back lifting the ban. On April 22, then Rep. Denny Hastert who would go on to become Speaker of the House and, ultimately, plead guilty to fraud charges related to allegations he sexually abused underage boys as a wrestling coach took to the House floor to denounce the upcoming announcement by Shalala. I think we have a bad message, certainly a bad message to drug addicts to all of a sudden say it cannot be too bad. The federal government is giving me the paraphernalia to put these drugs in my veins, Hastert said. And certainly the message to parents, he added, and I think as a parent myself, and a teacher, the worst thing that I would ever want to happen is to think about my kids using drugs Yet, the federal government is actually saying, oh, by the way, if you need free needles to use drugs, you cannot use drugs. That is bad. That is illegal. But if you want the free needles to use them, here they are. As part of his floor speech, Hastert entered into congressional testimony a key paper written by Strathdee on needle exchanges in Vancouver despite the fact that the paper concluded the programs are viable programs that should be encouraged. According to an April 23 Washington Post report from that year, during a flight from Chile to the United States on Air Force One, Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey pushed Clinton to abandon a push to repeal the ban, insisting it would be too politically risky. Clinton ultimately agreed, and Shalala ultimately announced that while scientific evidence showed needle exchanges did indeed reduce transmission rates, federal funds would continue to be withheld. View this image  A disposal container is filled with hypodermic needles that were exchanged at a clinic in Portland, Maine. Robert F. Bukaty / Associated Press After Democrats took control of the House and Senate in 2006 and President Obama won election in 2008, activists and Democrats moved swiftly to repeal the ban, and in 2009 it was ended. Almost as soon as federal funds began being used for exchange programs, however, it was ended. After retaking the House in 2010, Republicans made re-enforcing the ban part of their year one priorities, and the ban was once again put in place. But by this summer, the political winds had once again shifted. Collins said the Indiana HIV/AIDS outbreak and the Kentuckys exchange program as well as the heroin epidemic that has swept through much of the Midwest over the last few years helped thaw GOP opposition to the programs. Indeed, while Rogers and McConnell had long been strident opponents to funding exchange programs, Collins said, Mr. Rogers and his staff decided they werent ready to fully lift the ban, but they were willing to do a partial lift. McConnell, meanwhile, committed to ensuring the language was in the Senates appropriations bill. Combined, the two Bluegrass lawmakers were able to ensure the repeal made it through Decembers difficult omnibus process. On Dec. 21, the Centers for Disease Control quietly announced that federal funds could begin flowing to exchange programs. In a statement on the CDC website that went unnoticed by most health officials until this week, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention Director Dr. Jonathan Mermin said: Congress has given states and local communities, under limited circumstances, the opportunity to use federal funds to support certain components of syringe services programs. These programs provide sterile injection equipment and may also link individuals to services including HIV and Hepatitis C testing and care for those infected, substance abuse treatment, and overdose prevention. For Strathdee whos research was used to implement a ban she opposed the repeal is something of a personal victory. Ive spent the last couple of decades trying to undo this when your research is deliberately misused, it really hurts, Strathdee said. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

In an interview with the UKsTelegraph, Humphries said he agreed with prominent Australian feminist Germaine Greer on transgender women, saying they are mutilated men. Self-mutilation, whats all this carry on? he said. Caitlyn Jenner what a publicity-seeking ratbag. Humphries went on to complain that if you criticise anything youre racist or sexist or homophobic. In the same interview, Humphries said he prefers to avoid publicity in the age of ever-increasing political correctness and allow his creations do the talking. View this image  Barry Humphries in costume as one of his favourite characters, Dame Edna Everage. Hes a very good actor and entertainer, but how does that make him an authority on transgender issues? said Goldner. Why is he even commenting? He has no expertise in this area. Just because he performs a certain role doesnt mean he has any knowledge of trans issues. Goldner added that when people like Humphries and Greer speak out against transgender people, it distracts from large issues facing the community. The issues we need to be talking about are accurate documentation, adequate health and medical care, the strongest possible protections from discrimination, and funding for organisations to prevent this sort of prejudice, she said. I think I would convey a huge level of frustration from the trans community that all these people, Greer, Humphries, others, think they know what our lives are about, think they can control our lives and tell us who we are. View this image  The idea that trans women arent real women is really damaging, and its irresponsible for people in public life to make those comments particularly when we look at the huge numbers of depression and suicide within the transgender community, Simms said. To refer to transgender people as self-mutilated is appalling, and I dont think anybody is laughing at Barry Humphries transphobic rant. If he wants to talk about attention-seeking, maybe he should turn the mirror on himself. Humphries publicist did not respond to a request for comment. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

Heres a look at the next generation of actors stepping into those formidable fishnets Angela Weiss / Getty Images 20th Century Fox Best known for playing Sophia on Orange Is the New Black and for her trans advocacy, Laverne Cox was the first Rocky Horror cast member announced to some controversy. Shell be playing Dr. Frank-N-Furter, the mad scientist played by Tim Curry in the film. While Frank is usually played by a male actor, the character has always reveled in gender fluidity that allows for some gender-bent casting.

McCartan will be playing Janets beau Brad (Barry Bostwick in the movie), a total square who like Janet is seduced by the absolute pleasure Frank offers. Frazer Harrison / Getty Images 20th Century Fox Reeve Carney originated the role of Spider-Man in the musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark. He somehow survived and went on to star as Dorian Gray on Showtimes Penny Dreadful. Carney will play Franks handyman Riff Raff, played by Rocky Horror creator Richard OBrien in the film.

aS'Trans sex workers in Olongapo, Philippines still dont disclose their trans status to clients, even though a U.S. Marine was recently convicted of killing a Filipina sex worker upon discovering she was trans. Since the conviction for the lesser charge of homicide locals are eager to reestablish normal relations with U.S. troops. But will sex workers remain vulnerable? Its close to midnight in early December on Waterfront Road in Olongapo, Philippines, which stretches along the waters edge where U.S. military vessels dock. Dimly lit by yellow tungsten lamps, womens figures in tight clothing short dresses or body-hugging jeans walk down the street, shadows covering their faces. The women tend to travel in small groups of two to six, as do larger figures that come into sight less frequently: foreign men, as it turns out, mostly white, a few black. There are rows of tiny lights on the ocean tonight, from a couple of U.S. military ships in the distance. At the Olongapo Hall of Justice the afternoon before, U.S. Marine Lance Corporal Joseph Scott Pemberton was sentenced to six to twelve years in Philippine prison for killing Jennifer Laude, a trans Filipina sex worker, in October 2014. His sentence was downgraded from the usual 20 to 40 years for homicide under Philippine law, in part because Laude failed to disclose to Pemberton that she was trans. The courthouse is two miles north of Waterfront Road along Rizal Avenue Extension, which turns into Manila Avenue after a bridge over the Kataklan River, but not before passing a roundabout that leads to Magsaysay Drive. There, in a motel near the end of the block, is where Pemberton choked Laude to unconsciousness, then dunked her head in the shallow water of a toilet until she died. Theres a hush after crossing the river now, as narrow streets full of people give way to broad avenues and wide sidewalks. This area used to be part of the Subic Naval Base, a major U.S. military facility that was closed in 1992, after a volcano eruption that resulted in widespread damage coincided with a wave of Philippine nationalism. The base was then converted into a tax- and duty-free commercial area called the Subic Bay Freeport Zone, with its U.S.-built facilities repurposed for commercial and business use. U.S. service members used to be able to roam around the area outside the former base during their leisure time, where a large number of bars, massage parlors, and other establishments that catered specifically to their needs awaited them. But since Laudes death last year, the U.S. military has confined service members to the Freeport, and its long stretch of bars and restaurants, right next to the ocean. Now, a young woman, with hair halfway down her back, walks alone on Waterfront, in tight jeans and a shirt with quarter-length sleeves. Her figure is slim and taller than most of the girls on the street. At the very end of the road, off to the side, is an area that the city has fitted with fluorescent streetlights but has yet to be developed. I take my customers there, the woman says in Tagalog as she gestures toward the darkness beyond the road, or we do it in their cars. Rose Ann claims shes 17, but her voice hasnt noticeably dropped. Her skin is dark, her face long and delicate, with a slightly upturned nose that gives her both a distinctive and proud appearance. Its doubtful that anyone would identify her as any different from other young Filipina girls, except maybe that shes taller and thinner than the norm. When asked if she knew Jennifer Laude, Rose Ann says that Laude once told her she was beautiful and asked her to hang out with her crew, but she felt too young and intimidated by sex work. She saw Laude at local hangouts every once in a while, but did not speak to her except for that one time. Rose Ann recalled that single interaction with the beguiling transgender woman who was dark like her after shed heard from a friend that she died. Even though Pemberton killed Laude after finding out that she was trans, Rose Ann insists that she needs to keep her transgender status from U.S. service members who pay her for sex. Why would I want to tell a man Im trans? she asks, aghast. I need to say Im a real woman or they wouldnt want me. Other trans sex workers, along with many locals and members of the LGBT community, confirm Rose Anns account: Trans sex workers in Olongapo keep their status secret from service members as a matter of course. These workers have operated in Olongapo even after Laudes death, taking businessmen from Korea, China, and other countries as customers when U.S. ships were prevented from docking there. In the verdicts aftermath, local officials and residents are eager for U.S. troops to come back and bring money into the city as they once did. The mayors office has convened a task force to prevent violent incidents involving trans women and U.S. military service members from occurring in the future, which encourages trans sex workers to disclose their trans status early on. But, because disclosing would inevitably lose them clients, theres little sign of meaningful change to the conditions that led to Laudes death at the hands of a U.S. military service member. For her part, Rose Ann exhibits a confidence beyond even her stated age. She asserts that what happened to Laude wont happen to her. I evaluate their character, she says, her chin jutting out defiantly as she discusses her customers. I only go with the gentlemen, and I only give blow jobs. I dont let them touch me down there. But Rose Ann also occasionally goes to motels with customers, where other trans workers have reported finding it more difficult to hide their status, as Laude did the night she died. Rose Ann says she makes sure to be near a phone so she can call in case theres trouble. According to a number of other trans women who saw her at the bar the night she and Pemberton met, Laude also took this precaution, and even made sure to bring a friend whenever she had a customer. On being informed of this, Rose Ann expresses a fatalism common in the Philippines, a country that is both deeply Catholic and prone to superstition. It was simply Jennifers hour, Rose Ann says. That was why she died.  View this image  Julita Laude with a picture of Jennifer. Meredith Talusan / BuzzFeed News Jennifers mother, Julita Laude, does not live in Olongapo, but in the far-flung province of Leyte. She took a ferry and a bus for more than 20 hours to see her daughters killer get convicted. She spends a quiet afternoon in her daughter Michelles apartment following the verdict, after enduring a battle with Pembertons camp the previous night about where the Marine would be detained following his conviction. That fight ended when Judge Roline Ginez-Jabalde ordered Pemberton to be housed at a military camp near the capital, separate from other Philippine prisoners but under local guard. Julita sits on a brown floral-print couch in Michelles modest one-bedroom duplex. Despite the conviction, she is far from satisfied, not just because of the short length of Pembertons sentence, but also because of the judges decision to keep Pemberton away from Philippine jail. We already know hes a killer, and he still gets special treatment, she says, her eyes welling up with tears. She also confides that there has been strife between her and Jennifers eldest sister, Marilou, over Julitas decision to use some of the money from Jennifers bank account to pay for renovations on her house in Leyte, where she lives with her second husband. Shes concerned about how the money from the judges verdict, about 4 million pesos, or around $100,000 a substantial sum by Philippine standards would affect her relationships with her children. Julitas face shifts from sadness to anger as she recalls another aspect of the case: the judges decision that Jennifers failure to disclose her trans status was a mitigating factor, which led to Pembertons lighter sentence. While Judge Ginez-Jabalde ruled that [t]here is no lawful aggression that justifies [Pemberton] to defend his honor, throwing out Pembertons claim that he acted in self-defense when he choked Laude, she also wrote, The mitigating circumstance of passion and obfuscation is present in this case. The familys head attorney, Harry Roque, later expressed his anger over this part of the verdict, asserting that Pembertons action was a hate crime against the LGBT community. Its like if I wore the mask of a younger woman then he killed me when he found out that I am old. Julita says. The judge wants to say its my fault. Its just not right. Laudes German fianc, Marc Sueselbeck, is also incensed at the verdict. He heard about Pembertons conviction only from Laudes family, as he is banned from entering the Philippines following an incident where he scaled a local military camp fence and was deported. But more than being angry, Sueselbeck is not entirely convinced that Pembertons testimony is true. Only two people know what happened in that room, Sueselbeck says over video chat from his home in Duisburg, Germany, as he smokes a cigarette. One of them wants to protect himself, and the other one is dead. View this image  Marc Sueselbeck Meredith Talusan / BuzzFeed News One detail that Sueselbeck finds particularly galling is the fact that a U.S. forensics expert testified to finding the same lubricant on Pembertons penis as was found on Laudes anus, indicating that the two engaged in anal sex. Yet there is no mention of anal sex in Ginez-Jabaldes verdict, as the court seems to have accepted the Marines testimony that he found out about Laudes status while she was performing oral sex on him. Its possible Jennifer didnt even want to have sex and he raped her, Sueselbeck says of Pemberton as he expands on his own theory of how Laude died. He might have known who she is even before they had sex, and killed her because he couldnt accept being rejected by a transgender woman. Jennifers former roommate Jamille was in Olongapo for the verdict but chose not leave her apartment, to avoid the chaos, and could be reached only by video chat. She was with Laude the night she died and claims to have had Jairn Rose Pembertons friend who testified in court that Pemberton told him he might have killed a he/she as her customer. Jamille, too, is dissatisfied with the verdict, and believes that Pemberton should have been convicted of murder and not homicide. America is still the favorite, Jamille says, a reference to the longstanding belief in Olongapo that U.S. citizens get special treatment in cases involving Filipinos, even in the Philippines. And there is still discrimination. If Jennifer were a real girl, the conviction would automatically be murder. (In the Philippines, its still common to refer to cisgender women as real in contrast to transgender women.) As for Laudes responsibility in disclosing her trans status, Jamille believes that Laude is partly at fault for not telling Pemberton shes trans, but doesnt believe this should have been a factor in lightening his sentence. Yes, it is our fault that we do not tell men we are not real women, and it is also our fault that we do this type of work, Jamille says. But that doesnt matter when life or death are at stake. At least Pemberton is alive; hes in jail, but still alive. Jennifer is dead. He should be jailed for life. View this image  Inside the Ambyanz Nightlife Discobar where Laude and Pemberton met. Meredith Talusan / BuzzFeed News Whether or not trans womens failure to disclose should be a factor in cases where they become victims of violence, theres no question that the practice leaves the workers in Olongapo vulnerable. Trans workers themselves have claimed that theyve been threatened or beat up when service members find out theyre trans and have been discouraged from pressing charges by local police, who have been instructed by national police authorities not to discuss the Laude case with reporters. However, many local residents are eager to move past the Laude incident altogether. Locals have even accused the Laudes of being selfish by not settling the case early. By having gone to trial, the liberty privileges for U.S. troops remained suspended, which in turn has directly led to hundreds, if not thousands, of locals losing their sources of income. The citys designated spokesperson on the Laude verdict, Olongapo City Councilor Aquilino Cortez Jr., emphasizes that the city has lost an estimated 20 million pesos (about $425,000) as a result of the U.S. suspension of off-base leisure activity in the area, as the absence of servicemen has led to loss of business from establishments as humble as corner stores and as large as retail brands in the local malls. Speaking outside his City Hall office, with his confident English and polished manner, Cortez echoes local sentiment in his eagerness to assert that Olongapo is ready to move on starting with normalizing relations with U.S. troops. We expect that liberty will resume now that Pemberton has been convicted, Cortez says, using the military term for service members leisure time off-base. We are working to address safety concerns when people like Jennifer Laude come into contact with servicemen. View this image  Outside Ambyanz. Meredith Talusan / BuzzFeed News Cortez is not perturbed about the downgrade in Pembertons sentence as a result of Laudes failure to disclose her status. He believes that any sentence, however long, is already a win for the Philippines, because, if Pembertons conviction holds up after his yet unscheduled appeal, it will be the first time that a U.S. service member would be successfully convicted of a crime against a Filipino citizen in a Philippine court. Another Marine, Daniel Smith, was convicted of raping a local woman, Suzette Nicolas, in 2006, but his conviction was overturned on appeal in 2009 after Nicolas recanted then left for the United States. The Smith case led to widespread speculation that U.S. authorities compelled Nicolas to recant in exchange for a U.S. visa. According to Cortez, the mayors office does not officially condone prostitution but is resigned to the reality that it is everywhere. A 2010 Philippine Senate Bill estimated that as of 2005, as many as 800,000 Filipinos engage in sex work nearly 1% of the population and the industry is concentrated in cities with large numbers of foreigners like Olongapo. I advise people to try to be honest with servicemen, Cortez says, like the culture in Thailand where it is known that when men come into contact with transgenders, they are who they say they are. Cortez bristles at the accounts of trans women who say they have few options because service members wouldnt go with them if they knew they were trans. These women also claim that they cant get jobs outside of sex work unless they dress as men, because local industries do not allow male-assigned individuals to dress in womens clothing. In a communication to the United Nations Human Rights Committee, a national transgender rights group reported that corporate and government offices in the Philippines have no cross-dressing policies that target transgender women. I dont understand this. Transgenders are respected in the beauty parlor business and the fashion industry, Cortez says, indicating two sectors where trans women are reported to be able to dress in womens clothes (though Laudes family claims that salon owners also forced her to dress in mens clothes). They shouldnt end up in situations where they pretend to be a real woman. Other locals express a mixture of sympathy and rejection when it comes to the presence of transgender sex workers in Olongapo. A souvenir vendor on Waterfront Road, Jerry Calubuhay, says that he is indifferent to the Pemberton verdict and wishes only that full liberty would resume so that ordinary people in Olongapo can have income. Ive never been in a situation where I find out that someone I am with is not a real woman, Calubuhay says. But of course you would react if that happened to you. You would think of your family and friends and how shameful it is that you are with a transgender. View this image  Taxi driver Ronald Troops Jr. Meredith Talusan / BuzzFeed Down the street from Calubuhays stand, a group of five taxi drivers stand by, waiting for customers even though the servicemen are confined to a walkable area and their services are hardly needed. That has nothing to do with us, one of them shouts when approached about the case. A female bystander sitting on a nearby park bench shouts back, Transgenders need to be kicked out of Olongapo. Another taxi driver replies: Your words hurt too much. Those are our fellow Filipinos. This is when Ronald Troops Jr., a light-skinned taxi driver a head taller than the rest, joins the conversation. If it were me, I would have killed her too, he asserts. [The Laude family] should take their money and stab it down their throats. There are so many families that have gone hungry because of their greed. Troops says that he is half American but he has never been able to locate his father, Ronald Sr., who was a service member based in Olongapo. He recounts his struggles trying to make a living as a taxi driver when service members are not allowed to leave the area. Suddenly, his mood turns calmer. I was only joking when I said I would have killed Jennifer, Troops says, balking. Transgenders are also Filipinos like us.  View this image  The gate that U.S. service members use to leave their ships and go onto Waterfront Road. Rose Ann is worried about people identifying her and finding out shes a sex worker. Her father doesnt know that she roams the streets looking for customers. Hes back in Manila, having sent Rose Ann to Olongapo with her mom to study at a good school. I dont want to bring dishonor to his family name, Rose Ann says. Nevertheless, she is clear about her desire to tell her story. Its important for people to know the life we live, and what we have to do to survive. Knowing that Pemberton is not going to jail for as long because Jennifer is trans, its like were not equal to other people. We need to be equal because we are equal. Her mother knows that Rose Ann hangs around bars and clubs in the area, but is not aware that she is doing sex work. According to the young woman, She thinks Im just looking for a handsome boyfriend who will take me to America. This is Rose Anns ultimate goal: to find a foreign man who will accept her for who she is and take her abroad, as Laudes fianc was prepared to do before she died. Laudes former roommate and close friend Jamille, for her part, seems on her way to fulfilling that goal, as her Canadian fianc John joins her over video chat, an older man who she met on the internet and has known for over a year. They are making plans to get married. Even before she and John decided that their relationship was serious, Jamille says that she had already curtailed her sex work, afraid of the consequences of revealing her status. But in terms of other trans women, she says, there hasnt been a real change. They still get customers who dont know theyre trans. Its the same as ever. According to Jamille, the only difference shes noticed is that taxi drivers and other locals are quicker to out them to foreigners. They would shout, Thats a ladyboy! and then the trans woman would run, Jamille says. John was not aware of Jamilles transgender status until late November, when she informed him after he came to Olongapo to visit her. Though Jamille says theyve been going through a period of adjustment in response to her revelation, John has come to accept her, and has continued making plans for their upcoming marriage, which would eventually allow her to immigrate to Canada. I was married for 44 years, John says. Before my wife died, she told me that as long as I find someone to love, it doesnt matter what or who, I should go for it. And thats what Im doing. Like modern fairy tales, stories like Jamilles give sex workers in Olongapo hope: hope of finding foreigners who will take them away from lives of poverty and struggle, even if the already small odds are even smaller for transgender women. As Rose Ann continues to roam the streets of Olongapo at night, she has to believe that she will encounter men like Jennifers and Jamilles fiancs, and not a man like the kind who ended Jennifers life.

aS"Its been a long year. View this image  View this image  A long-time opponent of same-sex marriage, advocates knew chances of legislating under Abbott were slim. He had shown no signs of granting a free vote on the issue to government MPs, meaning frontbenchers would face losing their jobs if they voted in favour of same-sex marriage.

Let me say, I enjoyed ALL the ladies & I had a great time filming multiple scenes with them! Unfortunately due to contractual complications + the magic of editing, you wont be seeing as much of me as expected. *whispers* (I dont work for free.

Im in my 20s and when this opportunity was BROUGHT to me, It was no guarantees & I was cool with that, but I wasnt going to exploit myself or act out of character for it I honestly saw a chance to help change the perspective of MY community, but I wanted to maintain my dignity. Housewife and Transgender arent words that are usually associated Funny, because anyone who knows me knows that being a housewife is a dream of mine, not on reality tv, but in real life.  View on Instagram But contrary to popular belief, I personally know transgender housewives, models, doctors, lawyers and many other successful unique individuals, along with so many others who are fighting to break the negative stigma associated with the trans community. Not to mention, a lot of our opportunities are limited due to discrimination and thats why most are forced into compromising occupations. But my point in this is to say, me filming with the #RealHousewivesOfAtlanta was not for attention, but to assist in breaking a stereotype. Trans women are not only sex objects or prostitutes. We are strong, educated & human just like everyone else. AND WE ARE HERE AND WE DEMAND RESPECT. And whatever I have to do to assist in that I will and wont regret it.

aS"When we lived in a co-op with 32 other people, my girlfriend and I were deeply in love. But some relationships work because they work, and some relationships work because of context and our relationship was the latter. View this image  Found art in a toilet block in Batemans Bay, Australia. Devi Lockwood The community of queer women in Harvards class of 2014 was tight almost claustrophobically so. By the time senior year rolled around, every Saturday night party organized by the Queer Students and Allies or outing to see Mary Lambert/Janelle Mone/Andrea Gibson perform in Boston brought with it the likelihood of bumping into my ex, my exs ex, or my best friends ex. Awkward turtles abounded. Sometimes I would double check with a mutual friend before going to see if a certain person I really didnt want to run into would be there. Sometimes I just went, because Mary Lambert is worth certain sacrifices. After one particularly difficult breakup junior year, I moved into the Dudley Cooperative House to rekindle my relationship with food. If theres one thing Ive come to know about myself, its that my stomach and my broken heart dont mix. Food nauseates me when I am anxious. The way to get around that is to put myself in the way of deliberately positive kitchen spaces to let food be a refuge, a source of community. I was one of 32 undergrads living in the house. We did all our own cooking and cleaning together and rotated chores on a biweekly basis. There was a walk-in fridge full of vegetables and more dried garbanzo beans than we ever had time to cook in one semester. I learned how to make bread, to soak kidney beans, and how to have difficult conversations about things like music volume and the type of cheese that we ordered in bulk. Senior fall, I started to date one of my housemates. She lived one floor below. We had voiced attraction to each other the summer before but didnt act on it then she moved in. I bumped into her for the first time since summer break when I was wrapped only in a towel en route to the shower, and then again in the kitchen as I made myself stir-fried veggies after rowing practice. We smiled and talked about our summers and made eye contact that lingered. One week later we celebrated the new semester with the rest of our housemates at the mixer, a party that moves from room to room. The night started with karaoke and margaritas on a ground floor bedroom with three walls covered in tin foil. Upstairs we wrote compliments for our 32 housemates on pieces of construction paper scotch-taped to our backs. Later we played life-size truth-or-dare Jenga with planks of wood (someone completed a naked lap outside the house), spun the bottle, and, finally, had a dance-off in the driveway that ended with a noise complaint from a neighbor. The bottle didnt spin in our direction, but my soon-to-be girlfriend and I lingered behind our housemates in the hallway and kissed. I loved how living in the co-op gave us shared spaces for intimacy. When I was washing the dishes in our industrial-size kitchen, my girlfriend would come up behind me and slide her hands around my hips. I melted into the soap. I looked forward to seeing her, to doing readings for class sitting next to each other in the alcove of sunlight near the front door. I loved sorting mail into her box when it arrived on the front stoop. On Sundays we made each other breakfast with heart-shaped slices of beetroot on top and, when the weather was nice, ate outside on the porch. The kitchen became an intimate space that I looked forward to in particular. I was in love, and we were surrounded by 32 other complex, vibrant, alive people going about their own business of cooking and living and loving and crying and writing papers and solving problem sets. If I needed to vent, someone was there to listen. In the co-op I was part of a support system that could hold me, no matter how complex and messy I felt. One thick April afternoon, one of my housemates came into the dining room in tears she and a long-term partner had just ended things. This housemate and I werent particularly close, but the three of us who happened to be in the room at the time leapt into action. One housemate gave her a hug; the other brought a pillow and stroked her hair. I went to the kitchen to make a pot of rooibos tea to share. Keep on crying for as long as you need, my housemate said. Were here for you. This is what community looks like. We give and we receive food and advice and stories. Graduation came and went. The birth-to-college map I had followed for so long burned into pieces. After all these years of structure, what was next? The cooperative house community dispersed. My former housemates moved into apartments with significant others in Somerville, Massachusetts, or went on to finance jobs in New York City or to tech paradise in San Francisco. My girlfriend and I accepted the same free housing gig in a cinder-block building in Harvard Law School. We shared a kitchen and several bathroom stalls with a hallway full of astrophysicists, none of whom I got to know by name. Our job was to hand out sheets and towels and to be on call if anyone locked themselves out of the building. My girlfriend and I stopped kissing in the kitchen there wasnt any space, and what if one of the astrophysicists walked in? When one of us had a bad day at work, we would come home to a conversation with a support network of one, rather than a support network of 32. Theres only so much that one person can do. Early on in the relationship, I held my lover in my arms and let myself imagine the sweet forevers the apartment with a tomato vine on the windowsill grad school, family Thanksgivings, our lives intertwined. We could tell the story of how we met as something certain, a well from which to draw buckets of comfort year after year: the perfect domestic bliss. What happens when those forevers take flight into a Boston summer sunset, over the Copley building gone? I grew frustrated with her. We fought over mundane things, our voices staccato and an octave higher than usual. The cinder-block walls echoed our arguments. Which was all a way of articulating: I want a kind of love and safety and support that you cannot give. Some relationships work because they work, and some relationships work because of context. Our relationship was the latter. Place determines the kinds of interactions you can have in that place. Outside of the cooperative house, outside of that temporary stability of senior year, we couldnt be together. We broke up in a boil-over rage one Tuesday at 9 p.m. So were breaking up, then. Thats it? Thats it. Teary and directionless, I walked outside and met an old friend. We climbed the steps of Widener Library and looked across the quadrangle of grass, purplish in the night, to the steps of Memorial Church. Convocation was held there some four years ago, back before we made a mess of things by loving one another. I didnt know it then, but in a little more than a year, one of my rowing teammates would get married on those steps. My friend put her head on my shoulder, her arm around my back. Her octopus tentacle earring dug into my clavicle, but I didnt want to move. When I dried my eyes enough to look up, the clouds looked like little islands I could hop between. Can I do this? Love and safety and structure seemed as far away as those clouds. For three arduous weeks, my ex and I were still living next door to each other. I stopped eating regularly because I was nervous that we would run into each other in the kitchen. Her eyes could kill. People complimented me as I lost weight. I felt like I was disappearing. I didnt want to disappear I had just forgotten how to eat. It is virtually impossible to hide from your millennial ex on the internet, but I did find refuge. I met up with 30-year-old queers who had nothing to do with my college through the Autostraddle Boston community. They too had survived heartbreaks. We went to Shakespeare in the Park and ate crackers with pesto while sitting on checkered blankets. I slept on their couches on the nights I wasnt on call in the dreaded dorm building where my ex slept and ate. I house-sat for a travel writer and her orange cat. I said goodbye to Boston. The key is first breathing onto the scoop of the utensil, darling. Lindy and I sat across from each other at a rickety table on her porch. Dense vines twined around the railings. The air was dense with Southern Hemisphere summer February 2015. I cycled here from Auckland. Yes! Yes, thats it. The spoon adhered to my nose for half a second before falling to the porch floor. I picked it up and tried again. Breathe a little more condensation onto it next time. Lindy took a deep sip of lemongrass tea and exhaled, long and smooth into the afternoon. Lindy, I ask, how did you and Murray meet? She paused, teaspoon in hand, and closed her eyes while she stuck the spoon to her nose. At a Shakespeare meet-up, dear. Friends of friends introduced us. It was only a few years ago. Lindy and Murray grow fruit together on the outskirts of Whanganui, New Zealand, and distill the sweetness into kefir. Their love for each other seeps through the trees. I gave Lindy a botched history of my own love life, because that is what you do while learning to carry a spoon on your nose. Being a queer woman among a small community of queer women at university brings its own set of messes. Its a relief to be so far away from all that now. Lindys spoon finally clattered to the table. We both laughed. Its not a failure to end a relationship when its its time to end, Lindy said, matter-of-factly. The failure is in not learning something from that. And you loved! That itself is something worth celebrating. My favorite question to ask couples: How did you meet? Gorgeous stories bubble to the surface: Drunk at a bar she was stuffing french fries into a keyhole. Our friends introduced us and it just fit. We sat down at a restaurant and realized that we both wanted a family, that we were done with dating. Two love stories are never the same. August 2015: I rode my bicycle to the grocery store in a coastal town in Queensland, Australia, to buy an avocado. I was about to swing my leg over the top tube when a blonde woman with a Canadian accent smiled and said, Hey, you must be on a big bike tour! Five minutes later I rode to her house. We stayed up late sharing stories of water births and woke up mid-morning to tend the garden, mounding dirt over potato sprouts. We rode our bikes to a wildlife reserve and parked by a tree to walk. The path wound through a paperbark forest surrounded by swamp. Our steps covered wooden planks and stepping stones tall cylinders of concrete that would be almost submerged in the wet season. That August the ground was dry, dry. There was less than a foot of rainwater in the tank. We took short showers. Twenty years ago, I traveled from Canada to Osaka to work as a ski instructor and English teacher, Peg said to the trees. I lived in a 13th-floor apartment in the city. One day I opened the door and stared straight into the most gorgeous blue eyes attached to the most gorgeous man I have ever seen. That guy was Pete, who later said that when he saw Peg, his tongue rolled out across the floor and he had to roll it back up again before he could talk to her. Pete had a dream two years before this chance meeting on the 13th floor. In his dream a woman was walking down the beach with a child in each hand. When he saw Peg, he knew that she was that woman. In October 2014, the morning I left Los Angeles for Fiji, I opened up my Facebook feed. One of my rowing teammates from university, whos now in medical school, is getting married. The groom? Her lacrosse-playing boyfriend, who will soon join the Army. In their photos they look like Barbie and Mr. Athletic Savior of Our Nation. Their photos were taken on the very steps where I mourned my heartbreak last July. My teammate is 23. My mom gave birth to me when she was 24. My best friends mom was married at 23. I am 23. Why would someone voluntarily commit to an early onset of domesticity? For a millisecond, I was painfully jealous. I long, sometimes, for domestic stability. The longing creeps up at odd moments: when I am cycling under a viaduct in New Zealand or setting up the tent I now call home. I want a tomato plant. I want a sunny porch. I want four walls and a lover to come home to. I want a landline telephone and Boston snow. To still want these things is terrifying. I am a solo female touring cyclist. I define myself in motion. I am tethered to no one but myself. I dont want to get married. I want to be the peripatetic person, the writer, I am becoming. My longing for the stability of a home, a garden, and a relationship is, in the end, half-baked. Domesticity is something I do desire slightly, but not enough to follow the map. A year and a half ago I broke up with a person and a place at the same time. The finality of ending things with my girlfriend, with a city I love set me free. After all this time, Im learning to let myself yearn. Im learning that unresolved yearnings are a truth of human life. I burned my maps, and I have more regrets, possibly, than I would if I had followed them. Burning a map opens me to more feeling, not less. But thats OK, isnt it? Pain is livable. I burned my maps in search of wonder, in search of the worlds wild beauty. And here I am, floating on two tires of air, learning to love myself in motion. I am alive in the mess of being free in the grasp of the unknown. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .  Tagged:breakups, lgbt, travel Hey!

aS"You asked, they answered. View this image  I have always felt non-binary identified but I didnt have the words until I was about 23. I had no idea that non-binary people existed. I had no words to contextualize my experiences. So, my entire life has been spent being confused about my gender identity until I finally happened upon the words and happened upon other people like myself. View this image  I feel like I do? Oh, probably my mom. I grew up with a very fashionable mother. She was always playing around with jewelry and shoes and is obsessed with makeup, and clothing, and fashion. I grew up around that and got to see whats awesome and fun about expressing your personality through fashion. Other than that, I just generally look for what resonates with me. I love Willow and Jaden Smith also, theyre really rad. Brad Barket Getty Confidence is something that I work at every single day. It does not come naturally and it does not come easily. Even when I know things about myself to be true. I know that I am loved and I know that I am enough and that I am great I dont always feel that way. Sometimes I have to work myself up into feeling that way. It takes a lot of practice and its a very personal journey. Its something that I have to find within myself and pull out of myself every single day. View this image  For me, I have much less dysphoria now than I have previously in my life only because Ive come to a point where Im like alright: physical characteristics mean nothing in relation to gender and no matter what I look like, no matter what my body looks like, no matter what clothes I wear Im still agender and that needs to be respected. But everyones dysphoria is different and everyone has different levels of dysphoria. My experience is not everyone elses experience so thats a very tricky question to answer. View this image  Do little things just for yourself if you can. If youre not allowed to express my gender in the ways that you see fit try and find safe haven in the privacy of your bedroom, find safe haven wherever you can possibly take it. If that means painting your nails for the night and having to take off the nail polish in the morning, if having your nail painted for even that amount of time provides you with some solace you should absolutely do that for yourself. Find little things that make you happy; find little things that make you feel OK. For sure Laverne Cox and Janet Mock is great too. They are brilliant. They, I think Laverne especially, stradles the line so well between being a mainstream media icon and doing amazing trans activist work. That is something I also strive to do. Dimitrios Kambouris / Getty Images View this image  There are a lot of things I hate hearing. Your pronouns are grammatically incorrect. Or, I hate when people assume that I want to eliminate gender. Tyler is alway stalking about being non-binary and they just want to get rid of gender. I absolutely dont want to get rid of gender. I just want the space to identity how I identify and I want everyone to have the freedom to identify how they identify. I want them to express their genders in a way that suits them. I dont want to get rid of gender, I just want every single person to be able to express their gender without facing violence or harassment. View this image  Safety is always your number one priority. If you cannot come out because it is not safe for you, you do not have to come out. Please, please always take care of yourself first. I know a lot of people have so much anxiety about coming out and they feel pressure to there is so much connotation with braveness and coming out. Thats totally false, everyone is brave in their own particular way. Whether you come out or dont come out is a personal choice. Everyone has a different life and has to go through different things. Keep yourself as safe as possible, and I know thats not always on you. Generally, other people need to be responsible and step up to the plate for your safety but remember that anything that you do and how you identity is always valid and there are people who support you like me!

aS"Behind the scenes, including exclusive set photos, of the highly anticipated second season of The Outs, a web series newly picked up by Vimeo about 20something gay guys just trying to figure it all out. The Outs showrunner and star Adam Goldman is in full-fledged boss mode while filming outside Sid Golds Request Room, a blink-and-youll-miss-it piano bar off W. 26th St. in Manhattan. He readies equipment, fine-tunes lighting and framing, rounds up fellow talent Sasha Winters, Mark Junek, and William DeMeritt and he even puts this unsuspecting reporter to work. Its a 7pm bar exterior shoot in early November, and while its unseasonably warm, rush hour foot traffic abounds. Youre sure you dont mind? Goldman sincere, but understandably preoccupied asks as executive producer Vaughn Schoonmaker (of Michael Uries Cocktails & Classics) ushers me to the scenes background. There, we nonchalantly redirect passersby from stepping through the shoot, so expect a background talent cameo from yours truly. (Nobody gets to come to the set for free everybodys gotta work, costar and Brooklyn-based photographer Hunter Canning later jokes.) Working alongside director of photography Jay Gillespie, Goldman jumps fluidly from setting the scene, getting his lines out, and checking the take. Here, his character, Mitchell, is chatting alone with his best friend Oonas new beau, Kevin (DeMeritt, The Normal Heart). It seems a stiff encounter. Mitchell is reliably dry, bristling slightly in response to this unfamiliar company. But when the cameras done rolling, Goldman is a cool customer precise, certainly, but patient, adept, and confident. The 30-year-old sports Mitchells trademark wide-framed glasses and one of his many cardigans (this one grey with a thick, high collar). The one magical aspect of this show is that Mitchell never repeats a cardigan, so Ive been gearing up, Goldman says with a laugh. View this image  The cast of The Outs Erin Shipley for BuzzFeed News Its fast-approaching three years since we last heard from Mitchell and his brassy, blonde bestie, Oona (Winters, Eat Our Feelings). Subsequently, cast and crew are notably excited tonight, and with good reason. This is their fifth week filming The Outs much-anticipated second season, which officially returns as part of Vimeos first slate of original programming in early 2016. If youre a millennial gay man, you know why this is a big deal. Pegged with the tagline, Just because its over doesnt mean youre over it, The Outs is the story of Mitchell and Jack (Canning, Shades of Blue), longtime boyfriends who are on the, well you know. At the series onset, Mitchells unsuccessfully dating while Jack (lean, curly-haired, and mischievous) is successfully bedding just about anyone. Theyre broken up and spiteful, only speaking when its to unearth old grievances and land a jab (Blue makes you look desperate.). But through the course of its seven episodes, we see them navigate new loves and friendships while trying to regenerate something of a friendship of their own. The hit Web series set the blogosphere ablaze upon its spring 2012 premiere thanks to its candid, unconventional, and wonderfully written take on 20something gay life in the big city. Its hard to say its huge, Goldman says.Its not TV huge. Its barely Internet huge. Its niche huge. Niche, sure, but niche creeping on cult. Goldmans audience was so fervent for more of The Outs that all episodes after its pilot were crowd funded via Kickstarter before premiering on theouts.com. Wrapping April 3, 2012, with 49 backers pledging $1,685, The Outs first campaign funded the second and third episodes, Whiskey Dick and Moon River. Those spots gained enough traction that its second campaign in July 2012 had 503 backers pledging $22,339 nearly triple its $8,000 goal to fund episodes 47. Goldman had even greater success with his second Brooklyn-based project, Whatever this is., in July 2013. Starring many familiar faces from The Outs, this Web series raised $171,447 with 2,174 backers. Posing the question, How long do you have to hate what you do before you get to do what you love? Whatever this is. follows a down-on-their luck group of friends who work together as reality TV PAs. Its six episodes continue to showcase unique queer perspectives, namely through its protagonist, Ari (Dylan Marron of Every Single Word). Theres little doubt Goldmans ability to create these queer narratives is what inspired his dedicated following. At the time [of The Outs], every queer person on TV, for the most part, was a white gay man in his 40s in California considering adoption, Goldman reflects while switching out for a sleeker pair of glasses. It was The New Normal, Modern Family [The Outs] just came at a time pre-Looking when people were starved for a representation of themselves, as we always are. Thats not to say that The Outs is representative of the entire queer community thats crazy. No show is representative of the entire straight community. Its an important distinction to make. Admittedly, those who would find explicit representation in The Outs tend to be of a certain subset of gay: white, male, late-20s Brooklynite. In the case of this second season, it was more like, These are our core characterslets build the world around them with all of that in mind, trying to make that as diverse as possible, Goldman says. View this image  Adam Goldman (right) Erin Shipley for BuzzFeed News Criticisms to that end aside, The Outs has still struck a special chord with audiences looking for a less stereotypical depiction of gay life. Though there are other notable gay web series today, it manages to stand out in part because many of its contemporaries have a weighted fixation on the gay mans libido, for better or worse. The latest season of Eastsiders, for instance, hinges on its protagonist couple opening their relationship. With Hunting Season, its all in the name. And a hit with queer ladies, Be Here Nowish, explores polyamory and similar sexual territory, but more as it relates to spiritual awakening and New Age philosophy. The Outs takes a humanistic approach to gay living. The series deals with sex, for sure (Mitchell broke up with Jack after catching him mid-coitus with another man, after all), but its characters sex drives take a backseat to their friendships, their jobs, their love lives beyond the bedroom. From the start, viewers get invested in more than dramatics of whos sleeping with whom. With Season 2, Goldman is attempting to strike gold again. Last we saw The Outs Brooklyn family was its seventh installment a Chanukah Special in April 2013. Surplus Kickstarter funds allowed the indie series to come to a satisfying, 45-minute close. After a season of heartache, Mitchell and Jack were on the platonic mend; Jack was dating and living with the adorable Scruffy (Tommy Heleringer), who just got accepted to grad school in Iowa; Mitchell and Oona, recovering from a major fallout, took the first steps toward fixing their broken friendship; and Mitchell himself was getting back in the dating game. It was funny because the show was really over for a long time, Goldman says. I was so happy with the ending and I thought it was a concluded story. Then Vimeo came knocking. Considering The Outs and Whatever this is., they ultimately optioned Goldmans first brainchild. I originally was like, Why? Whats the point? That shows over, Goldman admits. [Then] the more I thought about it, making another season right on the heels of the first one felt kind of bullshitty to me, but waiting three years felt like an appropriate time to check in with these characters and see what they were up to. Lets see how much they had changed. Change is inevitable, but good luck trying to get Goldman to tell you about it. Despite Season 2s secrets being under lock and key, heres whats known: Oona and Mitchell are speaking again (and hitting Sid Golds for some double date food and drink); Oonas landed a book deal for her irreverent and obnoxious wine blog, Wine Wine Wine, and finds herself in what Goldman calls a risky relationship; Mitchell is dating a hunky blonde named Rob (Junek) who has a penchant for song and dance; and mums the word on Jack and Scruffy, who wrapped Season 1 with a cliffhanger audiences are still biting their nails over. Lord knows not everyones built for long distance! Im being so vague because I really like to keep that stuff secret, Goldman says apologetically. What I can say is: Everyones getting laid at the start of the season. He goes on to say that an apropos tagline for Season 2 would be just the opposite of the last: Just because youre over it, doesnt mean its over. Revisiting Sid Golds the following afternoon, Goldman promises a hell-of-a day, and it doesnt disappoint. A sizable amount of extras joins cast members new and old for the bustling interior shoot, one Goldman says is the series most ambitious yet. While many grab a barstool and chow on Chipotle along the front rooms main bar, Goldman is all movement in the back. He uses his lunch break to prep for an afternoon of smooth sailing by checking in with actors, crew, extras, and press. Such attentiveness continues, too, when the cameras roll, making for a productive and thoughtful work environment that his actors relish. Adams in his element when hes on set because his brain works like a director, like a writer, like an actor. I marvel watching him orchestrate and be able to engage on every level, Heleringer, who plays Scruffy, tells me later by phone. (Hes mysteriously absent from this Sid Golds shoot, which may mean the worst for him and Jack. Justice for Scruffy!) View this image  Erin Shipley for BuzzFeed News Sitting in a booth across the way, however, are Winters and Canning, the former rocking a business bob and little black dress; the latter a dark blue button-up, sleeves rolled to his elbows. Its been totally thrilling and unexpected. Its awesome, Winters, whose Web series Eat Our Feelings recently won a Streamy for Best Indie, says of The Outs return. It was in the works for awhile; [Vimeo and Goldman] were talking about it for a long time. Im always waiting for it to fall apart or not happen, but then it did! Its go time. I love that we can just get the band back together and not have to Kickstart this time, Canning adds. I think the name inherently suggests that Kickstarter shouldnt be your sustainability model, right? Youre supposed to get something going and then it either flies or it doesnt. Sitting between them today is quite the special guest: none other than three-time Emmy nominee Alan Cumming, who snuck away from filming The Good Wife to resurrect his memorable Chanukah Special cameo. The seasoned Scot actor is a longtime Outs devotee. He first tweeted his love for the series in September 2012, then came on to play an exaggerated version of himself in the Season 1 finale. Hes back today for a quick turn in episode four. I think the wit of it struck me first, the way that it manages to be so funny and insightful and at the same time not fall into using any easy clichs about the people in it, Cumming says of his initial fondness for the show. Most of all, I think I loved the heart of it how tender it was about getting to know yourself and just existing in this big tough world. That is especially where it is head and shoulders above so many other shows that tell stories of young urban types. Of working with Goldman, Cumming continues: I think he is such a funny, clever, and kind boy and one of the most talented writer-directors I have worked with. On set he is always concerned and caring of everyone, but also always able to spout a pithy bon mot. This skill is made particularly clear while inside the piano bar. Goldman is juggling extras, cast mates, crew, and Cumming, but he keeps his cool, saying hes confident the hours on set are paying off. Visually, its going to really knock peoples socks off, he assures, nodding to director of photography Gillespie and crediting the newfound production value to Vimeo. With any luck, scenes of this magnitude will become old hat for Goldman after The Outs Vimeo On Demand premiere. Remember: it was just earlier this year that Vimeos first original web series, High Maintenance, was picked up by HBO. At the very least, the move to the streaming service ensures greater visibility and a wider audience. By all counts, Goldman is up for the prospect. However you date now in a major city or elsewhere, your ex is still in your phone, and youre still friends with them on Facebook, and youre still following them on Twitterthe show is really about how people dont fully leave your life the way that we want them to or the way that they used to be able to, he says. As a writer, I hope that it emotionally resonates with people on that level, and [Im] also just happy to provide another source of queer-centric entertainment for people. I feel like we need it. I wish the show had been around before and I wish the show was done so I could just fucking watch it now. But unfortunately, weve got to finish making it.

aS'The story of how a group of trans women vanished in the midst of El Salvadors civil war has been passed down from generation to generation, creating a legend that gave them a place in the history of a country that often seems to wish they would disappear. BuzzFeed News J. Lester Feder set out to document the mysterious incident for the first time. SAN SALVADOR La Cuki Alarcn was late to work on the night that his roommate disappeared, which is why he is still around to tell what happened. His hair was extravagantly curled, and he matched a long skirt with high boots, a look he hoped hid his legs, which he thought looked too manly to appeal to his clients. Alarcn was hurrying to the strip they used to work across the street from El Salvadors national symbol, the Divine Savior of the World monument, a statue of Jesus with his feet planted on a globe perched atop a column about 60 feet in the air. Work was so steady on that corner that Alarcn thought a client might have already picked up his roommate and the other locas they hung out with. Outsiders called them all homosexuals, but the sex workers some who lived as women all the time, others who dressed as women primarily on the job called each other crazies even though some used it as an insult that would roughly translate to sissy. (Alarcn asked BuzzFeed News to refer to him using male pronouns.) As Alarcn reached the opposite corner, he could see his friends were still there. He hesitated for a minute before crossing because the stoplight was out, and thats when he realized the locas were not alone. Four tall men in ski masks were throwing them into the back of a green truck, clubbing them with the butts of their guns. View this image  Harvey Meston / Getty Images Alarcn remembers the year as 1980, a time when death squads were using trucks like this one to make people disappear by the hundreds every week. This was the beginning of the civil war that consumed El Salvador until 1992. The United Nations, NGOs, journalists, and scholars have sought to uncover what happened to many of the more than 75,000 who were killed or disappeared during the conflict, but no one has ever investigated what happened to Alarcns friends. As far as anyone knows, no one has even recorded their names among the missing. But Alarcn can still rattle off the names of many of the dozen he remembers being thrown into the truck that night. There was his roommate Cristi, whom he remembers as a gentle 26-year-old who would bring him gifts of coats or shoes from trips shed frequently make to Guatemala and Mexico. Another was Vernica, from San Bartolo near the Honduran border, who was so pretty that her clients would sometimes insist on having their pictures taken with her. Carolina was so well put together that shed sometimes get into trouble she looked all woman, Alarcn said, and her clients could get violent when they discovered she was trans as she undressed. Alarcn is one of the only witnesses to their disappearances who is still alive, but the story of that night is well-remembered. It has been passed down from generation to generation of trans sex workers in the countrys capital, San Salvador. Its been retold so many times it can sometimes be hard to separate fact from legend, passed down in the same way many families retell the haunting mysteries that still linger from the war. The tale stakes a claim for trans women in a country that often seems to wish they would disappear. Maybe there still could be some justice for us, right? Alarcn said during an interview in San Salvador last December. Maybe remembering everything that happened to these friends can bring some peace for all homosexuals? View this image  Patricia Leiva and La Cuki Alarcn in Leivas house J. Lester Feder / BuzzFeed News I first learned about this story from a 38-year-old Salvadoran trans activist named Karla Avelar in the fall of 2014 while working on a story about LGBT kids fleeing the country to make the dangerous, illegal trip to the United States. El Salvador has some of the highest rates of anti-LGBT violence in the hemisphere, and Avelar recounted waves of unpunished murders over the past several decades. In 2014 alone, at least 12 women and two gay men were killed, according to media reports. There was the Bloody June of 2009 in which at least three trans women and two gay men were murdered. Avelar herself survived being shot in the 1990s by a serial killer who had been gunning down trans sex workers. The ones taken from the Savior of the World were almost mythical to Avelar, who was a baby when the events occurred. We dont even really know much ourselves, but a little while ago one of the survivors told us what happened and said to us, Why dont you document this, that I was a victim of that attack? she said. But the task seemed impossible. There is no documentation whatsoever, no publication nor record there is nothing. Avelar knew of just one witness who still survived, a woman named Paty who she said was 78 years old, a miracle in a country where violence and HIV are so widespread very few trans women survive to middle age. I flew to El Salvador as soon as I could. Patys health sounded fragile and if she died before her memories could be recorded, any hope of documenting the atrocity would die with her. I decided to work with Nicola Chvez Courtright, co-founder of a small organization documenting the history of El Salvadors LGBT movement called AMATE, hoping she would have ideas on how to start substantiating Patys memories. When we visited Paty whose full name is Patricia Leiva shortly before Christmas last year, we learned that much of what Avelar told me was wrong. Leiva was only 60, though it was understandable why Avelar had thought she was much older. Health problems had swollen her stomach like a basketball and made it nearly impossible for her to walk. She also had not been there on the night of the disappearances from the Savior of the World, and years of heavy drinking meant she could only recall bits and pieces of the story, despite having heard it countless times. Leiva lives in the remains of what used to be a popular beer hall called the Bluegill in a once-thriving red-light district called the Praviana, now subdivided into tenements. The bar had belonged to La Cuki Alarcn, Leiva told us, and he had been there that night. Alarcn is now retired and lives in the suburbs, surviving with help from his children who live in the United States. Alarcn doesnt routinely go by La Cuki (a Spanish spelling of Cookie) anymore, preferring his male name. But he asked that we not publish his legal first name because he was worried about his safety for talking about the war. Besides, he said, La Cuki had been my nomme de guerre my homosexual one. Alarcn hid from the men rounding up his friends that night by throwing himself to the ground in a small garden. He tried to slink away after watching the men pile his friends into the truck, but more armed men were patrolling the surrounding streets. He remembered making it to the La Religiosa funeral home up the block, where he tried to take sanctuary, but he said the guard wouldnt let him in because there was a lavish wake underway There are only famous people in there, the guard told him. So he waited out the raid crouched between the cars parked outside. When the coast was clear, he went back to work on the corner. Within minutes, a client had come and picked him up. Alarcn figured hed see Cristi in a day or two, which is how long the cops usually held sex workers after a routine vice raid. But Cristi never came home. None of them did. Alarcn went to the police stations to try to find her. He even hired a lawyer. But the cops made fun of him and hinted that his friends were already dead. They said that they had dressed them up as soldiers and made them play war, he remembered. El Salvadors 12-year civil war had its roots in political battles that had been going on for half a century. In 1980 it blew up into one of the last and bloodiest conflicts of the Cold War. That year, military leaders ousted moderates in the ruling junta while paramilitary squads aligned with the regime hunted down government critics. The war vaulted into international headlines in March, when the head of the countrys Catholic Church, Archbishop scar Romero, was shot through a church doorway while he was celebrating mass. The U.S. government threw tremendous weight behind the military leaders even as the body count grew, and a rebel force called the Farabundo Mart National Liberation Front fought back with a little support from Nicaragua and Cuba. Echoing the early days of Vietnam, Washington sent in military advisers, contributed tens of millions of dollars in military aid, and trained Salvadoran troops at an installation in Panama known as the School of the Americas. The U.S. continued this support even after reporters for the Washington Post and New York Times uncovered that a U.S.-trained battalion was responsible for one of the wars most infamous atrocities, the extermination of an entire farming village called El Mozote in 1981. View this image  The shallow grave of U.S. nuns exhumed in 1980 in front of 15 reporters and the U.S. ambassador to El Salvador, Robert White. Christine Spengler / Sygma / Corbis The two sides were locked in a stalemate as the Cold War came to an end with the Soviet Unions collapse. Peace accords signed on Jan. 16, 1992, made uncovering the crimes committed during the war a cornerstone of rebuilding the nation, creating a Truth Commission run by the United Nations to gather witness statements and write a definitive account of the wars greatest atrocities. Because many of the wars abuses were so extensively documented in that process, we thought we might find some record of the disappearances from the Savior of the World. But we came up empty. Our best hope was the archives of the two human rights offices run by San Salvadors Catholic Archdiocese the most active human rights monitors during the war but they could locate no records matching the case. They might have been able to search more if we could provide the victims legal names, but Alarcn and the others we spoke with only knew them by their female names. We had hoped that El Salvadors oldest gay rights organization, Entre Amigos, would be able to help us substantiate these memories. When it organized the countrys first pride march in 1997, the group declared it as a commemoration of another event said to have happened during the war years: the abduction of a number of trans women from the heart of the Praviana red-light district by a U.S.-trained battalion in June 1984. This is the one case of crimes against LGBT people claimed to have been recorded by human rights monitors during the war. Entre Amigos co-founder William Hernndez told us in an interview that he had uncovered a statement from a witness to that incident while working in the archive of an organization called the Nongovernmental Human Rights Commission just after the wars end. But, Hernndez said, the account was so confusing and incomplete that, when examined from a legal point of view, it wouldnt give me anything that argues that this was real. He initially said that he would be glad to dig it out of the groups files for us anyway, but he grew increasingly combative when we attempted to follow up. Finally, he sent us a note saying his lawyers did not trust how the information will be managed and requested that we remove reference to Entre Amigos from this story. So we went directly to the Nongovernmental Human Rights Commission, and they told us they could not locate any such testimony in its archives. None of the people we interviewed said theyd witnessed an abduction as described by Entre Amigos or knew of anyone who had. If the testimony existed and it was as mixed up as Hernndez described, theres the possibility that the person was describing the disappearances from the Savior of the World and some of the details got scrambled in the retelling, including the year. And we could never pin down the date of the disappearances for sure. Its not uncommon for people to have difficulty remembering dates from the war years even when loved ones died, the violence was so unrelenting that the number on a calendar seemed like a fairly meaningless abstraction in daily life, other reporters who covered the conflict told us. Calendar dates might even be especially hard for the trans women we interviewed, most of whom didnt finish elementary school because they were thrown out by their families once their femininity became apparent. The witnesses we interviewed mostly gave dates ranging from 1978 to 1980, but the fall of 1980 seems likeliest. One person who lived in the Praviana at the time told us she remembered they were still searching for the missing when one of the most notorious killings of the war took place: the rape and murder of three American nuns and a laywoman by the National Guard on Dec. 2, 1980. View this image  U.S. nuns killed by members of the Salvadoran National Guard on Dec. 2, 1980 during the civil war. Jose Cabezas / Reuters / Corbis This timing may be confirmed by something we found while paging through three years of newspapers from the period, held in dusty binders in the collection of San Salvadors Museum of Anthropology. The only announcement for an event at the La Religiosa funeral home we found was published by both major dailies, El Diario de Hoy and La Prensa Grfica, on Oct. 1, 1980. It was for a man who had died in Los Angeles, California, whose remains had been shipped home for burial, suggesting he may have been from a wealthy or important family. Alarcn remembers the wake where he tried to hide from the raid as being especially fancy, so theres a possibility this was it. Thats not a lot to go on, but two days later, El Diario de Hoy reported that police were leading sweeps to purge those elements that are undesirable to society in response to recent thefts. The operation was reportedly focusing on a park about two miles away from the Savior of the World though close to the Praviana but the next day La Prensa Grfica quoted police saying the effort was expanding to target other sites known as refuges for criminals. It may be hard to imagine a dozen people could disappear without attracting some attention. But at that point in the war, unexplained deaths had become so routine that it was remarkable when anyone raised a fuss. (And these were sex workers trans ones at that the kind of people whom many would probably have been happy to see cleared off the streets if they noticed them at all.) Bodies were being dumped at a rate of more than 150 a week, which the U.S. Embassy would tally in regular Violence Week in Review cables, even as the U.S grew closer with the El Salvadoran regime. Remains were found scattered around the capital every morning, sometimes with their faces destroyed so they could not be identified or left in a spot where vultures could be counted on to scatter their bones. Trucks like the ones Alarcn saw at the Savior of the World were icons of the inescapable violence. The death squads victims were killed in the usual fashion, reported a cable from the U.S. Embassy to Washington of the 179 people who died in the week ending Nov. 28, 1980: Kidnapped by a group of armed men who appeared as civilians, taken away in the ubiquitous pick-up trucks, shot or strangled or both, and then dumped along roadsides. Six of that weeks murders included top opposition leaders that attracted some outcry, the cable noted, but their deaths were unusual in that they have gone noticed. If news of the death of a group of sex workers had reached officials at the U.S. embassy or human rights organizations, it could have easily been ignored as an extreme vice raid rather than as a political crime. But those who lost their friends believe they died because of politics. The most intriguing part of the legend of the disappearances from the Savior of the World and the part that is probably the most impossible to pin down is that they were killed to cover up a government secret. They were taken that night, the story goes, in a hunt for two sex workers who had evidence of a crime. Evidence they had stolen from an American. View this image  El Salvadors Monument to Memory and Truth. J. Lester Feder / BuzzFeed News Some of the locas thought the American was a diplomat, while others believed he was a reporter. No one really knew why he was in the country, but they all knew what he looked like. The ones we spoke to who had seen him recalled that he appeared to be in his fifties with close-cropped white hair and a mustache or a goatee. He was a big spender who always hired two at a time one for him to make love to while the other made love to him, one person told us. The two he picked up shortly before the raid stole his briefcase. Inside were some cameras that the locas believed had been used to photograph some kind of a government crime. All this might be easily shrugged off as the kind of conspiracy theory that proliferates in wartime, except several sources said theyd heard it from people directly involved. La Cuki Alarcn said the American came to his bar offering a reward to get his cameras back. Another sex worker, who asked not to be named, said shed been warned that a hunt for the thieves was underway by a sergeant in the National Guard who was her regular client. Several told us that one of the thieves had a wife, a cisgender woman named Sonia who lived in San Salvador for at least another 30 years and would sometimes talk about how the authorities eventually dug the briefcase out of her patio with the cameras still inside. Everyone believes both thieves escaped, but there are a lot of different stories about what happened to the ones who disappeared beneath the Savior of the World: They were tortured by having their fingernails pulled out and their breasts shorn off. They were dragged to death by horses at the infantry barracks. They were dumped in a hole on the road to the notorious Mariona prison. Their families tried to find them. A woman named Yazmn Zulema Enrquez, whose mother did laundry in a Praviana brothel, told us how relatives of the missing would come for help with their search. She remembered being left in charge of the brothel when the owner would personally make the rounds of the offices of the National Guard, the Treasury Police, and the National Police. The men said to have taken the locas away wore no uniforms, so there was no way to be sure which force had taken them. We didnt even hear of any of [the locas] being held prisoner, Zulema told us. Of all the ones they carried off, not even cadavers were found. El Salvador is filled with stories like these, people turned into ghosts because unanswered questions are all that remains of them. A monument to the dead and disappeared that was unveiled in San Salvador in 2003 now bears the names of around 30,000 dead or disappeared who have been documented. Another 45,000 are estimated to be missing from that wall, a number that includes the ones who disappeared beneath the Savior of the World. View this image  Patricia Leiva J. Lester Feder / BuzzFeed News Unexplained death became even more common for the trans women of San Salvador after the war. They were victims of the gangs that took over San Salvadors streets, or targeted in drive-by shootings, or killed by HIV. By the turn of the century, the Praviana which the sex workers say was home to dozens of trans women around the time of the wars end had essentially ceased to exist. All thats left is what remains of the Bluegill, with Patricia Leiva living in its carcass. Her home is a small room with a beat-up pallet on a concrete floor for which she pays $3 per day. She survives primarily by selling a few Coca-Colas and packs of gum from her door. She also still turns the occasional trick, though she can only walk a block or so on a good day. She lives about a mile from the Monument to Memory and Truth, and her rusty shack is the closest thing to a memorial for the friends who passed through it. If it is too late to find out who killed the ones who disappeared beneath the Savior of the World, they at least want their memories to be believed. Leiva showed us her ID card when we asked if it was safe to publish her name for this story. Use my name! she demanded. This is serious what weve talked about. And weve told the truth.

aS"The new policy also prohibits restaurants from requiring men to wear ties in order to be served. View this image  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito. Eduardo Munoz / Reuters Employers, landlords, and cops in New York City are now legally required to use peoples pronouns of choice when addressing them and restaurants are no longer allowed to deny service to men just because they refused to wear a tie. These and other new policies are included in document issued on Monday by the New York Commission on Human Rights. The document is meant to explain the specific ways in which the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio intends to enforce a a 2002 local law designed to protect the rights of transgender people. The new guidance states the citys official position on a number of issues. It explicitly establishes that it is illegal to deny people access to bathrooms and shelters that correspond with their gender identity, regardless of the sex they were assigned at birth. Heres the relevant passage: The [New York Civil Rights Law] requires that individuals be permitted to use single-sex facilities, such as bathrooms or locker rooms, and participate in single-sex programs, consistent with their gender, regardless of their sex assigned at birth, anatomy, medical history, appearance, or the sex indicated on their identification. The law does not require entities to make existing bathrooms all-gender or construct additional restrooms. Covered entities [such as landlords, city agencies, and employees] that have single-occupancy restrooms should make clear that they can be used by people of all genders Some people, including, for example, customers, other program participants, tenants, or employees, may object to sharing a facility or participating in a program with a transgender or gender non-conforming person. Such objections are not a lawful reason to deny access to that transgender or gender non-conforming individual. The document also states that employers, landlords, and city agencies including the NYPD are required to refer to people using the pronoun and name of their choice, even if the persons official identification states a different name. The guidance explicitly allows for the use of gender-neutral pronouns, such as ze and hir, in official city business. Among other provisions, the guidance states that requiring different dress codes or uniforms for people of different gender expressions is illegal in New York. This means, for example, that restaurants are no longer allowed to require men to wear ties in order to be served. Heres the passage explaining the citys reasoning: The variability of expressions associated with gender and gender norms contrast vastly across culture, age, community, personality, style, and sense of self. Placing the burden on individuals to justify their gender identity or expression and demonstrate why a particular distinction makes them uncomfortable or does not conform to their gender expression would serve to reinforce the traditional notion of gender that our law has disavowed. Differing standards based on gender will always be rooted in gender norms and stereotypes, even when they may be perceived by some as innocuous. When an individual is treated differently because of their gender and required to conform to a specific standard assigned to their gender, that is gender discrimination regardless of intent, and that is not permissible under the NYCHRL. Violations of the new policies could result in civil penalties of up to $250,000, according to the guidance document. 2.

aS"The fatality happened almost exactly five years after President Obama officially repealed the Dont Ask, Dont Tell policy. facebook.com One of the six American service members who was killed on Monday by a suicide bombing in Afghanistan is believed to have been the first openly gay service member to die in combat since the repeal of Dont Ask, Dont Tell. U.S. Air Force Maj. Adrianna M. Vorderbruggen, a 36-year-old from Minnesota, was among the victims of the attack, which took place at Bagram Air Base in eastern Afghanistan. According to ABC 7 News, Vorderbruggen was from the Bay Area in California and was married to Heather Lamb. The couple had a 4-year-old son. Vorderbruggen was killed just one day after the five-year anniversary of President Obama officially repealing the Dont Ask, Dont Tell policy, which precluded openly gay and lesbian service members from serving in the military. While Vorderbruggen was not the first out troop ever to be killed, she appears to have been the first to die since the repeal of Dont Ask, Dont Tell. Sue Fulton, president of an organization called Service Members, Partners, Allies for Respect and Tolerance for All (SPARTA), reflected on the significance of the repeal in a statement sent to BuzzFeed News. Many LGBT Americans have given their lives in military service to the nation. Thanks to the repeal of Dont Ask, Dont Tell, Major Vorderbruggens wife will be honored rather than hiding in the shadows. This tragedy is a sobering reminder of why its important that our service members and their families be recognized for who they really are; gay, straight, transgender, all deserve honor for their sacrifice. The Military Partners and Family Coalition posted a note to Facebook recalling memories of Maj. Vorderbruggen and her family. View this embed  In the post, she is remembered as one of the most friendly and laid-back people you could ever hope to meet and was an accomplished airman, a great athlete, and most of all, a wonderful mom. According to ABC 7, Lamb received her wifes flag-draped casket at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. Before the Dont Ask, Dont Tell repeal, she would not have been able to do that.

At the heart of the dispute is Davis, who was sued in federal court for refusing to issue marriage licenses after the Supreme Courts ruling for marriage equality. Davis contended that issuing licenses to same-sex couples violated her religious freedom, because Kentucky state law mandates that the name of elected county clerks appear on the licenses which Davis argued was a form of endorsement of those marriages. Bevin issued an executive order Tuesday that directs the Kentucky Department for Libraries and Archives to issue a revised marriage license to Kentucky county clerks. According to press release from his office, The name of the County Clerk is no longer required to appear on the form. Gov. Bevin supplied a new marriage license form with his order that includes a field for the name and title of the official issuing the licenses. The previous form specifically called for the name of the county clerk under whose authority the license was issued. Jessica Ditto, a spokesperson for the governor, told BuzzFeed News, Its a simple solution that ensures everyones religious beliefs are honored. It removes any form of conflict that may be found by issuing those marriage licenses. Asked where the governor derives authority to change the licensing form requirements without action from the legislature, Ditto said that legislative action is simply not required. But Bill Sharp, legal director of the ACLU of Kentucky, which is representing the plaintiffs in the suit against Davis, disagreed. In a statement, Sharp said, The requirement that the county clerks name appear on marriage licenses is prescribed by Kentucky law and is not subject to unilateral change by the governor conceded by the previous administration in court filings. Today, however, a new administration claims to have that authority. Governor Bevins executive action has added to the cloud of uncertainty that hangs over marriage licensing in Kentucky, he added. Although Davis was briefly jailed this summer for violating a court order to issue the licenses, one of her deputy clerks has since been providing licenses to same sex couples; however, the licenses have lacked Daviss name, raising questions about their validity. Mat Staver, chairman of Liberty Counsel, the Christian advocacy law firm representing Davis in court, said in a statement that the executive order was a wonderful Christmas gift for Kim Davis. What former Gov. [Steve] Beshear could have done but refused to do, Gov. Bevin did with this executive order, Staver said. We will notify the courts of the executive order and this order proves our point that a reasonable accommodation should have been done to avoid Kim having to spend time in jail. Asked if Gov. Bevin would take further steps concerning marriage licenses or if he would attempt to obstruct the Supreme Court rulings implementation in the state, Ditto told BuzzFeed News, He does not believe the government should be involved in the marriage business whatsoever. Ditto declined to elaborate. Amid the uproar over Davis and Rowan County, two other county clerks in Kentucky the clerks in Casey and Whitley Counties have also refused to issue marriage licenses. However, no plaintiffs have come forward to challenge those county clerks in court. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The Human Rights Campaign said its next big focus after marriage equality was passing LGBT nondiscrimination laws. But theyre losing ground to an attack spreading fear about who would be allowed in bathrooms. View this image  BuzzFeed News In late October, Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin explained why his group was spending an unprecedented $600,000 to uphold an ordinance in Houston that banned discrimination. It was critical, he said, for the largest LGBT organization in the country to represent the interests of its 1.5 million members and supporters. These are grassroots folks who give to us so that we can fight these battles, wherever they are, Griffin told BuzzFeed News at the campaign headquarters, where hed just flown in from Washington, D.C. After marriage equality was won at the Supreme Court, HRC placed a priority on passing a nondiscrimination law in Congress. To build momentum, they endeavored to pass nondiscrimination legislation in cities and states along the way. Griffin said that when building momentum across the country, every victory you have is a building block. So defending Houstons law was essential. This is a big one, its an important one, its an expensive one, he said. But its a battle we have got to win. Six days later, however, voters repealed the law by a 22-percentage point chasm despite the fact that Griffin and his allies were six and nine points ahead in two early polls. Houston Unites, the name of the central campaign, had raised about $4 million in total, outspending their opponents three to one. What happened? View this image  Paul Abell / AP Images for Human Rights Campaign Their defeat can be attributed primarily to one ubiquitous, bumper-sticker-ready slogan: No men in womens bathrooms. Anti-LGBT activists ran that message with visceral TV and radio commercials that claimed Houstons nondiscrimination law would lead to men sexually assaulting young girls in public restrooms. This attack has been raised by conservative opponents virtually everywhere laws like this have been debated in recent years. The argument is based on an underlying premise that transgender women are actually dangerous men a claim that has no factual foothold. Its never been an issue in the 200 cities and 17 states with laws like these on the books. But its kryptonite to LGBT nondiscrimination laws. One day after the Houston defeat, on Nov. 5, Griffin addressed his massive lists of members and supporters with an email titled, A wake up call. While I know that the loss in Houston is heartbreaking and not something anyone thought would happen, this fight isnt over, he wrote. We will refuse to let something like this happen in your hometown. There was also this fundraising pitch: We have emptied the war chest for the fight in Houston and we need to replenish now for the battles ahead. About a month later, the next battle is here and that same virulent bathroom message, inevitably, is back. But its not clear that HRC got the wake-up call. The organization the top organization trying to pass and uphold LGBT nondiscrimination policies is unwilling to say how it plans to address the bathroom attack, or even how its strategy will change in the wake of the Houston vote and other cities. Within the past year, voters in Springfield, Missouri, and Fayetteville, Arkansas, also repealed nondiscrimination laws after critics warned about men in womens restrooms, along with concerns about infringements of religious freedoms. A bill that had been moving through the city council in Cleveland, Ohio, stalled in late 2014 after the bathroom attack was raised. In Charlotte, North Carolina, the city council rejected the same sort of bill in March after critics deployed the bathroom attack. The same message is already resonating on other 2016 battlefields. Activists filed a petition in Anchorage, Alaska, the day before Thanksgiving to repeal the citys LGBT nondiscrimination law, which was passed by the city council in September. Whats the primary motivation to overturn the law? We do not believe that a man should be using the same bathroom as our little girls, Bernadette Wilson, who filed the application for a referendum, told BuzzFeed News in early December. View this image  Pat Sullivan / AP Likewise in Indiana, an effort is already underway to block an LGBT nondiscrimination bill by focusing on the bathroom issue. Eric Miller, executive director of the group Advance America, proclaims in a new video, The women and children of Indiana are in great danger. Millers warns that the Indiana legislature, which convenes Jan. 5, will be considering dangerous legislation that could give a man including a sexual predator, a rapist, or child molester the right to be in a womens restroom and womens locker room with your wife, your sister, your mom, your daughter, and your granddaughter. LGBT-rights activists are also trying to pass a nondiscrimination law in Jacksonville, Florida where opponents adopted a rallying cry last month of No men in womens bathrooms and they are remounting an effort in Charlotte. Its simmering in Anchorage, where proponents of the repeal effort are currently sparring with the city over petition language. In short, this is an ongoing problem for LGBT nondiscrimination efforts perhaps the greatest obstacle to achieving their post-marriage agenda. BuzzFeed News asked HRC spokesperson Olivia Dalton, a couple times in early November and again early December, how the nations leading LGBT advocacy group will deal with the bathroom attack when this comes up again in Anchorage and other locales expected to take up the same sort of law in early 2016. HRC will be mobilizing our millions of members, supporters, and pro-equality voters in places where LGBT people are under attack, and we are looking at where our other resources will have the greatest impact, said Dalton, avoiding a direct answer. HRC did those things Dalton mentioned in Houston more than it ever had done before, including shipping 34 staffers to work full time on the campaign and it failed. They keep on making the same mistakes over and over, said Barbra Casbar Siperstein, a member of the DNCs executive committee and political director of Gender Rights Advocacy Association of New Jersey, who spoke to BuzzFeed News in her own capacity and not on behalf of the organizations. I really dont see that they have a plan have they learned from the Houston experience? Moreover, she continued, If LGBT equality laws are being repealed locally, its going to make it impossible to do anything nationally. Presidential candidates have also picked up the issue, particularly in response to the Obama administration interpreting civil rights laws to say transgender students can use single-sex school facilities corresponding with their gender identity. On Nov. 19, Sen. Ted Cruz argued the federal government is going after school districts, trying to force them to let boys shower with little girls. Asked yet again this month how HRC would address the bathroom issue, HRC did not answer. They absolutely have a responsibility to figure this out, Justine Turnage, vice president of Arkansass Transgender Equality Network, said in a phone call with BuzzFeed News. And the thing is, we are telling them how to approach this. If they are going to push these ordinances, and get us hopeful for new protections, then they need to be able to win it and make it stick. Thats going to require heavier emphasis on transgender issues. Turnage worked on the campaign to uphold Fayettevilles LGBT nondiscrimination ordinance, a campaign that failed in 2014 despite HRCs heavy involvement. Local activists then remounted a campaign to pass and uphold the law in 2015 this time successfully without HRCs prominent hand, she said. Their strategy: putting transgender people and locals out front on the campaign. BuzzFeed News asked the same question of Freedom For All Americans, another key national player in the Houston campaign, but got no reply. That group, it bears mentioning, includes many former employees of Freedom to Marry, which is shuttering operations after winning at the Supreme Court. The new group has explicitly aimed to use successful Freedom to Marry strategies in advancing LGBT nondiscrimination work. But the larger problem, it appears, is that the modern LGBT rights movement was built around opposing anti-gay efforts at the ballot and within government and eventually winning on gay issues, particularly marriage equality. During that time, though, the big national groups invested comparatively little infrastructure or expertise into nurturing transgender issues. Moreover, they conducted less organization-building and education within conservative states where marriage equality prevailed due to court rulings more than grassroots activism even though those states lacked anti-discrimination laws. Now, the remaining battles for LGBT rights are largely focused on those issues and in those conservative states. Its particularly unsurprising the bathroom message has returned to Anchorage, where an LGBT nondiscrimination initiative was beaten back just in 2012. This is one of the commercials, which says the law would have allowed a man who identifies as a woman to terrify women in locker rooms. youtube.com Although the attacks, as described by critics, are a myth, discrimination against transgender people is verifiably rampant. Study after study shows trans people are refused jobs and housing, physically attacked, and murdered in highly disproportionate rates. According to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, homicides of trans women in the United States doubled in the past year. So the bathroom smear against this population is not just a means to legalize anti-transgender discrimination, its a catalyst to promote it. The tragedy here is trans folks are the ones who are often harassed and victimized when they visit public bathrooms, because folks across the country are perpetuating this myth, Andrea Zekis, policy director of Basic Rights Oregon, told BuzzFeed News. Transgender people visit bathrooms for the same reasons as everyone else to use it. And when we do, we want privacy, dignity, and respect just like everyone else. Grassroots activists have suggested several responses for campaigns. The most obvious is pointing out there have been no incidents of these LGBT nondiscrimination laws being used for nefarious purposes in restrooms in the cities and states where they are currently on the books. Another defense: In TV ads, campaigns could feature transgender women who familiarize themselves to voters, show theyre not men, and explain that they use the bathroom to pee, not to prey. Like in every movement, Zekis said, stories are our most powerful tool. Thats how we brought love back to marriage and we can do the same for giving dignity and respect to transgender people in this country. Not addressing this myth feeds this culture of violence and misunderstanding about transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals. Perhaps most pointedly, scruffy, muscular transgender men have been posting selfies from inside womens bathrooms ostensibly where some conservative activists and politicians want transgender men to pee to show that requiring people to use the restrooms associated with their birth sex actually creates the very problem of men in womens bathrooms conservatives claim to oppose. (Republicans in Florida and other states have introduced bills in the last year requiring people to use the restroom associated with their birth sex.) #occupotty #wejustneedtopee #translivesmatter #guyslikeus #thankyouforthesupport But some political experts have suggested LGBT advocates avoid the bathroom debate entirely. Robert Stein, a political science professor at Rice University, oversaw a poll by his college and the University of Houston that gauged persuasiveness of pro and con arguments. The strongest argument for repealing the law was bathrooms, swinging nearly 7% of voters to oppose the measure, he told BuzzFeed News a few days before the elections. But there was an even stronger counter message to uphold the law focusing on the economic risks of repealing it and Stein said proponents should focus on that. But instead Houston Unites spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on ads that argued the nondiscrimination law made the city more equitable for everyone, particularly focusing on veterans. Indeed, the law banned discrimination on a wide range of characteristics, from race and gender identity to sexual orientation and military status. In response to critics, one ad showed a former cop saying predatory behavior in bathrooms was unfounded and illegal under the law. But Richard Carlbom, the campaign manager of Houston Unites, told BuzzFeed News he did not know how much they actually ran that ad on TV. It was important to assuage concerns about the bathroom message, he said, and then focus on the benefits of the law. I think we have done a good job of providing people a space to lower their anxiety and then find a path to get to a yes vote, he said four days before the election. View this image  Michael Stravato / AP Images for Human Rights Campaign But consider the strategy for marriage equality, which ultimately won popular support because people saw images of loving same-sex couples and their families. Maybe that strategy of aggressively putting forward people in the heart of the debate in this case, transgender women will persuade voters in some places, and maybe not work in others. For their part, the American Civil Liberties Union a major player in LGBT politics nationally did respond to BuzzFeed News request to comment about the bathroom issue. The groups state affiliate had raised money for the Houston campaign and donated its office to become the campaign headquarters. Crystal Cooper, a spokesperson for the ACLU, said the group is committed to upholding the law in Anchorage and to countering deceitful anti-trans rhetoric used to try to repeal it. We will do so by educating voters and helping them understand who transgender people are (i.e., NOT men dressing up as women), that they are not sexual predators, that they need to be able to use the restroom safely just like everyone else, and that the nondiscrimination ordinance does not give anyone a defense for entering a restroom to harm or harass others, Cooper wrote in an email. She continued: We learned from Houston that we have a long way to go in combatting prejudice against transgender people, and we know we need to focus much more on breaking down those stereotypes, in our work to both pass and defend sexual orientation and gender identity protections. But for now, there is simply no cohesive strategy from HRC despite fundraising pitches that are based on a promise to prevail in the nondiscrimination fights to deal with the bathroom issue. Funding for LGBT groups has grown steadily since the recession in 2008, according to a Dec. 3 report by the Movement Advancement Project, which found those groups collectively only took a decline of less than 1% in 2015. Despite that decline, the report found, Individual donor revenue grew 11% from 2013 to 2014. HRC reported $37 million in revenue in 2014, of which $28.8 million came from donations, fundraisers, grants, and other contributions. Tax records show those levels have remained essentially steady from the two years before. After winning marriage in June, HRC announced their new priority was banning discrimination federally. Heres the next major fight for the LGBT community, said the subject line from one of the email blasts, while a July press release declared, Historic Marriage Equality Ruling Generates Momentum for New Non-Discrimination Law. Their aim: Passing the Equality Act, which was introduced in Congress later that month. But as local versions of the same sort of law are repealed, while the bathroom chant gets louder, the Equality Act has has foundered in Congress without a single Republican co-sponsor let alone a committee hearing. As HRCs Dalton said by email, These battles all over the country also underscore why we have to do everything in our power to mobilize the pro-equality vote in 2016. We want to see full federal equality for LGBT Americans, and the Equality Act wont be signed into law without an ally in the White House. But its equally hard to see how the Equality Act could get traction in Congress while similar laws are being repealed by voters at the local level particularly Democratic districts represented by members of Congress who would need to push the bill. Its also difficult to see how these local laws can be passed and upheld when the LGBT movement lacks a defense against the bathroom attack. As Griffin himself point out, supporters give so that HRC can fight those very fights and presumably, figure out how to win them. If our advocates and the people pushing for full LGBT rights dont get their act together, and dont have trans people out there destroying the myth, its going to keep on happening, said Siperstein, the New Jersey activist. But if you know its going to be brought up, you need to be proactive, she continued. You have a trans face. You have a poster child. When you are attacked, you cant run away and hide. Sometimes you have to attack first, you have to be flexible, you have to have a plan A, a plan B, and a plan C. You have to adjust. This is a war. Griffin acknowledged before the Houston election that our opponents arent going away. They are going to fight us tooth and nail in every single one of these battles, he said. We are fighting them in small towns and in big cities. View this image  BuzzFeed News  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

Its important for you that other people feel comfortable and loved, but sometimes you forget about yourself. Try not to forget that you can find contentment not just in being there for others but showing up to take care of your own needs. This may also be a relief to people around you who can sometimes feel stifled by your attention. You give the impression of being in charge and in control, but that also means you tend to keep your feelings bottled up, and that can bite you in the ass in times of crisis. Be confident in yourself, but also allow for the inevitable moments when you feel vulnerable, and encounter negative circumstances beyond your control. You are the amazing and always supportive best friend who is wise and have tons of experience. Just keep on being you, but remember that you dont always have to play the supporting role. Youre just as much of a star as anyone. You have a lot of sass and attitude but thats just armor for your fundamentally sweet and sensitive nature. Youre like one of those cats that screeches when someone goes near you but becomes a total sweetheart once shes petted. Purrrrrr. Youre the sweetest, kindest person in the world, so theres no reason for you to feel inadequate. Its hard for you when things dont go your way, and you feel as though thats been happening a lot. But dont worry happiness is just around the corner. Rather than going for what you want, you tend to spend a lot of time wishing for things you wish you cant have. Daydreaming is all well and good, but when theres something you really want, theres really no harm in going for it, because even if you fail at least you tried. You are sweet and lovely and people are drawn by the innocence of your perspective. There are times, though, when you end up doing stuff you dont really want to do just to please others, because theres a part of you that feels like youll be rejected if you werent so nice. Make sure you dont lose too much of yourself, and dont be afraid to show a more complicated side of you to people you love. Youre the gorgeous party girl with the loyal heart. You always live in the moment, which is why so many people are drawn to your effortless charisma. Its important for you not to get too carried away though, and also think about what lies ahead, so you dont end up getting trapped by your own fearlessness. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"I was totally messier than the Barefoot Contessa, but learned a bit about myself and my new marriage. View this image  View on Instagram Ive been OBSESSED with Ina Garten and her iconic show Barefoot Contessa pretty much since it debuted on Food Network. Food Network Food Network Literally dozens of episodes are devoted to Ina cooking Jeffrey his favorite meals and randomly throwing parties/doing romantic things for Jeffrey just because she likes any excuse to celebrate her husband. A lengthy, healthy marriage is something I aspire to have. View this image   In an effort to learn to become a better (new) spouse, Id attempt to live like Ina Garten for a full week.  The primary focus will be cooking meals that Id consider Davids favorites, and trying to make sure that no one else is cooking for him during the week.  Id also plan daily surprises and activities all focused on pleasing David. In essence, Id spend the week completely devoted to my husbands needs despite the impact on my own sanity and stress levels. View this image  Trying to do my best Ina I even left out a handwritten note for David. I was feeling confident, like I was hella on my shit! Id been meticulously planning every meal and activity for the week, but didnt so much as google the weather when I decided to surprise David with an outdoor picnic at the beach. View this image  The first lesson I learned was that living like Ina Garten is expensive. Those good ingredients she insists on using certainly arent cheap. Food Network Mathew Jedeikin for BuzzFeed I know, it was an expensive-ass lunch, but my hope was that it wouldve been the best picnic David ever had. Because thats the compliment Jeffrey gave Ina when she served him something similar. Yeah, no. David was appreciative of the meal, but after hearing all of the mega-compliments Jeffrey regularly gives Ina, I was totally expecting more. View this image  We attempted to go for a romantic stroll on the beach, but it was way too cold and wet. Thankfully, David enjoyed the leisurely drive to and back from Stinson Beach. Honestly though, I would have rather spent the afternoon watching Netflix indoors. David is though, so I was heavy-handed with the Roquefort. View this image  That counts for something, right? View this image  But while rewatching the episode I started feeling really irritated. Wondering things like, how the fuck was I going to find vanilla beaninfused sugar? Long story short, I didnt. And I honestly didnt even know that long-stem strawberries were a thing, but after a few Google searches I realized it wasnt going to happen. View this image  Ina week had quickly became a source of extra stress for us both. The goal was to be completely devoted to David and his needs, not to send him out on multiple errands so that I could make an Instagramworthy dinner. View this image  Hell yeah! View this image  View this image  I used one of Inas cake recipes and would later decorate it in the same style as the cake Ina made for one of her and Jeffreys anniversaries. It seemed fitting, as it was our own two-week wedding anniversary. First, I dont know how the fuck Ina manages to ice a cake wearing a fancy button-down shirt, because as soon as I turned on the mixer there was powdered sugar everywhere. Id been trying to wear button downs every evening during Ina week, but on cake night it was impossible. Second, trying to keep anything in the kitchen a surprise from David is really inconvenient. View this image  I couldnt help but imagine how nice itd be if David were off in another wing of our massive estate and I could just focus on the task at hand without having to break for blindfolded bathroom visits. Food Network Mathew Jedeikin for BuzzFeed View this image  Whats the point of having a wedding cake if you cant shove some of it into your husbands face? View this image  My response: Toast. I was sassy, because I didnt like how he was coming to expect daily surprises. But in reality, there was another surprise awaiting David. I had decided that not only would we do a movie night, but that wed watch one of Davids favorites: Before Sunrise. I honestly cant stand the film, but David has rewatched countless Disney movies with me over the years, so why not? View this image  Ina raves about truffle butter, and uses it in multiple dishes, including her truffled popcorn that Id be serving for movie night. But I couldnt help and pause to think about the fact that I was about to spend $10 on fancy butter to melt and pour over popcorn, and another $9 on vanilla beans for ice cream. Food Network Mathew Jedeikin for BuzzFeed The dressed pears were slippery, the endive leaves were small, and the blue cheese was sticky and smelly. Replating endives for myself was two minutes I simply didnt have. View this image  One of my favorite episodes of Barefoot Contessa is the one where Ina makes Jeffrey an easy-to-reheat dinner since shes planning to be out for the evening. She also reminds us that she doesnt like other people cooking for Jeffrey, which was something I was striving for this week. I enjoy knowing that David relies on me for food, just like I rely on him for so many other things. The fact that we trust and rely on each other makes me feel like our partnership is strong. View this image  Food Network Mathew Jedeikin for BuzzFeed But he didnt need to leave that early after all. Come to find out the office he was visiting didnt open until 10. Whomp, whomp. I was legit PISSED. Id spent most of the week catering to David, and was irritated AF that he didnt clear the sink before going to bed. View this image  It wasnt really fair of me to become so hostile. Especially when the point of this challenge was to be devoted to Davids needs. Not to create extra chores for him. Plus, the dirty dishes were a result of me being up so late the night before cooking that homemade chili. View on Instagram View this image  I didnt feel like I was being the best newlywed. I was making David a lot of his favorite meals, but the increased tension between us this week was undeniable. View this image  There simply arent enough hours in the day. Inas job is being the Barefoot Contessa. Sadly, mine isnt. So I took time off in order to spend the day really devoted to David. View this image  Serving a dish that David and I actually had in Paris felt so totally Ina that I was practically giddy when I came up with the menu. It was starting to feel like I was just setting David up to fail. Food isnt a hobby for him like it is for me, so how could I reasonably expect him to get a reference as subtle as blue cheese on eggs? Food Network Mathew Jedeikin for BuzzFeed This time sandwiches and salads in take-out boxes that immediately became soggy, despite my best efforts to line them with saran wrap. I was eager to get home and get started on dinner, though, knowing that it would require hours of work. View this image  While David was lighting the Hanukkah candles, I couldnt help but feel verklempt. I definitely do hope that well be together for as long as Ina and Jeffrey, but was starting to feel like their version of a happy marriage wasnt really going to work for us in the long run. Between breakfast, lunch, and the roasted chicken, itd been a marathon of cooking and baking. View this image  I wanted to take a few photos and asked David to wait on actually eating the brownies so I could plate them with the vanilla ice cream. I figured that since I spent hours working on our meal, the least he could do was wait a few more minutes? But honestly, I was just tired and cranky. It definitely wasnt worth having an argument over ice cream. How can the rest of us possibly expect to replicate that caricature of a happy marriage in our own lives? View this image  During the first season of Barefoot Contessa, Ina devoted an episode to a feel good day for herself. Its full of Ina ridiculousness like her power-walking in a black button-down shirt then laughing at slut lip balm while out shopping. But the focus of the episode is Ina dedicating the day to herself, and thats just what I did. Food Network Mathew Jedeikin for BuzzFeed It felt a little weird making just breakfast for myself, though. Mathew Jedeikin for BuzzFeed Mathew Jedeikin for BuzzFeed And you know what? I made plates for David, too! Because it would have been dumb to cut up a cauliflower just to make one steak. And it would have been weird to heat up an oven and wait 90 minutes for just one roasted pear. Focusing in on just Davids favorites this week definitely created an aura of resentment, and I didnt like the pressure of having to cook dinner every single night after work. But that being said, Ill probably always love making food for the people in my life. So what if Im not showered with compliments? To be honest, I find it more satisfying seeing someone clear their plate, and/or go back for seconds, than to receive an inauthentic compliment. View this image   Ina and Jeffrey are obviously rich. The good ingredients she recommends are expensive, and kinda wasteful, IMO.  Every relationship is different. What works for Ina and Jeffrey wont necessarily lead to a happy, long-lasting relationship for everyone. Trying to live like Ina was a lot of fucking work. David and I ate well, but I dont really feel like I became a better spouse.  In my own personal life, Ill totally continue to be the partner who takes care of the food in our household, but recognize that pleasing my husband doesnt have to come at the expense of my own sanity. Why focus on cooking only his favorites, when I can make our favorites? View this image  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .

aS"Critics say the new policy still amounts to a de facto ban that is stigmatizing and without scientific merit. View this image  AP / Toby Talbot The Food and Drug Administration published a revised policy Monday that eases the United States outright ban on blood donations from men who have had sex with men a policy instituted in the 1983 amidst the AIDS epidemic. The new policy states that men who have been sexually active with another man may give blood but only if they have abstained from sexual contact with another man for 12 months or more. That condition, in effect, maintains the ban for gay men who are even somewhat sexually active. The FDA has posted the policy, known as guidance, here. Peter Marks, deputy director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the FDA, said on a conference call with reporters Monday that there is sound scientific evidence based on a similar policy in Australia that the new guidelines will not increase HIV transmissions in the blood supply. However, coming after a one-year process involving public comment, the new guidelines still leave critics saying that the FDA is needlessly stigmatizing gay men and the guidance lacks scientific merit. The revised policy is still discriminatory, said a statement from the National Gay Blood Drive, which advocated along with the American Civil Liberties Union, Gay Mens Health Crisis, and others for a policy that approved or rejected donors based on their individual risk factors not their sexual orientation. While many gay and bisexual men will be eligible to donate their blood and help save lives under this 12 month deferral, countless more will continue to be banned solely on the basis of their sexual orientation and without medical or scientific reasoning, the statement said. FDA officials had also examined eliminating the ban altogether, using a deferral period shorter than 12 months, and assessing donors based on their personal risk factors. But Marks said HIV was too prevalent in the U.S. to eliminate the ban altogether, and not enough data existed from epidemiologically similar countries to support a shorter deferral timeframe or a risk-based assessment. Martin OMalley, former governor or Maryland, appeared to be the only presidential candidate commenting on the new guidelines, condemning them as still discriminatory. .@US_FDA should lift blood ban on gay and bisexual men. A 1 year ban is still discriminatory and doesn't look at actual risk factors. #LGBT Rep. Jared Polis, Democrat of Colorado and chair of the House LGBT Equality Caucus Co-Chair, blasted the policy. It is ridiculous and counter to the public health that a married gay man in a monogamous relationship cant give blood, but a promiscuous straight man who has had hundreds of opposite sex partners in the last year can, Polis said in a statement. The FDAs own BloodDROPS survey has found that the prevalence of HIV in male blood donors who reported that they had sexual relations with men is just 0.25%, which is lower than the overall prevalence in the United States of 0.38%, Polis added. There is no scientific reason to impose a celibacy requirement on gay men before they can donate blood. The rule also addresses transgender donors. It says the FDA recommends that male or female gender be taken to be self-identified and self-reported. But on its own, that change offers little clarity to a policy that some blood banks have interpreted as a ban on all transgender donors. One national blood donation company facing two discrimination lawsuits from transgender women who were allegedly turned away has argued in court records that previous FDA policy banned all transgender women. It is unclear that donors self-reporting gender, as specified by the new guidance, clarifies that issue. Asked about the ambiguity, Marks said, There is no ban on transgender donation through this guidance. However, Marks did not answer a question from BuzzFeed News about how the guidance makes it clear that transgender people are not in fact banned. Whitman-Walker Health, a health center that serves LGBT people and people living with HIV, said in a statement it was disheartened that the FDA has failed to give clear guidance to prevent discrimination against transgender individuals, which occurs too often at blood donation centers. The FDA must do better than this slow chipping away at antiquated bans. The policy was proposed as a draft in May, with similar language to the final guidance released Monday. Responding to that draft, 82 members of Congress sent a letter to the FDA in July that said they were grateful the FDA was relaxing the ban but the one-year-deferral policy and language about transgender donors remained problematic. The drafts proposed policy change would, in practice, leave the lifetime ban in place for the vast majority of [men who have sex with men], even those who are healthy Both deferral policies are discriminatory and not based on science, and both approaches are unacceptable, the Congressional Democrats members wrote in July. The members of Congress also wrote they are deeply concerned that medical directors would be given discretion to turn away transgender donors. Transgender individuals often face discrimination, unfair stigma, and misunderstanding, including by some medical professionals, the lawmakers said in the July letter. Leaving discretion to staff at blood banks increases the chance that a transgender individual will be turned away, and set the stage for discrimination. The guidance is non-binding. However, blood donation centers tend to follow the guidance as policy, typically interpreting it conservatively. Donation centers that move blood products across state lines will need their new procedures approved by the FDA, Marks said, but those operating entirely in-state can implement the new guidelines immediately. Sen Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin, has been among the most dogged members of Congress trying to reform the FDAs blood policy. In a statement Monday, she called the guidelines just the first step toward ending an outdated policy that is medically and scientifically unwarranted. This revision doesnt go far enough and I expect the FDA to maintain its commitment to work with stakeholders to develop better blood donor policies based on science. The FDAs Marks said the agency would revisit the policy as more data becomes available to consider risk-based assessments and a shorter deferral period. France announced in November that it would loosen its ban on blood donations from gay men starting in spring 2016. Men who have abstained from sex with men for one year will be allowed to donate; men who have had sex with just one man, or have not been sexually active, could donate after four months. Responding to the FDAs final guidance, the Human Rights Campaign called it a step in the right direction that nonetheless fell short. The LGBT advocacy groups government affairs director, David Stacy, said in a statement, It simply cannot be justified in light of current scientific research and updated blood screening technology. This new policy prevents men from donating life-saving blood based solely on their sexual orientation rather than actual risk to the blood supply. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The distinction between gender stereotyping and sexual orientation discrimination is illusory and artificial, Judge Dean Pregerson writes in a lawsuit against Pepperdine University. The ruling is the latest move in a larger, ongoing effort to protect LGBT people from discrimination under existing civil rights laws. View this image  Pepperdine University website Via pepperdine.edu WASHINGTON The federal ban on sex discrimination in education includes a ban on sexual orientation discrimination, a federal judge in California ruled this past week. U.S. District Court Judge Dean Pregersons ruling appears to be the first time a federal judge has made this ruling as it pertains to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the federal ban on sex discrimination in education. Without much fanfare, advocates and federal officials in recent years, with support from some courts, have undertaken a significant effort to expand the reach of existing federal anti-discrimination laws primarily Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX to cover lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people from discrimination. The California case was brought by two women who allege that Pepperdine University discriminated against and harassed them because of their perceived sexual orientation. Discussing the line between discrimination based on gender stereotyping and discrimination based on sexual orientation, Pregerson wrote, the Court concludes that the distinction is illusory and artificial, and that sexual orientation discrimination is not a category distinct from sex or gender discrimination. Haley Videckis and Layana White, two former members of Pepperdines womens basketball team, allege in the lawsuit that they faced discriminatory treatment after the teams [coach] and others on the staff of the womens basketball team came to the conclusion that Plaintiffs were lesbians and were in a lesbian relationship, as Pregerson wrote. The alleged actions of Adi Conlogue, an athletic academic coordinator for the team, are highlighted in the complaint, as detailed by Pregerson in his ruling. View this image  Via assets.documentcloud.org The decision allows Videckis and Whites lawsuit to proceed. Explaining his reasoning, Pregerson wrote that claims of discrimination based on sexual orientation are covered by Title VII and IX not as a category of independent claims separate from sex and gender stereotype, but instead because claims of sexual orientation discrimination are gender stereotype or sex discrimination claims. View this image  Via assets.documentcloud.org A series of agency rulings, administration moves, and court fights in recent years have sought to expand the definition of sex in those laws to include gender identity, aimed at anti-transgender discrimination. More recently, the moves have also sought to expand that definition of sex to include sexual orientation, aimed at anti-LGB discrimination. Over the course of the past four years, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has led on these issues. In several rulings, beginning in early 2012, the agency has established its view that the sex discrimination ban in Title VII covers anti-transgender discrimination and other discrimination based on gender identity. Once that was established, at least within the EEOC, the agency ruled in July of this year that the same ban also covers anti-gay discrimination and other discrimination based on sexual orientation. Pregerson cited that decision in the ruling allowing the lawsuit against Pepperdine to proceed. View this image  Via assets.documentcloud.org In addition to the EEOC decisions binding federal agencies, the EEOC, as BuzzFeed News reported early this year, also is working to ensure these rulings are being enforced in all its field offices across the country offices that investigate and attempt to settle discrimination complaints in the private industry. The Justice Department formally supported the EEOCs position as to gender identity at the end of 2014. Since then, it has taken that position in a handful of court cases, through the filing of statements of interest or amicus curiae briefs in cases from Texas to Virginia. The Justice Department has not, however, weighed in yet on the sexual orientation question at issue in the lawsuit against Pepperdine University. Although advances in gay rights might make it seem like the sexual orientation-based argument would have moved before the gender identity-based argument, there were many court rulings explicitly holding that sexual orientation discrimination is not protected by sex discrimination bans, particularly before the Supreme Court struck down sodomy laws as unconstitutional. Now, however, with sodomy laws struck down and equal protection principles invoked in protecting LGB peoples same-sex relationships, agencies and courts have begun rethinking the question first under Title VII and now under Title IX. At the same time, the gender identity-related question is proceeding in a case that could reach the U.S. Supreme Court as soon as this fall. Gavin Grimm, a transgender male student, sued Gloucester County School District in Virginia after the district enacted a policy that bars him from using the male restrooms at the school. The case, now on appeal and with the Obama administration backing Grimm is scheduled to be heard by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals at the end of January. The losing side there could ask the Supreme Court to take up the case a move that certainly would raise the stakes of the issue and, undoubtedly, the coverage of it. Already, Sen. Ted Cruz has criticized the administrations position and Hillary Clintons campaign has announced that she would continue the effort. Grimms case, though, only addresses the gender identity-related portion of the argument. Even were that case to be heard by the Supreme Court, the questions raised in the case against Pepperdine University about whether sexual orientation is covered by existing sex discrimination bans would remain unresolved.

aS"In the past four years, at least 60 schools have applied for waivers to ignore a 1972 law that bans publicly funded schools from discriminating on the basis of sex a sharp spike from the past two decades. View this image  AP / Jacquelyn Martin Led by Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, eight U.S. senators sent a letter to the Department of Education on Friday calling for officials to be more transparent about religious schools that receive permission to ban LGBT faculty and students while still taking federal money. We are concerned these waivers allow for discrimination under the guise of religious freedom, said the letter sent to to Education Secretary Arne Duncan. BuzzFeed News first reported on the full scope of the trend on Thursday. The lawmakers said the Education Department should maintain a public, searchable website that shows the schools that are being granted waivers from a 1972 federal law that bans publicly funded schools from discriminating on the basis of sex in regards to hiring, admissions, and other issues. Sixty religious universities have applied for exemptions from the law under the Obama Administration, BuzzFeed News found. Thats a sharp uptick from the two previous decades. While such exemptions to Title IX of the Education Act used to primarily concern matters concerning abortion, pregnancy, or banning unmarried faculty, they have shifted in recent years to ban or discriminate against LGBT students or faculty while the schools continue to receive federal money. At a very minimum, we believe that parents, students, and taxpayers have a right to know when institutions of higher education as recipients of tax dollars seek and receive exemptions under Title IX as well as the justification of those exemptions, said the letter. It was co-signed by Sens. Tammy Baldwin, Barbara Boxer, Al Franken, Edward Markey, Jeff Merkley, Patty Murray, and Bernie Sanders. The senators added: Already, we have seen the same path used in our legal system to undermine benefits for women, and used to facilitate discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. The uptick in applications, and their shift in focus, is an apparent response to the Obama administrations interpretation of Title IX , which bans federally funded schools from sex-based discrimination. In April 2014, the Education Department issued guidance stating that Title IX also bans anti-transgender discrimination as a form of sex discrimination. The Column reported earlier this month on nearly thee-dozen such waivers over 18 months. BuzzFeed News reported on all 60 applications under the Obama administration plus 187 waivers from previous administrations, mostly filed in the 1970s and 1980s and how waivers to discriminate against LGBT students are spiking in 2015. On Friday, the Human Rights Campaign issued a report on Title IX waivers. Forty-three of applications were filed this year, and 22 have already been approved. The rest are pending, but no request for an exemption has ever been rejected by this or any previous administration. View this embed   Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The exemptions allow religious schools to ban students and discriminate in regard to hiring, housing, financial aid, and other issues on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity while the schools continue to receive federal money. View this image  Getty Images / Saul Loeb Under President Bill Clinton, 10 universities applied. Under President George W. Bush, two schools sent applications. And during the first few years of President Barack Obamas term, there were none. But within the past few years, according to records the U.S. Department of Education provided to BuzzFeed News, 60 religious universities have applied for exemptions from a 1972 federal law that bans publicly funded schools from discriminating on the basis of sex in regards to hiring, admissions, and other issues. Forty-three of those applications were filed this year, and 22 have already been approved. The rest are pending, but no request for an exemption has ever been rejected by this or any previous administration. Not only are the number of requests for waivers and approvals spiking, schools are now seeking a different type of exemption than under previous administrations. A Department of Education official who spoke to BuzzFeed News on the condition the official not be named said waivers in past decades usually concerned matters like only allowing men into seminary schools, abortion, pregnancy, or banning unmarried faculty. Under the Obama administration, however, the official said applicants have overwhelmingly sought to ban or discriminate against LGBT students or faculty while the schools continue to receive federal money. The uptick in applications, and their shift in focus, is an apparent response to the Obama administrations interpretation of Title IX of the Education Act of 1972, which bans federally funded schools from sex-based discrimination. In April 2014, the Education Department issued guidance reinforcing a stance the government had asserted in previous settlements with individual school districts stating that Title IX also bans anti-transgender discrimination as a form of sex discrimination. Since then, the Justice Department filed a brief in federal appeals court to support a transgender student in Virginia who suing his school district for access to the boys restroom. Just this month, the Education Department worked to reach a settlement with an Illinois school district to grant a transgender girl access to the girls locker room. Encouraged by Christian legal advocacy groups, including the Alliance Defending Freedom, schools then took advantage of a largely unused provision of the 1972 law that allows exemptions for an educational institution which is controlled by a religious organization if the law violates the schools religious tenets. [G]iven [the Education Department]s application of this unwarranted understanding of Title IX in other contexts, ADF senior counsel Greg Baylor told BuzzFeed News in a statement, the schools have reasonably concluded that they are quite likely to become the next target of [the departments Office of Civil Rights] if they follow their religious convictions on these matters. These schools have thus exercised their legal right, established by Congress in 1972, to an exemption from applications of Title IX that would violate their shared religious convictions. Among 11 applicants in 2014 was Spring Arbor University President Brent Ellis, who contacted the Education Department two months after the administration announced the guidance on Title IX. It is the Universitys position, based upon its religious beliefs taken from Biblical principles and the Doctrine of the Free Methodist Church, that a person cannot change his or her birth sex, he wrote in a June 2014 application. The University is requesting exemption on religious grounds from Title IX, he continued, to allow the University religious freedom to discriminate on the basis of sex, including gender identity, and sexual orientation, in regard to housing, living arrangements, restrooms, locker rooms, and athletics. Like other schools, Spring Arbor University also noted its opposition to abortion. The school received $23 million during the 20132014 school year in Pell grants and federal student loans combined, according to the Education Departments National Association for Education Statistics. The Education Department was unable to identify exactly how much federal discretionary grants were given to the schools with waivers. However, an official noted that the records for Pell grants and federal student loans represent the major federal funding sources for the schools. In 2015, the applications for waivers appear to become increasingly similar in their language and formula, citing the portions of the law they seek waivers from and excerpts of the religious groups beliefs. The applications seek the right to discriminate largely in admissions and hiring, but also housing, athletics, and financial aid. The letters tend to focus on gender identity and sexual orientation in the latter case, citing their belief that marriage is limited to one man and one woman but the groups also state their opposition to premarital sex, abortion, and pregnancy. The exemptions extend only to the specific issues sought, not blanket permission to be exempted from the requirements of Title IX. The most recent waiver granted was to Hannibal LaGrange University, on Oct. 30. The Southern Baptist school, which received $6 million in federal student loans and Pell grants in the 20132014 school year, said in an August letter said it was a biblically-based Christian environment and referred to a Baptist statement on the family that said God made people male and female as the crowning work of His creation. The gift of gender is thus part of the goodness of Gods creation. As such, the application from university president Anthony W. Allen said, the school could not reconcile its faith and Title IX if it prohibited the university from recruiting, admissions, and financial assistance, under a policy which called for the consideration of an applicant for admissions sexual orientation, gender identity (including but not limited to transgender status), marital status, past and present practices regarding marriage, and sex outside marriage and prohibited the institution from treating that person differently as a result of that consideration. Catherine E. Lhamon, the Department of Educations assistant secretary for civil rights, replied to the Hannibal-LaGranges request and the other similarly worded requests confirming the waivers. In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Lhamon acknowledged the dichotomy of granting waivers while enforcing Title IX at other schools. We in the Department of Education vigorously enforce Title IXs prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sex, including gender identity, in every applicable school, she said. Congress did exempt from Title IXs protection institutions that are controlled by religious organizations, to the extent that Title IX conflicts with their religious tenets. We are committed to protecting every student Congress gave us jurisdiction to protect, to the fullest extent of the law. But issuing the waivers has also led to criticism from those who say the department must be more transparent and the religious loophole should be closed. View this image  Larry French / Getty Images for SiriusXM Ian Thompson, legislative representative for the American Civil Liberties Union, told BuzzFeed News that Congress should pass legislation to narrow the kind of carte blanche discrimination that Title IXs sweeping religious exemption permits. If schools want to engage in sex discrimination, the federal government should not be funding it with taxpayer dollars, he said. ADFs Baylor, however, defended the exemption as a key congressional decision to protect religious freedom. The Title IX exemption reflects the undeniable fact that in a diverse country, Americans will inevitably disagree about foundational issues, including on matters of religious belief and practice, he said in his statement. Reflecting the best traditions of our nation, Congress declared that these differences ought to be respected and accommodated, even as it sets baseline requirements for educational institutions whose students benefit from tuition assistance programs. Given the current law, Thompson at the ACLU said, officials should at least publish all of the waivers the department approves and show what the specific waiver it allows the colleges to do. LGBT students and their families have a right to know the discrimination they can be subjected to by their school based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, he said. A total of 187 exemptions were granted by previous administrations. Many of those were from universities applying in the 1970s. But the Education Department official said that after the Education Act was passed, government took little action to grant them until the Reagan administration in the 1980s, when many were approved in a burst. Those primarily concerned pregnancy, sex, divorce, abortion, and sex outside of marriage. In order to get approved for a waiver, a religious school must be preparing students to be ministers or for a religious vocation; require faculty, students, or staff to be members of their faith; or be controlled and significantly funded by a religious organization.

aS"Greece and Slovenia are the latest European battle grounds over partnership rights. View this image  Protesters march during an 2015 Gay Pride rally in Athens, Greece Yorgos Karahalis / AP Two countries in Europe will hold key tests in coming days on partnership rights for same-sex couples. One is Greece, where the parliament could vote as soon as Dec. 22 as legislation to open a civil partnership status currently restricted to opposite-sex couples to gays and lesbians. If it passes, the legislation would bring Greece into compliance with a 2013 ruling of the European Court of Human Rights, one of several recent rulings recognizing rights for same-sex couples under international law, though the court has stopped short of deciding they are entitled to marry. After years of lobbying, the ruling left-wing Syriza Party proposed legislation allowing for civil partnership earlier this year. Konstantina Kosmidou, who sits on the board of the Greek LGBT organization OLKE and the European branch of the International Lesbian and Gay Association said she expects it to pass by a wide margin when its put to a final vote. Im happy satisfied, she told BuzzFeed News. Its a first achievement for everybody. The law does not grant all the rights of marriage, dealing primarily with issues like insurance and inheritance and excludes matters including parental rights. But, Kosmidou said, its a first step this is what they can do. She said LGBT advocates would return to the European Court of Human Rights after it becomes law to prod the government towards full equality. Citizens in the former Yugoslav republic of Slovenia have already begun early voting on a referendum ending on Sunday that will decide the fate of a marriage equality law enacted by the Parliament in March. The law made Slovenia the only country in its region with marriage equality, enacted a little over a year after voters in neighboring Croatia passed a referendum barring marriage for same-sex couples. The laws opponents gathered more than 80,000 signatures in support of repealing it, twice the number required to put the matter to a vote. The countrys LGBT activists are bracing for a tight vote, but the rules of the election may give them a boost. Not only must a majority of those who cast ballots back repeal of the law, but the repeal vote must total at least 20 percent of the countrys entire electorate. If the election is low turnout, the law could still stand even if a majority vote in favor of repeal. Simon Maljevac of the Slovenian LGBT organization LEGEBITRA is optimistic that a vote to uphold the law could resonate well beyond Slovenias borders. We would be the first country not only in the Eastern part of Europe but also in Central Europe that would have full marriage equality, he told BuzzFeed News. It would play a big part for the whole region. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Fontbonne Academy in Massachusetts rescinded a job offer to a man who was due to run the schools food services after learning he was married to another man. View this image  via Fontbonne Academy website / Via fontbonneacademy.org WASHINGTON A state court in Massachusetts has ruled that a Catholic preparatory school violated the states antidiscrimination law when it rescinded a job offer to a man because he was married to another man. Matthew Barrett had accepted a job as Food Service Director at the Fontbonne Academy, a Catholic girls school. On his employment forms, he listed his husband as his emergency contact a move that led the school to rescind the job offer. On Wednesday, Superior Court Associate Justice Douglas Wilkins ruled that Fontbonne discriminated against Barrett based on sexual orientation and rejected the schools arguments as to why it should be exempted from the state law or otherwise not subject to its employment discrimination ban. Barretts lawyers from Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders praised the judges ruling as the first of its kind in the country. Wilkinss first decision in the case was that Barrett was, in fact, discriminated against: View this image  Despite that, the school argued it was exempted from the law and that the state could not, under the U.S. Constitution, enforce the law because it would violate the schools right of expressive association and free exercise of religion all of which the court ultimately rejected. The statutory exemption for education organizations operated, supervised or controlled by or in connection with a religious organization includes exemption for any action with respect to matters of employment language that the court acknowledges appears to confer upon Fontbonne the exemption it claims in this case. However, the court pointed to later language in the statute limiting the employer exemption only to those schools that limit membership, enrollment, admission, or participation to members of that religion. The school, the court found, does no such thing, so the exemption does not apply. As to the constitutional claim, the school argued that its expressive association rights would be infringed if forced to hire Barrett. The court, however, found that the school failed to meet two of the three standards set by the Supreme Court for such claims in its 2000 decision regarding the Boy Scouts. Although the academy does engage in at least some form of expression, meeting the first standard, the court found that there is minimal risk that Barretts hire would significantly and seriously burden [Fontbonnes] expression. Explaining that, Wilkins wrote: View this image  Additionally, the court found that Massachusetts has a compelling interest in prohibiting discrimination an interest rarely stronger than in the employment context such that any burden on associational rights is outweighed by that interest. Finally, the court found that Fontbonnes free exercise claim based on the ministerial exception also failed. Looking at a 2012 Supreme Court case addressing the exception, the court found that Barrett has no duties as an administrator or teacher of religious matters and that the job is not subject to the exception. As Wilkins explained: View this image  Responding to the ruling, Barretts lawyer, Bennett Klein from GLAD, told reporters on a call Thursday morning, Since the advent of marriage equality, we have seen efforts by religiously affiliated organizations to expand the grounds for exemptions from the obligation of nondiscrimination. The courts ruling affirms that a religious employer has no greater constitutional right to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation than it does to discriminate on the basis of a persons race or sex. A message seeking comment from Fontbonne Academy was left with the school. View this embed  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"No matter where you roam, you wont be alone. View this image  We decided to see which hook up apps designed specifically for gay men are used most around the world, based on the number of downloads in different countries. All data has been sourced from App Annie. The data is based on the number of downloaded apps through the iOS App Store and Google Play in August, a month chosen to keep the comparisons standardized.

You might be (rightly) thinking, What about queer women? We only mapped apps for gay dudes (and straight/mixed orientation apps in a separate map) because the market for apps specifically targeting lesbians is much less developed and couldnt be compared across borders in the same way. App Annie only identified two major apps targeting lesbians: LesPark, which is strongest in China, and HER, which has consistently ranked at around the 100th most popular free app in the U.S. Apple App store since July, on some days topping Grindrs downloads.

aS"The anonymous transgender woman is being held in a male prison and was fighting for access to external treatment, an MP has told the House of Commons. View this image  Parliament TV  A transgender woman injected bleach into her testicles and attempted to remove her own scrotum after allegedly being denied hormone treatment while in a male prison, an MP has told the House of Commons. Cat Smith, the Labour MP for Lancaster and Fleetwood, said the anonymous prisoner had been a victim of rape and sexual assault while incarcerated and was not able to continue the healthcare and medical appointments she had been having as part of her transition. She is a very vulnerable prisoner, with recorded serious attempts of self-harm, and attempts at suicide, Smith told parliament during a debate on the treatment of transgender prisoners. She began the transition process in 2008, and formalised her intention to remain living as a woman for the remainder of her lifetime in 2012. The MP went on to quote from a letter she had received from the prisoner: There is no knowledge of how suicidal I am because they dont care what impact their choices have on me physically and psychologically. Im totally destroyed, not the woman I was. I feel I will kill myself soon. I cannot do this now. Please will you help me? I cannot take no more Im a woman in a male prison. This is not right. Smith claimed the prisoner was still being denied access to her private hormone treatment, despite having won a court case on this matter at the end of October and having the backing of her local MP. While she continues to be denied the right to surgery and to be moved to a female prison establishment, she remains extremely vulnerable and at a very high risk of harm, Smith said. Examples of her self-harm have included injecting bleach into her testicles and attempting self-surgery to remove her scrotum. Smiths intervention and decision to hold the debate follows increased coverage of the treatment of transgender prisoners. Last month a vigil was held after Vicky Thompson, who identified as a woman, was found dead in an all-male prison. Caroline Dinenage, minister for equalities, said she accepted the current system may not sufficiently address the needs of transgender prisoners and said a forthcoming government review would reform how transgender prisoners are treated. She said reporting of some recent cases has been rather wide of the mark in some parts but insisted the government had the utmost commitment to the care and management of transgender prisoners.

aS"Rolston Ryan says hes built a life in Canada, and is desperate to stay. View this image  Ryan at the home of Joel Dick and Dara Doumas, where he lived for five months after arriving in Canada. BuzzFeed Canada Ryan talks about the night a decade ago when he was stabbed and taunted with homophobic slurs because he was gay. He just attacked me and started calling me all kinds of names like battyman [a slur for gay men] and kicked me, stabbed me, said Ryan. He details other acts of discrimination and violence he says he faced on the island of St. Kitts, the home he left in 2013 to seek refuge in Canada. But his applications for refugee status have twice been rejected. Hes applied for judicial review but failing that hell be sent back to St. Kitts, where he says life will be even harder than before he left. Gay sex is punishable by up to 10 years in prison in St. Kitts. Its really hard. Its very much illegal to be gay there. We have to be very much on the low when it comes to dating and doing anything thats gay, he said. View this image  BuzzFeed Canada He told his hearing adjudicator about these attacks, but she wrote in her decision that she didnt find him to be credible. Though they are called panels, refugee cases are decided by a single adjudicator. In this case it was Brenda Llyod, whom a 2014 analysis found to have among the lowest acceptance rate of cases. She questioned why Ryan didnt go to police after the stabbing attack. She also decided that although Ryan would face a serious possibility of persecution if he returned home, St. Kitts offered adequate state protection. I was just really scared for my life, too. That if I went to the police I would get attacked again, he said. Living there for so many years, I know, I know definitely theyre not about protecting us, especially gay people. Its pretty much illegal to be gay. If you get caught in any kind of sexual, any gay activities, you can be locked up. He says he went to police to report the robbery, but they didnt follow up on his case. Hes also been unable to obtain a record of his report, and suspects police never bothered to file one. View this image  Ryan making his first gingerbread house at Dick and Doumas home. Courtesy of Joel Dick I had nowhere to go, nowhere else to go. The island is very small, moving to another place is just like moving across the street, he said. I felt like I had no choice, that I had to live with it, until I found out about the whole refugee thing here in Canada, he said. A Canadian friend he met online told him that Canada gives refugee status on the basis of sexuality. That friend connected him with Rainbow Railroad, an organization that helps LGBT refugees get to Canada. They also set Ryan up with Joel Dick and Dara Douma, a Toronto couple who ended up taking him in for five months. Now, hes family. Dick and Douma who call him Roly took him skating for the first time, helped him make his first gingerbread house, and cried with him when his application was rejected. He now shares an apartment in the citys east-end and commutes two hours each way to a job at a bakery. Hes determined to be self-sufficient and hopes, if he stays, to attend business school and teach dance. Although he needed some time to adjust seeing two men holding hands in Torontos gay village was particularly jarring at first he feels like he can live freely. View this image  Ryan going skating for the first time. Courtesy of Joel Dick It would be crazy. All I know is it would be really crazy, everyone would know. Its really small, so everybody would know, he said. Itll be worse than what it used to be. Dick and Douma said theyve heard from several politicians, but there hasnt been any action yet. And time is running out. Its terrifying, said Douma. And for our country, Im so sad that thats who we are. That we want to send Rolston to certain persecution, thats so ridiculous to me.

aS"A new process allows people to tell Facebook if they have a special circumstance, though the policy remains the same. View this image  The policy, which requires people use their authentic name on Facebook, was being enforced with such rigidity that people with special circumstances including members of the trans community and advocates for certain political causes were often subject to process hell and long-term account suspension when reported as violators of the policy. Facebook is rolling out its new enforcement procedures, which add a more human aspect to the name confirmation process, with the intent of easing the road back to the platform for those unfairly reported under the policy. Facebook is not, however, changing a word in the letter of the law. We want to reduce the number of people who are asked to verify their name on Facebook when they are already using the name people know them by, the company said in a blog post. We want to make it easier for people to confirm their name if necessary. The enforcement changes are significant. Facebook is adding a I have a special circumstance, option for users reported as violators of the policy. When people are asked to prove their name and select that option, Facebook will put the case in the hands of its most experienced support representatives who will receive special training. Facebook is also forcing people who report a Real Name violation to provide context along with their report, a change which should help cut down on instances of the policy being used to inflict harm on others. The company is also promising to not remove a persons account as long as they are engaged with a support representative. The enforcement changes were promised after Facebook received a sternly worded letter demanding action from several groups including the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Human Rights Watch. The letter called the policy broken, and said Facebook maintains a system that disregards the circumstances of users in countries with low levels of internet penetration, exposes its users to danger, disrespects the identities of its users, and curtails free speech. View this image  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Stephen Lam / Reuters Though the enforcement changes will likely be welcome, its still unclear whether they will be enough to substantially change the negative experiences of those affected by the policy. The changes also seem to have overlooked some key issues, such as the fact that a person does not have to be Facebook friends with someone (the bedrock of connection on the platform) to report them as a real name violator. The company is also largely reliant on user reports, and its difficult to imagine people would cite people to Facebook unless they are upset with them in some way. Finally, Facebook requires significant documentation for someone to prove their name, which can be impossible to produce for people with shifting identities, such as those in the trans community, and political activists who use a pseudonym for safety. In an email, Facebook sent along a number of quotes from groups approving the moves, including one by GLAAD CEO & President Sarah Kate Ellis, who said: GLAAD looks forward to our continued work with Facebook to further improve on this policy and ensure that the worlds largest social network remains a place where all people can feel accepted and safe to be their authentic selves.

To be clear, Seven Sisters have at no time expressed any official statement regarding our position on trans inclusivity, but we are now seeking legal advice on this matter, hearing the voices of our patrons as well as engaging into dialogue with the transgender community. Therefore, as a part of maintaining the integrity of our community, in the next month, we will send a confidential survey to our fellow sisters who have and will be attending next years festival so they can share their opinions without fear of bullying. We believe this issue needs to be heard and we need to listen to every woman who has made Seven Sisters their sanctuary and home over the past four years. Our policy and festival content will be reviewed based on the responses to this survey and publicly posted on our website. Suggestions on how to improve Seven Sisters festival are welcome through this medium. As always, we strive to co-create the best Seven Sisters possible.

aS"The temporary order, which enforces the womans adoption of her ex-partners children, will remain in place while the justices decide whether to hear her case. View this image  Chris Geidner/BuzzFeed WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday granted a lesbian womans request to have the adoption of her former partners children be enforced while the court decides whether to hear her appeal of an Alabama Supreme Court ruling that the adoption was void. The U.S. Supreme Court has not yet said whether it will hear the appeal of the Alabama Supreme Court ruling, but on Monday granted the womans request that the state courts ruling be recalled and stayed until it decides whether it will do so. That request, filed in mid-November, features a complex case in which a lesbian couple in Alabama went to Georgia in 2007 so that one of those women, referred to as V.L. in court filings, could adopt the children of E.L. Years later, when E.L. and V.Ls relationship ended, V.L. sued in Alabama to have the adoption decree enforced for visitation and other parental purposes. Although a lower court sided with V.L., the Alabama Supreme Court ruled otherwise in September of this year, holding that the Georgia adoption was void because, the Alabama court maintained, it should not have been allowed under Georgia law. V.L. asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the decision and to put it on hold, in order to allow her visitation, while the high court decides what to do. Notably, the guardian ad litem the representative of the childrens interests in the litigation also weighed in at the U.S. Supreme Court, siding with V.L. and also asking for a stay. The U.S. Supreme Court action on Monday recalls the Alabama Supreme Courts judgment and puts it on hold until the Supreme Court decides whether to grant V.L.s petition for certiorari. If the petition is denied, the stay will terminate automatically. If cert is granted, the stay will remain in place until the final mandate from the U.S. Supreme Court is issued. No justices noted their disagreement with the order. Lawyers for E.L. are to file a response to V.L.s cert petition by Dec. 29, meaning that the justices could consider the petition in time to be heard this term, which would mean a decision by late June should they decide to hear the case.

View this image  My boyfriend, family, and best friends are so great about sending the random text or email or whatever to say theyre thinking of me especially when Im in a bad low and sometimes its the only thing that can pull me out of it. Arianna Rebolini View this image  When I was dealing with my illness, my friend learned my coping mechanisms and filled a box with things like silly putty, lotion, crayons, and encouraging notes. It was not only incredibly thoughtful and touching, but it really helped me. Thank you, Lexie. Katherine Fiorillo View this image  When I was going through depression, my friend (Allie) came over watched 500 Days Of Summer with me (yes, Im a sap). I pretty much was just sitting there crying like a mess next to her the entire time, and she was just there. Ive never forgotten about that. Brett Vergara View this image  I have ADD, and whenever I zone out, my friend calls me out but in this gentle, I get that you do this and its ok but hi, Im here! kind of way. It doesnt feel accusatory, like when some people say you only care when you talk, which genuinely isnt true. Plus, in general, me and her laugh all the time about everything, and those kinds of friendships only bring you good feelings. :) Julia Pugachevsky View this image  A little coffee and a snack can go a long way in making me feel better when Im feeling off. Getting out of the house and having someone to chat with while snacking are just extra bonuses! Karen Hobowsky View this image  When someones feeling low, even the simplest tasks can often seem overwhelming. Which means that the simplest gestures can be incredibly helpful. To make someone their favorite food is a wonderful and easy way to let them know that you care about them. Isaac Fitzgerald View this image  One of the most comforting things that my mom or my friends would do for me in college was give me head and hand massages. During anxiety attacks or while feeling super stressed out, the physical act of someone kneading my hand or scratching my head was incredibly calming. It was a closer way for me to feel safe. Christina Lan View this image  Every friend who has ever helped me feel better did so by just being there for me. If I open up to someone and they want to listen or grab some ice cream with me until I feel better, thats the most comforting feeling in the world. Anna Kopsky View this image  When I was really sad about a lame dating situation, my best friend made me a playlist of all my favorite happy songs. I lived alone at the time, so I used to just blast it in my apartment, and it helped me cheer up even when she wasnt there with me.  Annie Daly View this image  I can manage my sleep problems (insomnia, nightmares, sleep paralysis) but during periods of bad anxiety, they feel catastrophic. So there were nights when my best friend Carolina or my mom would sleep over with me in the same bed, even though Im a notorious sleep-kicker and thrasher. It made me feel calm, safe, and loved. Every peaceful night of sleep facilitated by them meant the world. Caroline Kee View this image  Sometimes, there isnt much you can do for a person whos struggling beyond listening and thats OK! I find that asking people questions about what theyre going through and then taking that in makes both of us feel more understood. The important thing to remember is that you dont *need* to have a response for everything. Just hearing a person out is enough. Julia Furlan View this image  The nicest things that anyone has ever done for me are running errands for me when Im too depressed to get out of bed or two anxious to leave the house. It doesnt have to be anything big; you dont have to do a full grocery shop for your friend. But when taking care of themselves feels impossible, coming over and quietly making them dinner, or bringing by some food, or offering to drop off and pick up their laundry can be huge, huge, huge. Same for finding a therapist helping them make the first calls or send the first emails can be the difference between getting help and not getting it. Little, considerate things! Kaye Toal View this image  In college, it took a letter from one of my best friends to finally make me realize that instead of trying to ignore and push down what I was going through, I should be dealing with it. Just letting me know that she recognized I was struggling (even from hundreds of miles away) and that she was there whenever I felt ready to talk, meant the world to me. Casey Gueren View this image  When youre depressed its almost impossible to remember who you are and how to love yourself. When things were especially hard, I would read letters, look at texts, or listen to old voice messages where my family and friends would list the reasons I meant so much to them and it would be enough to get me through each day. I could never express how thankful I am to have such wonderful, amazing people in my life. Shannon Rosenberg View this image  Something happened where I COULD NOT stop crying. Even though I knew my friend would think what I was crying over was stupid (yes, it was kind of stupid), she went out of her way to come over. She didnt validate the stupid stuff I was saying but she didnt shoot it down either it helped to know that someone was listening. I hadnt had an appetite in 2 days and another friend ended up coming over with fried chicken which I had jokingly asked for. I was instantly hungry and I now realize its my comfort food. Annie Yu View this image  I have friends who give amazing hugs and they let me hold on to them for as long as I need until I feel better. They dont have to say anything. It just helps to know that theyre there. Matt Ortile Sarah Kobos / BuzzFeed The unconditional love and to be honest, the distraction from anxiety and depression that a pet provides can be a lifesaver. Especially when they can sense that you are terribly sad or crying and they get all up in your space and lick your face and their breath is gross and somehow that makes you feel better. Emily Fleischaker View this image  When my brother passed away last year, my best friends took off of work and cancelled plans to come be with me at every wake and the funeral. And in the year since he died, theyve consistently gone out of their way to be at my apartment with me, wearing pajamas, watching movies on a Saturday night when I know theyd rather be out having fun somewhere. They never make me feel guilty about asking them to stay in. They show up without question and it makes me feel SO loved. Augusta Falletta View this image   Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Queer women who date despite significant age gaps challenge mainstream standards of beauty, rewrite stereotypical relationship power dynamics, and subvert a bunch of social rules regarding sex and love. But its not always easy. View this image  Greta Martela and Nina Chaubal are a queer couple with a 22-year age difference. Miley Cyrus for the Happy Hippie Foundations Happy Hippie Presents: #InstaPride According to their social media PDA, at least, actors Holland Taylor (age 72) and Sarah Paulson (age 40), are ridiculously, deeply in love. My colleague Sarah Karlan recently rounded up the sweetest tweets exchanged between the newly public couple. The post, which went viral, has garnered a largely mixed response, but with a definitive tilt toward Aw-Theyre-So-Cute-Im-Glad-Theyre-Happy. Ive seen nothing but positively gleeful reactions from the lesbian faction, who are thrilled that Peggy Peabody from the L Word is gaying it up IRL. But there are also plenty of people who are uncomfortable with Taylor and Paulsons 32-year age difference. One of the most-liked Facebook comments on the article reads: This is really gross. Not because they are gay, but because Sarah Paulson is dating the crypt keeper. View this image  Sarah Paulson and Holland Taylor. Getty images Depictions of significant lesbian age differences were mostly the stuff of subculture before this year, when a number of films pushed the phenomenon into the mainstream spotlight. Three films released in 2015 that centered on lesbian characters Paul Weitzs Grandma, Peter Solletts Freeheld, and most recently, Todd Haynes Carol all involved intergenerational romantic relationships. None were in wide release, but both Freeheld and Carol had big distribution backing, and Carol, which just got nominated for five Golden Globes, is well en route to mass critical acclaim. This year, a whole lot of people have watched lesbians of varying age differences fall in love and some witnesses have been nothing short of scandalized. That these age differences are oftentimes considered gross or salacious is pretty galling, since were all quite comfortable seeing older men date much younger women: Take all the James Bond films. Take Emma Stone, Scarlett Johansson, and Jennifer Lawrences entire careers. Everybodys cool with women dating up, so long as the older person theyre dating is a man. View this image  The Williams Institute Increased visibility for intergenerational lesbian relationships doesnt only shed light on the public discomfort they inspire these depictions also reflect the real-life lesbians whove been dating like this since the dawn of always. According to 2014 data compiled by the Williams Institute, 31% of married same-sex female couples have a 5- to 10-year age difference, compared to 21% of married different-sex couples; for 10-plus years, those numbers are 16% and 8%, respectively. Basically: This isnt a new, or rare, phenomenon. While naysayers insist that relationships like Holland Taylor and Sarah Paulsons dont make them uncomfortable for an explicitly gay reason, significant age differences between lesbians arent actually divorced from their queerness at all these differences are a nontraditional aspect of coupledom borne from queerness itself. Women who date significantly up or significantly down radically subvert heteronormative standards for whats appropriate when it comes to sex and love. Misunderstandings with warped oedipal undertones often plague queer women in intergenerational relationships. Once, the author and poet Eileen Myles was checking out at a store with a younger woman she was dating at the time, when the cashier asked her, How are you doing today, Mom? Myles, who recounted the incident during a recent phone call, groans. You want to put a stake through the guys heart. Myles, 66, has been romantically involved with a number of women a few decades her junior. The epigram which opens Grandma, Paul Weitzs 2015 film about a gay woman in her sixties and her teenage granddaughter, is a quote from Myles: Time passes. Thats for sure. Myles is clearly a model upon which Weitz crafted his titular character, played with some serious panache by Lily Tomlin: Shes a lapsed academic; shes a poet; and shes dating a younger woman, played by 40-year-old Judy Greer. In the newly released season two of Transparent, theres another distinctly Myles-like older dyke poet character (Myles and Transparents creator, Jill Soloway, are currently dating), who, when hanging around with a younger woman, deals with an awkward Is-that-your-girlfriend-or-your-daughter mixup. View this image  Lily Tomlin in Grandma. Sony Pictures Classics M, a 30-year-old living in Los Angeles with her partner, T, whos 19 years older, says they also receive some scrutiny when theyre out in public. (Both women requested not to be named for this story, to protect the sensitive nature of Ts professional life.) Strangers are always trying to figure out how theyre related. T has a 5-year-old son; when the whole family is out together, M is sometimes assumed to be the nanny. Race, too, is a contributing factor. As a mixed black woman, M says, that plays into [other peoples] assumptions whenever [T] walks into the room. M finds that when she does get prying age-related questions, they tend to be from straight men, who will openly question her and Ts compatibility. Ive been shocked at the audacity of that, says M. I dont go around asking people about their relationships. Straight men think thats OK to ask. Greta Martela, 46, and Nina Chaubal, 24, also say their relationship gets misinterpreted. The two started hanging out as just friends a few years ago, beginning with a trip to get their nails done. It was Chaubals first time at a salon, when both women were in the early stages of their gender transitions; a lot of traditionally feminine activities still had the sparkling sheen of newness. If wed been the same age, we would have hooked up that first weekend, says Martela. I didnt want her to feel taken advantage of later on. I just wanted to hang back and let her be a young woman in the city. Both women were living in the Bay Area at the time, working as software engineers. They joked about their jobs and Dungeons & Dragons. I hadnt had that close a friendship in years, honestly, Martela adds. We just kind of got each other, a right away thing. Being older, I realize how rare it is to really mesh with somebody like that. Their friendship inevitably evolved. This past March, they got married, and in April they moved to Chicago to build a life together. But theyre rarely read as the wives that they are. Were an interracial couple, a queer couple when were out, people dont normally make the connection, says Chaubal. Its that awkward thing socially, adds Martela. Like, Oh, is that your daughter? Ahhhhh. Stop. Power exchanges between women are always pathologized, Myles says. In an intergenerational lesbian relationship, according to public perception, [the older woman] becomes the mom predatory, pathologized and the younger person becomes someone who was abused, someone with with family issues. On and on. Myles thinks that public discomfort with significant age differences between queer women boils down to discrediting these womens agency. Female power is at the heart of this. View this image  Eileen Myles and Jill Soloway. Charley Gallay / Getty Images That an older lesbian is often assumed the Mother, either literally or figuratively, aligns with the ways we archetypically assign identities to women of a certain age. Mothers, and grandmothers even more so, are not usually afforded the status of sexiness. When internet commenters decried Sarah Paulson and Taylor Hollands relationship, there were a lot of people who assumed that Paulson could do better which certainly has nothing to do with Hollands talent and intellect (which are automatically called into question anyway) and everything to do with her 72-year-old body. Women become invisible in the aging process, says Myles. Were afraid of aging because of what will happen to us well be erased, become stupid and slow. The great female disaster is aging. With different-sex couples, its far more common to see a guy as the older figure in an intergenerational relationship, since an older man is a sugar daddy at worst; a suave, handsome, savvy gentleman at best. A woman, however, should she enter into a relationship with a much younger person, is desperate, sloppy, a cougar, an anomaly quite possibly a fetish. Queer people, as they are wont to do, often upset these cultural scripts. While same-sex female couples with significant age differences are more common than different-sex ones, same-sex male relationships are actually the most common of all: 25% of unmarried queer male couples have an age gap of 10 or more years between them. Though gay men dating intergenerationally can cause stirs (when 58-year-old Stephen Fry, the English actor, married stand-up comic Elliott Spencer this year, whos 30 years his junior, there were certainly some titters), it is older women, in particular, who are scorned for dating younger regardless of their sexuality. As Amy Schumer and Julia Louis-Dreyfus will tell you, every woman will face her last fuckable day all too soon. But queer women, at least, benefit from a certain level of liberation from traditional beauty ideals, which privilege the young and nubile. Many lesbians are capable of looking at other women in ways straight men have not been taught to look. A female face or body gets more interesting in age: cooler, deeper, says Myles. [Their] style, affectations, attitudes. Every single one of them has an eros. Whereas film and television have hammered home that straight womens sex appeal has an expiration date, the dearth of mainstream queer representation before the past decade can almost seem like a backward kind of blessing. We dont have so many years of media telling us what our relationships should look like, says Chaubal. Of course, queer people, who are freed from certain heteronormative restrictions, are not similarly liberated from the beauty and behavior standards established by white-privileging capitalism. When you look at the queer womens community in the big cities, [its all] young white girls, says M. In those circles, there are most definitely standards: Everyone has to look a certain way, a certain kind of queer, with their Tegan and Sara haircuts. The 19-year age difference between her and her partner, T, serves as its own kind of deliverance. We dont have to look a certain way, because we already dont fit a certain box. Thats because even though significant age differences are more common among queers than they are among straight people theyre still outside of the norm. Myles names the phenomenon: Dating much younger women has led to the experience of being treated as doubly queer. But even in gender-role-defying, expectation-smashing relationships like these, there are unavoidable obstacles. Theres a very big age difference between us, which Im sure shocks a lot of people, and it startles me, said Holland Taylor on WYNCs Death, Sex & Money, referencing her relationship with Paulson. But as they say, If she dies, she dies. This is something T and M think about too. I remind [M] all the time, T says. Im probably gonna die before her. And Im like, Lets just not talk about that right now, says M. View this image  Greta Martela and Nina Chaubal. Miley Cyrus for the Happy Hippie Foundations Happy Hippie Presents: #InstaPride For Martela and Chaubal, their worries about the future led them to seriously consider leaving the country. Martela cant imagine herself ever being in a financial situation that would allow her to retire in the U.S. They were already moving out of San Francisco, since it had become too expensive. They became enchanted with the idea of relocating to Sweden, where Martela planned to work for five years and then retire. When you get older, they take care of you which doesnt happen in our country, says Chaubal. They ended up deciding on Chicago instead, where they together started Trans Lifeline, a hotline for transgender people in need. But they havent stopped worrying about the decades to come. Because of the age difference, Ill be an old lady when shes still relatively young, says Martela. We dont talk about it much because its kind of depressing, says M. But thats the plan, to stay together. Im often reminded that we might not be here during the same time. T points out that no matter what happens, shell live on with in her son, whos now 5. Hell be around, so [M] and I can keep cruising together. The couple are also thinking about how to integrate a new baby into their busy schedules. In the end, despite uncertainties, some relationships are worth fighting for. Ninas gonna be my best friend for the rest of my life, says Martela. I expect our roles will shift depending on when we are in our lives. And I think thats beautiful. One of the particularly beautiful things about those roles, says Martela, is that they arent automatically demarcated by gender (the Older Male Breadwinner/the Younger Female Homemaker). Martela was primarily in straight relationships before transitioning in her forties. To be free of the heteronormative garbage that goes along with that is the most freeing thing in my life. Right after Martela and Chaubal moved in together, Martela lost her job. It was the first time in her career shed faced significant unemployment, while trying to stay afloat in a male-dominated field. She was out of work for a year. That would have been really difficult in a hetero relationship, but in a queer one it wasnt a problem, Martela says. Nina took care of me. While significant age differences between queer women remain a statistical norm, Myles has seen the landscape shift since she first arrived in New York City in the 70s. Then, she saw a good deal of intergenerational dating; now, theres an intensifying of difference as lesbians keep to their own insular peer groups, since they dont necessarily need or want to surround themselves exclusively with other queers were more welcome in mainstream society than ever before. In todays dating age, lesbians are finding one another on apps, unconsciously swiping according to a limited set of preferences, rather than picking each other up at queer bars and bookshops (where peoples ages are not as immediately apparent as they would be, say, in online profiles). Increasing queer acceptance is far from a bad thing, and apps also have plenty to offer (full disclosure: I met my girlfriend on Tinder). Social media, particularly for queer teens, has been nothing short of a godsend. We have a higher level of seeing now, Myles says of the internet. But, for better or worse, these changing trends in interaction do mark a distinct cultural shift in the way queers particularly of different generations are interacting with one another, up close and in person, in the post-marriage-equality age. Dating isnt the only way to build bridges between two queer eras, but its one of the simplest and most poignant. Especially in a time when the amorphous idea of Queer Community provided thats even a thing, or ever has been seems to be losing relevance and power, relationships between women of different ages are small and intimate microcosms of intergenerational queer connection. Im thrilled about what I learn from women and queers younger than me, says Myles. Chaubal, for her part, also says shes learned plenty from Martela. Weve been traveling a lot recently, so we decided to build ourselves a little camper trailer, she says. Some time many years ago, Greta used to be a metalworker. So theres stuff were doing right now thats possible because of experiences shes had in her life. And that is really cool. Martela clarifies that the learning goes both ways, even though shes the older person in their relationship. There are areas in which [Chaubal] is an expert. If she says somethings a bad idea, Im not gonna do it. We are both experts at different things. The idea of honoring womens expertise is, ridiculously, rather a radical one, especially when you take the stereotypes of womanhood at either end of a lifetime into account. Young women are supposed to be silly and naive and vain; older women are supposed to be slow and boring and clueless. When one dates the other, shes actively choosing to thwart such reductive expectations. I know how to fight for what I want, to say no, when to wait, says Myles. Ive been in time for 65 years. I have a lot to share. That supposedly should only be in my teaching life thats not the case. Its amazing on both sides to be able to share the world from different angles. Its lively. Its hot.

aS"While society sees my partners neuroatypicality as a disorder, I see it as a big part of why the two of us are so good for each other. But I havent spent too much time analyzing why our relationship works Ive been too busy loving him. View this image  Meredith Talusan / BuzzFeed News For our first date two years ago, Josh and I went to an interactive art show in Brooklyn, where an artist hugged people before taking pictures of their reactions. I suggested that Josh and I hug each other first, to test it out. After we embraced, and his heavy-lidded eyes stared into mine, I couldnt tell what he thought of me he had no expression on his face. I found the feeling both disconcerting and fascinating. As we talked at the opening, Josh told me he played the handpan, a type of steel drum that was invented a decade ago and has become really popular among street musicians. He went on and on about it. I told him I did dance improvisation, so I suggested we go to his apartment so he could play his drum while I danced. In his living room, I caught his spontaneous look of delight as I moved to his beat. That was my first inkling that Josh liked me, but I couldnt gauge his real interest based only on that reaction; he was impassive for the rest of our date. We got together a couple of weeks later, when he told me over bubble tea that he has severe ADD and is on the autism spectrum, unable to either send or read social cues nearly as well as other people. As a result, he also experiences a lot of social anxiety, because hes been routinely rejected from various social groups, both in school and at work, due to his inability to understand some social signals. My brain is like a serial processor, he explained between sips of taro ice crush, making use of a computer metaphor, which seemed appropriate. It processes things one at a time. Other people have parallel processors that are able to evaluate several things at the same time. He explained that social interactions are particularly hard for him because they require immediate parallel processing, judging not just the content of what people say but all sorts of other factors like his relationship to the person, the various nonverbal signals theyre exhibiting, and the larger social context in which he is interacting with them. Instead of running away in the face of these revelations, I found myself more drawn to Josh, finding so many of the ways he thinks and behaves both touching and charming. I adored his open enthusiasm for a broad range of subjects, from making paella to user interface design, and his lack of apology for being who he was. And when I explained that its customary for people who are dating to take less than 24 hours to respond to texts something he had a hard time doing because of his lack of attention I was deeply touched by how much of an effort he made to train himself to text me back, even setting alarms to remind himself so he wouldnt forget. Between extended discussions about typography, his efforts to make me the best japchae possible, digressions into World War I history, and his sweet, often bumbling attempts to act more like a typical boyfriend, I found myself falling in love. Unlike Josh, I am not a serial processor at heart. I make a lot of quick, intuitive decisions, gleaned from a holistic understanding of a situation. I jumped headlong into our relationship because the more Josh and I were together, the more I knew I wanted to see him again. I havent spent a lot of time analyzing why I love Josh; Ive been too busy loving him. But reflecting now has given me the opportunity to think through why our relationship works, and why hes actually a better match for me because hes neuroatypical. View this image  Meredith Talusan / BuzzFeed News I appear to many people like a socially confident woman who passes for cisgender. I move through the world in this form, and am mostly OK being perceived that way, but I actually live two realities. To myself, I am a gender-nonconforming transfeminine person whos experienced many struggles to get to where I am, and is often alienated by the world. For many years, I tried to hide this part of myself by appearing as normal as possible, which involved dating men who possess traditional markers of success: well-spoken, socially well-adjusted, stereotypically attractive. But over time, those men made me feel like they would end things between us if I revealed too much of myself. It didnt help that my suspicions proved to be true someone broke up with me because he wanted to have biological children, and another admitted that he felt ashamed when other people recognized me as trans. Its tempting to say that the reason Im with Josh is something as simple as the two of us both having disadvantages: me being trans and him being neuroatypical. But this idea turns love into a simple matter of economics your match is only as good as you yourself are worth and I dont think Im being over-romantic in believing that my love for him goes far deeper than that. Josh is the first person Ive dated who I feel like I can be fully myself with, in large part because I know that he routinely tunes out other peoples judgments. Whats widely perceived as a disadvantage finding it difficult to read social cues also means that Josh isnt preoccupied with how other people feel about his association with me. What matters most to him is the rapport between the two of us. Having lived most of my life inordinately concerned with how other people see me, being with Josh allows me to understand that what matters is not other peoples perceptions, but the reality I actually experience with him. In this image-driven, media-saturated world, which Josh pays little attention to, he constantly reminds me that its more important for us to be happy than to look happy, for us to feel attractive to ourselves than for other people to perceive us as attractive, for us not to conform to societys prescribed expectations of who to be and how to act. View this image  Meredith Talusan / BuzzFeed News Of course, our relationship isnt perfect, and there have been times when Joshs neuroatypicality has come between us. I once went out to dim sum with him and a couple of close friends, and I wanted him to make a good impression. Ive mentioned to Josh that its good to maintain eye contact, and to try to pay attention even when youre not particularly interested in what someones talking about, a nonverbal cue hes had a hard time grasping. Josh was fine for the first 30 minutes, but when we started talking about neighborhoods in New York, one of my friends wondered aloud what the most expensive areas are. Josh pulled out his phone to check Wikipedia and, as he tends to do, ended up spending the rest of the meal staring at his phone, only minimally paying attention to the conversation. I felt this ingrained fear of how his behavior might reflect badly on me because of our association, and how my friends would perceive me having an inattentive boyfriend. But I learned from his example that I shouldnt be overly concerned about the judgment of others, just like he has never made me feel like he cares how other people judge him because his girlfriend is trans. In the grand scheme of things, it didnt really matter that he needed to do something else because he was getting bored, since his ADD made it hard for him to concentrate for long periods of time. Josh may give the impression of not paying attention, but in reality, no one else has ever perceived or understood me better. Those who date neuroatypical people are often applauded for their charity, and the same is true for those who date trans people. But Im not with Josh because Im this overly generous creature who overlooks his neuroatypicality and is therefore deserving of a prize. Im with him because I fell in love with him as a whole person, including the aspect of his mind that is distinct from most other peoples. What society sees as a disorder, I see as a big part of why the two of us are so good for each other. Just as I dont think anyone should be considered brave for dating a trans person, I dont consider myself special for loving someone neuroatypical. I consider myself lucky that he loves me back.

aS"Kansas authorities are under fire for allegedly discriminating against same-sex families wishing to adopt or foster children, after a case of alleged child abuse thrust the issue out of bureaucratic secrecy and into the spotlight. Dr. Lisa Hines had just finished breaking down the babys nursery when she got a text message. It was a year after a Kansas court ordered an infant girl removed from her home with her wife, Tesa, and adopted by the Schumms a husband and wife who already had 14 other children. Hines read the message and immediately called Tesa, telling her to return to their Wichita home. When she pulled up, Hines ran out onto the porch. The Schumms, she said, have been arrested. On Nov. 19, some 140 miles away from the Hineses home, Jonathan and Allison Schumm, a Topeka City Council member and his stay-at-home wife, were arrested on child abuse and torture charges. Their children, including Isabella, were taken into protective care. The court decision placing Isabella in the Schumms home devastated the two social workers, plunging the women into a yearlong grief that nearly destroyed their marriage. The court decision also left the women feeling ostracized they said they believe that the only reason Kansas officials gave Isabella to the Schumms is because they are lesbians. They are not alone in making these allegations. The Hineses struggle is emblematic of the plight of same-sex families attempting to adopt or foster children in Kansas, LGBT advocates said a process that is shrouded in layers of bureaucracy and secrecy. Those advocates said that Gov. Sam Brownbacks administration has worked to block same-sex couples from adopting or fostering children. There are now growing calls for an official inquiry into the states Department for Children and Families (DCF). Court documents show that the Schumms were charged with aggravated battery or knowingly using a weapon to cause grievous bodily harm, disfigurement, or death; abusing a child or torturing or cruelly beating a child under 18; and four counts of endangering a child. The 16 children were placed in protective custody. Although the criminal case is under seal keeping many of the details of the charges out of the public realm the Shawnee County District Attorney has also filed two civil motions, referencing the charges, to have Jonathan Schumm removed or suspended from his elected position as a councilman. The district attorney alleges that between Oct. 7 and Oct. 11 this year, Jonathan took a 12-year-old child into a bedroom, forced him to lie on the ground, and whipped him with a leather and metal belt, lacerating the childs eye. Schumm is then alleged to have strangled the child and threatened to kill him, according to the documents. View this image  On Wednesday, Schumms attorney filed an objection to the motions, denying all the charges against his client and characterizing the case against Schumm as an accusation that he was overly zealous in disciplining his children. Tesa said she worries what Isabella was exposed to or subjected to while in the Schumms home. Im worried sick, she told BuzzFeed News. Im horrified that she had to witness any of that as a 2-year-old. Im just going crazy trying to understand what has happened to my child, Lisa told BuzzFeed News. I want her to be safe and I need to know, and Im not going to stop until I find out. Kari Schmidt, the Hineses attorney, said she was stunned to learn the news. I almost vomited, she said. And Im not kidding. Schmidt said the court officials should have foreseen problems in the Schumm household because of the extremely large number of children, the familys limited income, and their small home issues officials had raised in the past. It defied logic, she said. Every step of the way it defied logic.  Lisa and Tesa met in 2006 at a San Francisco conference on children who witness domestic violence. Lisa, now 50, was a presenter, and Tesa, 36, an attendee. They became friends, and Lisa dated around while waiting out Tesas relationship with another woman. I told one woman that if Tesa becomes free were going to have to break up, Lisa bashfully admitted. In 2008, they married in the brief period when same-sex marriage was legal in California. And by 2010, unable to afford a good life in San Francisco, they headed to Kansas, where Lisa accepted an assistant professor of social work position at Wichita State University. The transition came as a shock. I thought that St. Louis, where Im from, was conservative, Tesa said, and it doesnt hold a candle to Wichita. For years, the pair thought about starting a family. After spending thousands of dollars in unsuccessful attempts to get Tesa pregnant, they looked to become foster parents. The first set of four girls they took in at the one time stayed only a few months after the childrens grandmothers objected to them living with lesbians. Then, the phone rang: A 5-day-old baby was in need of a home. Isabella not her legal name but the name the couple has always called her arrived at the Hineses house right from the hospital on Nov. 13, 2013. She was 5 days old, still wearing the plastic medical bracelet around her ankle. She had on a brand-new baby blanket, and one of the little baby caps that they put on them, Lisa said. She smelled so good. I fell in love with her. View this image  A photo of Isabellas hand with the Hineses. Kit Doyle for BuzzFeed News They had just days to prepare. Lisa rushed to the store to buy baby goods, including a bassinet they placed between them in bed. At night, Isabella slept with her tiny hands wrapped around the womens fingers. From the beginning, the Hineses knew they wanted to adopt Isabella. With their marriage not recognized in Kansas at the time, it was Lisas name that would appear on all the paperwork. But around Thanksgiving, Tesa said they received an email from a state contractor: Another family wanted to adopt Isabella.  Isabella was born to a woman who previously had seven children removed from her custody, according to a court petition Lisa filed. Two of Isabellas half siblings were removed from their biological mothers legal custody between 2006 and 2009 and adopted by one family; her other five half siblings were adopted by Jonathan and Allison Schumm in 2013. At the time, the Schumms had four biological children and two sets of five adopted children already living in their home meaning they were barred from fostering Isabella due to a state regulation that said their house didnt have enough rooms. So they sought to adopt her, which had no such hurdle. (In addition to Isabella, its believed the couple had also since taken in Isabellas younger sibling. Allison is also understood to be pregnant with another child.) By February, visitations between Isabella and her half siblings were taking place. The meetings were supervised by Saint Francis Community Services, a faith-based group and DCF contractor, at one of the organizations offices. All 14 of the Schumms children at the time were brought along to bond with the infant, according to the Hineses. (All statements about the adoption case are from Lisa Hines publicly available petition to the Kansas Supreme Court, unless otherwise noted. The Schumms and their lawyers did not return a request for comment on all statements regarding the family. Spokespeople for the DCF and Saint Francis said they could not comment on specific cases. However, Justin Thaw, an adoption supervisor for Saint Francis, told BuzzFeed News, In a case where one family may become adoptive to a child, there would obviously be some interaction with all the children in that family.) View this image  Tesa Hines holds footprints of Isabella in the childs old nursery, now an office, in the Hineses Wichita home. Kit Doyle for BuzzFeed News The Hineses felt the visitations disrupted the bonds they developed with Isabella. If I put myself in Isabellas shoes, that would be traumatizing, Tesa said of the meetings. If somebody, some stranger, just picked me up, took me from my parents, and then took me to a crowd to be touched, that would be traumatizing for me. On March 24, 2014, Isabellas biological parents had their rights formally terminated by a Sedgwick County judge. The Schumms and the Hineses both applied to adopt her. Despite assurances from Saint Francis, which makes recommendations, and DCF, which makes the final call that they were being equally considered as adoptive parents, Lisa and Tesa began to feel Isabella was slipping away from them. The 30-minute visitations increased to an hour. When Lisa questioned if the change meant the DCF social workers were treating the meetings as pre-adoptive visits, she said she was met with no response. The formal meeting to determine who should adopt the baby was scheduled for July 31 but the decision had already been made, the Hineses believe. The couple said a Saint Francis social worker told them on June 6 that the baby would most likely go to the Schumms. Thats just the way it is, the Hineses said the social worker told them. In response, Saint Francis Communications Director Vickee Spicer told BuzzFeed News, Best practices would dictate that children are placed with family, which, in this case, was with the siblings the Schumms already had, and therefore, preference would most likely be given to the Schumms. We dont want to deny children the opportunity to grow up with family and allow the siblings to bond and grow together. At the formal meeting, the Schumms were selected as the most suitable adoptive parents. According to an internal Saint Francis letter cited in the Hineses court papers, Saint Francis opined that both families were appropriate placements, but broke the tie in favor of the Schumms solely on the basis that they adopted [Isabellas] former half siblings. On Oct. 2, the Hineses got Isabella ready for day care, dropped her off, and kissed her goodbye as they went to court. There, the judge denied their attempts to block the girls temporary weekend visit to the Schumms pending the courts final decision on who the parents would be. Isabella was driven to Topeka that afternoon. The following day, as the Hineses mulled their next legal move, a Saint Francis social worker filed an abuse/neglect critical incident report, according to Lisa Hines court petition, recommending Isabella not be returned to the Hineses because she had eczema, thrush, and asthma. Isabella was indeed suffering from diaper rash, the Hineses told BuzzFeed News, but none of her doctors or social workers had ever reported any suspected neglect or abuse before. The timing of the report meant Lisa Hines was not entitled to a 30-day notice of removal of the foster child, which could have delayed the formal transfer. A DCF attorney informally contacted Kari Schmidt to say the claims had been investigated and were found to be unsubstantiated, according to the Hineses, but the formal DCF finding was not made until weeks later. Saint Francis chose not to return the child to the Hineses, they said, because the group felt it was easier to simply leave Isabella with the couple they and the court had chosen for adoption. Lisa Hines filed an appeal to the state Supreme Court on Oct. 27, which declined on Dec. 1 to hear the case. With money, time, and their will to fight on at an end, the Hineses admitted defeat. They realized that the morning they dropped her off at day care would be the last time theyd see her. View this image  Lisa (left) and Tesa Hines return Isabellas items to storage in the basement of their home. Tesa said that doing laundry is always painful now because she must be around the items. Kit Doyle for BuzzFeed News DCF used the pretext of a bogus neglect charge in order to avoid the legal duty to give my clients notice of the move that we could have then gone into state court and contested, Schmidt said. That was the part at the end of the day where I believed that there was nothing that was going to stop the DCF from giving that child to Jonathan and Allison Schumm. Despondent and grief-stricken, Lisa retreated to her room, closed the curtains, and cried for seven days. Tesa tried to comfort her, but eventually the shock caught up with her too. Tesa began criticizing Lisa for not doing more to keep Isabella. The pair argued more and more. Tesa moved out to go stay with her mom for a few months, leaving Lisa alone in the empty home the babys room still untouched as if she might someday come home.  Allison Schumm liked to say that her family exploded. In less than three months in 2006, she and her husband went from having no children to having five. Four were foster children, all siblings, ranging from 10 months to 10 years old. The fifth was a girl Allison gave birth to in October. By December, the couple had also taken in the foster childrens 5-month-old sister. The honeymoon period with these children did not last long, she told a parenting blog in 2013. The day after the foster children arrived, she let three of them play unsupervised in front of the home, she said in the parenting blog. Some of the kids threw rocks at an adjacent building, she said, breaking 12 windows. At this point I was starting to realize just 24 hours prior we had taken in furious vandalizing thieves and liars, she wrote in an archived version of her own now-deleted blog titled the Schumm Explosion. She said she and her husband punished the children ages 6, 7, and 10 by making them haul twelve 40-pound buckets of rocks across the yard. Allison wrote she was determined to ensure the children felt loved and had a stable home. Crucial to that was her desire to keep siblings together. She revealed to the parenting blog that, as a child, she was adopted by one family while her sister was adopted by another family and was separated from Allison and their two brothers. She saw the pain and turmoil it had [caused] her sister and she wanted to be able to protect children from having to go through this agonizing separation, the blog reads. View this image  The couple are devout Christians and have said they have faith in a higher plan. When asked during foster training classes how many children the couple hoped to have, she wrote that the Schumms replied, as many as God will provide. We learned very quickly that if you give God [an] offer like that, He will take you up on it, she wrote. If our desires truly matched Gods, He would provide for and make them happen. After adopting the five foster children in June 2008, Allison gave birth to a son about three months later, and then another daughter in December 2009. The couple had had eight children in five years. To Kansas officials, the Schumms were the poster family for adoption. In 2011, the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services asked the couple to speak at an event championed by Gov. Sam Brownback to increase adoptions. The state had more than 5,000 children in the foster care system, and another 900 awaiting adoption. So many kids are still waiting, Jonathan told reporters. View this image  The Schumms home in Topeka, Kansas. Google Maps It was around this time, Allison said, that the couple began looking at adopting five more children Isabellas siblings. Allison was already pregnant with another boy, but the couples hearts were set. The DCF, however, wasnt so sure. Allison told the parenting blog that department officials initially refused their first request to adopt because of the familys size and the needs of the children. They were crushed. But unlike the Hineses, the Schumms were granted a second chance. Many people had already been working behind the scenes to get the DCF to change their mind about the adoption, Allison said. Our friends and family wrote countless letters explaining our hearts and support system. In December, just a month after Allison gave birth to her son, the DCF said they could also adopt the five other children. But the process was paused when allegations were made to DCF against the couple, Allison said. However, they were eventually proved false, Allison said, and the adoption was finalized on July 23, 2013. Now with 14 children and a husband at work, Allison wrote she was overwhelmed, especially since the couple chose to homeschool their kids, according to local reports. I know I have my moments when I cant wait for Jonathan to get home so that I can go hide in my room, but its not because I dont want to be around my children, its because sometimes 14 of them can become a bit overwhelming at times, she confessed on her blog. Meanwhile, Kansas officials praised the couple. Sen. Jerry Moran, Kansass junior senator in Washington, nominated them for a congressional Angels in Adoption award and met with them in the capital in October 2013. Their compassion and commitment has given their children both a family and a bright future, he said. Just weeks later, Isabella was born.  The Hineses are not the only same-sex couple to battle the DCF. Tom Witt, executive director of Equality Kansas, the states top LGBT group, told BuzzFeed News that he has spoken personally with three other LGBT couples who have approached his organization for advice in their fight with the department. (He declined to name them, citing their wish to remain private.) Recently, though, details of another case with striking parallels to the Hineses were released this month. A judge in Johnson County, Kansas, shared a copy of a 2013 court decision the names were redacted in which she took the extraordinary step of removing a child from the DCFs custody after finding the department hadnt acted in the boys best interest by removing him from his lesbian foster parents. According to the judges decision, after social workers recommended the same-sex couple as the adoptive family, an email was sent to DCF officials by a department staff attorney noting the couples sexuality. The emails were immediately forwarded by the departments assistant regional director, Marcia Simoneau, to the head of the DCF, Phyllis Gilmore, and flagged as a high priority. In a meeting then held to discuss the child, Simoneau wrote she was concerned the boy would lack a father figure or be teased in school, Judge Kathleen Sloan found. After launching a lengthy investigation into the couple that found one of the women had previously committed welfare fraud, the DCF eventually recommended the child be adopted by a heterosexual couple who had first declined to take the boy. (They had already adopted his half siblings.) The department, however, had previously consented to placing children with couples for adoption in cases involving far more serious crimes, the judge wrote. In essence, DCF conducted a witch hunt and made a concerted, purposeful effort to obtain negative information because they are homosexual women in a committed relationship, Sloan wrote. The judge found DCF workers had done the bidding of Secretary Gilmore who Sloan said was deeply involved and directing the course of the case and placed their concerns for the gay/lesbian classification above concerns for the childs best interest, contrary to established law. [Simoneau and Gilmore] were clearly alarmed that this child might be adopted by a gay couple, the judge wrote. View this image  Witt, with Equality Kansas, said that Gilmore needed to resign for trumping up and fabricating reasons to remove children from same-sex couples. The Brownback administration is going out of its way to hassle and attack people in a way that escapes most public scrutiny, he said. It feels like retribution against gay and lesbian families in a way that cant really be reported easily, in a way where they can escape accountability. The DCF denies it has a formal policy of barring same-sex couples from fostering or adopting children. This agency has no policy regarding same-sex couples, Theresa Freed, DCFs communications director, told BuzzFeed News. Well, we know that, Lisa Hines said. They dont have a formal policy. Its an informal policy and everyone seems to know it because thats how they practice. View this image  Gov. Sam Brownback (left) shakes hands with Department for Children and Families Secretary Phyllis Gilmore after signing a welfare reform bill into law in Topeka, Kansas, April 16, 2015. Orlin Wagner / AP Photo Its a red herring statement, Kari Schmidt said of the DCFs denial. You can yell from the mountaintops, We dont have a policy of denying gay and lesbian couples opportunities to adopt and foster children, but if in practice you are doing that, then you are in fact doing that whether you have a stated policy or not. Rep. Jim Ward, a Democrat who represents Wichita in the state legislature, on Thursday requested legislative auditors investigate the DCF over what he says is systemic discrimination against LGBT individuals. I was sick to my stomach when I first learned of this, Ward told BuzzFeed News. It seemed that DCF was promoting their agenda, this bigotry which says, We are going to prohibit people who are qualified to be parents because we dont agree with their lifestyle. View this image  At the meeting Thursday, Ward submitted an open letter signed by 17 attorneys and three social workers. Whether these claims are true or not, the letter reads, the specter of alleged wrongdoing by the Department for Children and Families now clouds cases which are already difficult enough. The Legislative Post Audit Committee did not immediately agree to Wards request, instead opting to create a subcommittee to develop a proposal for an audit of the department. It is very frustrating because they could have taken the first step today, Ward told local reporters Thursday. Prior to the Schumms arrest, legislators convened a special committee on foster care adequacy. The committees focus is broad, but its chair, Sen. Forrest Knox, a Republican, seems obsessed with considerations of family structure. In an opinion piece he sent BuzzFeed News, Knox wrote he was concerned for children. The medias issue of the day, homosexual rights, seems to trump all, he wrote. There is no right of certain people or classes of people to be licensed foster parents. Allison and Jonathan Schumm are seen in mugshots provided by the Shawnee County Sheriffs Office. In his notes for the committee, Sen. Knox lists a number of news items and scholarly articles that question whether the children of same-sex couples suffer negatively, including nine pieces by a Kansas State University professor of family studies by the name of Walter R. Schumm Jonathans father. Throughout his career, Walter Schumm has authored a number of pieces on the risks associated with gay and lesbian parenting, including a controversial study arguing gay couples were more likely to raise gay children. Schumm is routinely cited by people who argue against LGBT couples raising children. In 2008, he was called on by Florida officials to give expert evidence in a case against a gay man who challenged his states ban on LGBT individuals adopting children. But a judge for the Florida trial court mocked the idea that Schumms mostly unpublished [research] should be accepted over the analyses of well respected researchers in peer reviewed journals. The court of appeal which overturned the ban on same-sex adoption also found the lower court was entitled to accept testimony from UCLA and Cambridge University professors that Schumms research contained fundamental statistical errors. Dr. Schumm understands that much of the scientific community disagrees with his conclusions and concedes to the possibility that some gay parents may be beneficial to some children, the trial court found. In emails to BuzzFeed News, Professor Schumm said it would be premature to comment on his sons case, as he did not know the facts. However, he said he viewed his academic work not as anti-gay but more as antibad research. Walter Schumm, who has said on multiple occasions that lesbians tend to have less stable relationships than heterosexual mothers and fathers, described himself as even-handed. Dr. Hines should have asked me to take her side inasmuch as I have found no evidence whatsoever that would indicate that lesbian mothers could not care for an infant as well as anyone else, he wrote. Now if you look at adolescent or adult outcomes that might be a different story. In 19951996, Walter Schumm served on a family impact panel for then-Congressman Sam Brownback, and worked as his statistical analyst, according to his curriculum vitae. I reviewed a couple pieces of legislation and commented on them, the professor told BuzzFeed News. I dont know if he didnt like what I did or if I took too long or what, but after a while he stopped asking me to review things.

Brownback played some part in the DCFs decision to place Isabella with Schumms son. I dont think it takes rocket science to connect those dots, Schmidt said. In response, Brownbacks spokesperson, Eileen Hawley, said, The first priority of the Department for Children and Families is the best interest and welfare of the child. Placements are made in accordance with state and federal regulations that require a preference be given to keeping siblings together and placing a child with family members whenever possible.

We havent even talked about whether theres an appetite to do anything, Schmidt said. However, Lisa and Tesa said they have told the relevant agencies that if Isabella is cleared for foster placement they would like to be considered. The couple are also back together in their Wichita home, packing the last few boxes of Isabellas things. This last year has been the worst year of my life, Tesa said. It really has, but I dont think I could have gotten through it I know I couldnt have gotten through it if I hadnt come back and given my marriage another try.

Thats one that sort of walked around with us, as a family. The father of three added that when strangers asked about his wifes tattoos, it would create an uncomfortable situation to always have to explain the image of Ace, who is now 15 years old. Instead of having his wife undergo laser removal of the tattoo, Steve decided to simply update the portrait. On his Facebook page, Steve wrote, We need to update the tattoo to fully represent who he is in his happy new awesome life. I think it really reaffirmed, for him, that we believed him, said Steve.

aS"Were told that love conquers all. But sometimes antidepressants help, too. Always consult with your doctor about your personal health and wellness. BuzzFeed posts are for informational purposes only and are no substitute for medical diagnosis, treatment, or professional medical advice. View this image  Jenny Chang / BuzzFeed Life One afternoon, two and a half years ago 10 months before our wedding my now-husband and I stood in our kitchen in Houston, arguing about chores. Again. Why do we keep having this argument? Why did I keep asking you to do things, and you agree to do them, and then you justdont do them? I said, like I had said so many times before. He apologized, like he had so many times before. And then he said, so sadly, Its justgetting through my day is so overwhelming, I just dont have the energy to do anything else. There was something about the way he said it that left me feeling like Id stepped into a commercial for antidepressants. Oh, I said. I think I know whats going on. But despite the many therapy sessions and doctors and prescriptions and really good days since that lightbulb moment, there are still a lot of days when I feel like I dont know whats going on. The ways in which mental illness can affect intimate relationships often go against the cultural narrative about what a good or happy marriage looks like. Were told that a good husband or wife is thoughtful, attentive, generous, social, and sexual. And if a partner isnt one of those things, its because one of you isnt good enough, or doesnt love the other enough. Were always told that love conquers all. But sometimes antidepressants help, too. View this image  Jenny Chang / BuzzFeed Life For the one with mental illness, there is the illness itself, plus a whole host of other feelings: the vulnerability that comes with letting someone truly see you as you are, the anger when they dont get it, the guilt when they reassure you, the shame that you arent easily fixed, the fear that one day theyll give up on you. For the partner, theres the confusion over whats causing your partner to act in ways that often defy reason, the worry that theyll hurt themselves, the disappointment when they break promises, the guilt when you remember its not their fault, the shame that tells you its your fault, the fear that one day theyll give up on you. But thousands of couples dont give up. After I put out a call for stories about mental illness in relationships, I received about 175 emails from people who were willing to share their story. All but three were stories of hope, love, and support. People were incredibly honest about some of the worst days of their lives. Mostly, they wanted everyone else going through it to know they arent alone. Below are stories from four of the couples who reached out: Matt and Justin (ADHD) Jordan and Justin (Bipolar disorder and painkiller addiction) Khakan and T (OCD and bulimia) Nancy and Dan (Bipolar disorder and postpartum depression) View this image  Jenny Chang / BuzzFeed Life Justin has ADHD. Justin: I did not receive an official ADHD diagnosis until the summer after my first year in undergrad. Looking back, I charmed my way through high school with an outgoing, kind, and energetic personality in addition to a pretty great smile. When I got to college, things were very, very different. There, I was suddenly responsible for my own organization and motivation. Things fell apart, and that initiated my decision to talk to someone. I met with a psychologist who asked if I had ever considered that I have ADHD. Looking back, all the pieces fit together. I then went for a full psychological evaluation, and the results screamed ADHD. Matt: We have been together for over nine years first as college roommates, but of course we didnt date for two years (imagine the drama?!). It wasnt until we moved out of the dorms that we connected. We continued to date through college and his long-term grad school (getting his doctorate in school psychology) in upstate New York. Justin is my world. My everything. Hes my rock. At first, as a roommate, Justin was just a friend with ADHD. And a friend with ADHD is nothing but a good time. Up for anything, always on the go, and more than happy to give you some pretty memorable college memories. As a boyfriend, ADHD means so much more. Broken conversations. Forgotten anniversaries. Waiting for a ride. Misunderstanding. Mood swings. It can mean sitting in utter and complete silence on date night, or it could mean watching your partner spiral into overnight manic study sessions to barely finish a paper. Justin: Living with ADHD can be difficult. I tend to either act without thinking, or not act because of overthinking. It is difficult to follow conversations Im involved with. Matt: It also means unbridled joy. Childlike fun. Getting lost in the moment. And even, at times, understanding that you are the complete and total center of someones attention. At first, you may never really know which person youre talking with or what you said to make them even more upset. But in time, we learned how we each worked. One night, sitting in bed, Justin explained to me just what goes on in his head on a daily basis. You know that little voice you hear when you read to yourself? he said. Well, I dont have one. That was a breakthrough. Justin went on how to explain how sometimes we can chat or reason with our inner selves. But his brain simply does not work like that. For him, things arent necessarily thought about; they are decided in the moment. Meeting new people, remembering names, or following conversation is like mental gymnastics sometimes he can stick his landing, other times he may fall. What does a good day look like? Matt: I think a good day is us just spending some time together. Firing on all the same cylinders. Sleeping in, but not too in (leave it to Justin and he would be in bed till 4 p.m. every day). A movie and a dinner date. I like to think we are like big kids (he definitely helps with that), so hitting up a toy store or going laser-tagging is always a good time. Justin: Good days are us being on the same page. Laughing, chilling on the couch, remembering to follow through with things, having a quality conversation. A really good day is me being on time. View this image  Jenny Chang / BuzzFeed Life What does a bad day look like? Matt: A bad day would be a mood shift. If I feel frustrated because I feel like hes not chatting or too scattered to focus, I shut down. Then, just when I am getting out of a funk, his mood dips. Those are the worst days. Justin: Not following through with things, forgetting things in the apartment when leaving, not remembering to bring up a topic and being completely distracted and unfocused. Matt needing to tell me things three and four times before it registers or sticks. Matt: Our relationship was long-distance for three years. That was our most frustrating and rocky time. Our relationship eventually turned into utter and complete routine; a good morning text, perhaps a midday phone call, an I am leaving work text, and a forced goodnight phone call. When he was free, I was crashing from a full 10-hour workday. Plus, him trying to juggle school meant that he would forgot to ask about important parts of my day; how grandma is feeling after surgery or how that big interview went. I misinterpreted his lack of communication as not caring. He later told me he would remember about that job interview or big film shoot days later, when something triggered his memory, but he felt it was so many days old it wasnt worth mentioning. We just werent syncing when we werent together. A few times I went upstate with the mindset of breaking up, but once we were back together it reminded me of why we were together. Our silliness, friendship, and love were refueled with each of those trips. Justin has told me now he sensed my real purpose for going up there, but did his best to ignore it. That was the hardest period in our relationship, but we got through it. I feel that if we were able to overcome that three-year rough patch, anything is possible. Has his mental illness affected your sex life? Matt: I would say its definitely killed the mood sometimes. Who wouldnt want to come home on a Friday after a long week to see your perfect man cooking up some juicy chicken parm in nothing but his skivvies and an apron? (Hey, its my fantasy.) Instead, Justin is walking around in circles trying to clean the house, with the TV blasting, underwear all over the floor, and no idea whats for dinner. What has helped you two manage ADHD as a couple? Justin: [For people with ADD or ADHD], have patience with [your partner] and with yourself. Dont beat yourself up over the difficulties. It is a part of who you are. Own it and grow. Be as open with your significant other as you can. It will be difficult at times, but it will be your biggest asset in a successful relationship. [For partners], read up. The time you invest in reading about ADHD will pay off. Have patience. Understand that it is difficult for us to communicate what is going on or how we feel because we may not know ourselves. Try not to take things personally. Matt: Nine years in, I definitely know Justin in and out. If I see that he is struggling to find a response or process something mentally, I will just say, Think about what you are trying to say, take your time. We take a moment, pause, and then speak. From small daily tasks to weekend plans and everything in between, repetition is key. Also, time apart is a must! Sometimes, like any relationship, you are just on two separate wavelengths and need a break. I dont think that really has anything to do with ADHD, but if he or I are having a rough day, it can make it worse. I am not a teacher, I am not a banker, I am not a motherbut it can often be difficult not to take on a piece of these roles in daily life with someone with ADHD. Questions like Did you pay your credit card bill? Did you take your medicine? Did you finish your grad paper? Did you do your answers for the nice BuzzFeed lady? can come off as accusatory or nagging. Unfortunately, I need to ask those questions to make sure the bills were paid on time! If I am starting to be a pest, Justin just says something or gives a look. Hes really good at those looks. Do you have any fears about the future? Matt: Who doesnt? I think my biggest fear is traveling the path of life together with one person, who may get a little distract oh, squirrel! But I wouldnt want to take this journey with anyone but Justin. Justin: My biggest fear is that the mental and emotional effort it takes to be with me will get to be too much for Matt. I make valiant efforts, but things dont always pan out the way I hope. I love Matt with all my heart, and deep down truly believe we can overcome any obstacle. What do you love about each other? Matt: Justin is one of the kindest people in the world. Clich, I know, but he will literally give you the shirt (usually a sweatshirt) off his back. Hes sensitive, and will put others first, all the time. Plus, what made me fall in love with him was his general enthusiasm. His eyes light up even at the simplest of things. He makes you stop and re-evaluate whats really important in life. He just makes you feel loved, unconditionally. Justin: He doesnt give up. Always ready to learn and grow. He accepts me for who I am; sees me as a complete picture. I know he ALWAYS has my back. He is supportive, dedicated, and can be the BIGGEST pain in the ass. I love the look in his eyes when he looks at me. The world stops in the little moments, like meeting eyes from across a crowded room. Matt: We may never be able to sit down and debate the latest breakthroughs in astrophysics, but who cares? Thats not us. Thats not who we are. We know how we each think, act, and more importantly love. I could never love another person more that I love Justin. Justin doesnt just have ADHD; we do.

Jordan: I have known Justin since we were 13, and he was my first boyfriend ever. We have been on and off for years and years because of normal life junk. He has a daughter from another relationship, and I have two from a previous marriage. He always had issues, according to his family, and I believe they did right by what they knew. Justin: I was a 90s kid with ADD/ADHD. So, my mom and dad had me seeing a doctor at the age of 6. From then until I was 17, I have been on every pill they could throw at you for ADD. Jordan: There was never any real improvement, and his family just started to ignore his perceived issues. He came back into my life five years ago, after I got divorced and while he was in the U.S. Navy. We all thought the Navy was going to be a godsend for him: structure, doing something he could be proud of. But he is one of the many that the military was not the greatest idea for, in regards to his emotional and mental health. In my most humble opinion, there is not enough screening for emotional and mental health for our servicemen and -women prior to joining. In 2009, Justins second year in the Navy, he started to develop anxiety. Justin: I started having very strange thoughts. For example, I would be talking to someone I respect and would have a flashing thought: spit in their face. Of course I would not act on it, but sometimes the thoughts would get to the point that I would be mistaken as disrespectful because I would have to walk away from a conversation. This was the first time I really noticed something was off. Jordan: He, like many, went to his C.O. and to the Navy docs for help, and was put on benzos and painkillers, which are highly addictive. Justin got out of the Navy in 2011. Jordan: Even though it was hard at times, he missed his Navy buddies and that life so much. His self-image and self-worth declined rapidly as he became more anxious and dependent on the medicines prescribed to him. He had what we referred to as an alter ego, named Brett, when he would slip into his moods. It became clear there was something more going on. We went through the VA, like we were told, to get him help. The VA is the most depressingly unorganized joke of a hospital. They lost his chart and diagnosis multiple times. He was finally diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and on top of that was slowly becoming addicted to the Xanax and hydrocodone that they had him on. Jordan said the couple spent thousands of dollars on non-VA doctors, who all recommended lithium as treatment. The VA doctors wouldnt take the recommendations of the other physicians, but since Justin didnt have insurance, he kept going to the VA doctors, who prescribed several other medications. Justin: I truly believe that today I am still recovering from the effects of the poorly managed health care I received. There were so many nights adjusting to new medicines. I would wake up screaming, if I actually fell asleep at all, due to reactions to the pills. It would make my skin feel like it was crawling, like I had bugs living inside of me. I was having the worst nightmares you could imagine. It was absolutely terrifying to go to sleep. So they put me on sleeping pills. Jordan: It took the VA a year of failures and horrifying experiences to finally try lithium, which is one of the most common treatments for bipolar disorder. He went through so much. He would be so exhausted he couldnt get out of bed, would have emotional outbursts of every kind, would be super-needy all of a sudden and suffocating in the relationship, have insomnia spells, would go completely numb and coldhearted, etc. But through all of this he managed to get two degrees in school. Justin is no longer addicted to pills; Jordan says he got over the addiction relatively quickly with the help of a functional medicine doctor. Justin: I still have a hard time understanding what is my disorder and what is real. I have some of the most wicked depression, to the point it is not fair to a spouse. There are days when I have literally not been able to drag myself out from under the covers because the voice inside of me also likes to tell me how much of a failure I am and he likes to make sure I know when I am having an off day. While I am being consumed with my own self-loathing, my wonderful loving partner has no idea what is going on and doesnt hear from me for days. I will go without paying my phone bill on purpose because deep down, I do not want anyone to be able to get ahold of me. Jordan, are you able to reassure him when hes feeling guilty or seeing himself as a failure? Jordan: It is really hard to reassure him. Sometimes its as simple as going on a date. Other times, no matter what I say or do, he still feels that way. I just try to not get sucked into it. If he isnt being receptive then I typically just stop. That is where I believe self-work and healing comes into play. I dont make him feel guilty; he has guilt. And since I cannot stop the guilt, he has to get healing from it, and I am not the one to do that for him. I had to learn so much about mental illness and health and learn not to take any of it personally. Jordan said that one of the main things that has helped her and Justin is when hes honest with her about where he is, emotionally, and now tells her when hes having a bad day and needs some space. The couple do not live together, which Jordan said is better for both of them right now. Jordan: He would try so hard to make a good day when his head was not in a good place, and it almost always failed. He has so much guilt about his behavior and is always waiting for me to wake up and move on to someone who is normal and can give me what I need all the time. What he doesnt understand is that the good days we have so greatly outweigh any day with anyone else. View this image  Jenny Chang / BuzzFeed Life Jordan: When he is doing what he needs to, I can work with that. When I text him a few times and he responds with something like, I havent slept, I am lost in my mind right now and dont want to say something I dont mean, I know he needs space and can respect that. Are there any moments or experiences that stick out as things you wish youd handled differently? Jordan: Oh god, so many. I put him in a place where my happiness relied on his and that wasnt fair to either of us. I wanted to save him, and if I couldnt it affected me. I thought he could be fixed. It wasnt until my mother, who is a nurse practitioner, said, Bipolar is for life, it doesnt go away, that it really sank in that I was in it for the long haul. Initially I was angry and insecure, because the person I knew wasnt there anymore. He was there sometimes, and I felt tricked. The more I read about mental illness, the easier it got to maintain my zen. I have been fortunate enough to come to a place where my happiness is first and doesnt rely on anyone else. That was hard, and it took 18 months of counseling. What do good days look like for you now? Justin: A good day generally consists of very limited stress. No panic attacks. Not having to worry about money or prescriptions or pain. Jordan and I and the kids have a good time as a family, not having any symptoms of mania. Jordan: He is very needy and affectionate, wants to do everything for me, cook, clean, build me a fire, things he knows I love. He spends a lot of money on the good days. My theory is it is to make up for the bad days. It is difficult for me, sometimes, to go from giving him needed space or fighting to being super clingy and openly affectionate. What do bad days look like? Jordan: He needs/wants different things, depending on his state of mind. That has been influenced by different meds docs have him on, or lack of meds or pain levels that day. A particular instance is when he was on a pill binge and we were supposed to be doing maternity photos for a friend and then going to my younger sisters high school graduation. Something snapped and he started arguing about god knows what and ended up leaving with our friends husband and spending over $500 in crap we didnt need, and then taking my car so I couldnt go to my sisters graduation. Jordan, how do you practice self-care so that you can remain a supportive partner? Jordan: I make music. Justin has been my muse in a lot of ways. I am the lead singer of The High Moons, a four-part, all-female band in Dallas. I write about the things we have been through, and I have been able to reach people in many ways via music. Ive heard people tell me their stories of their loves, parents, friends, etc. who have made them feel similar. If my pain can help one person make sense of theirs, I am doing what I am supposed to be doing. w.soundcloud.com w.soundcloud.com Jordan: I also have a vision board and affirmation cards. I have a great therapist who is all about inward work and no blame. I surround myself with music and people who are good, and that heals me. [You have to] protect your children and loved ones as well as your own heart. The person you love is important, but so is everyone else affected by it. What advice do you have for couples going through something similar? Jordan: [When dealing with the VA], try to get a patient advocate on your side there. Usually they can help weed through the bullshit. Counseling is key, but dont just settle for the first counselor you meet. Both parties need to honor themselves by having time alone, or with others, to breathe. Have a nonjudgmental friend to talk to, one that will just let you vent and not try to fix or save it. And do not feel guilty about cutting people out who make the situation worse. Understand that it is for life. Even if a person gets on a good treatment plan, it isnt a cure. Do you have any advice for people with children, where one of the parents is dealing with mental illness? Jordan: Children are not choosing to be there. So they need to be protected and cared for, first and foremost. Try not to fight around them; be honest with them, but age-appropriate. Protect their hearts and minds and never, ever, ever allow the person with mental illness to drag them into anything. After a bad episode once, my daughter (4 years old at the time) said, Mommy, I wish Justins head wasnt sick, I pray for God to make it better. Balance it all as much as you can and forgive yourself when you cant. What do you love about each other? Jordan: His wit, humor, manliness, beard, ability to probably survive a zombie apocalypse. He lets me be the strong-willed woman I am, he gives of himself and is willing to help anyone he meets, almost to a fault. He is a great dad and a brilliant mind. Justin: I love her because she accepts me. She has been my rock, my general grasp on reality since I got out of the Navy and rejoined reality. She has always been there for me to listen when I need someone to listen, to advise when I need advice, to tell me I am wrong when I think I am correct (Im usually wrong), to call me on my shit and not be afraid to let the cards fall where they may. We have been through the good times and the bad and were still here. Last but not least, she is an amazing mother and partner and I just cannot see myself without her in my life. She makes me a better person. Do you have any fears about the future? Jordan: Not really. Just, yknow, global warming and shitty music.

View this image  Jenny Chang / BuzzFeed Life T has obsessive-compulsive disorder and bulimia. T: From the age of 15, I knew I was different. Being gay in the 1960s, you had to live your life in secret. I put my problems down to the fact I was gay and never [considered that it was due to] mental illness. I have suffered for 50 years with OCD and body image issues (anorexia and bulimia). I hid it from my friends and family and suffered many years without help and support. At the age of 43, I met Khakan. I hid from him my depression and other mental health issues, thinking he would never know. Khakan: I was introduced to T through a mutual friend. When I entered his flat that day, I was impressed by how pristine everything looked. I noted how quick he was to move things back into place. He would even plump up the cushions on the sofa if I left the room. As I got to know T over several months, I would see how he would be cleaning, polishing and buffering surfaces, vacuuming, washing down windows. I would wake up at night and find he wasnt in bed. I thought nothing of it, but he later admitted that he was cleaning the windows at 3 or 5 in the morning. I put it down to having a few restless nights. Around the same time, mutual friends told Khakan that T would make himself throw up after meals. Khakan: I didnt realize how bad it was until one evening, I could hear him in the bathroom and it sounded as if he was vomiting. I went into the room, but he shouted at me to get out. I saw that he was deliberately making himself sick. Family and friends would make jokes about his behaviour and say he was a nutter or laugh and say hes just who he is and let him get on with it. I couldnt figure it out. About two years later, I heard a psychiatrist on the television describing how some people constantly wash their hands, or switch their lights on and off, check the cooker, and repeat rituals or routines. He described it as obsessive-compulsive disorder. I researched it. What I read didnt quite match up with the behavior T was displaying. But it did start a discussion about why he did what he did the cleaning, polishing, etc. I suggested he seek psychiatric help, but he repeatedly refused, saying that he wasnt crazy. I learnt that pushing someone to do something against their personal beliefs or opinion wouldnt help. So I decided that to leave T to do his own thing would work better for us. It was only a matter of time before I knew he would have to seek help. I had to demonstrate patience and understanding. At the same time, I had to express my feelings very clearly. Then, one day, we saw and heard David Beckham on a daytime show talking to a doctor about how he would line up food items in his cupboard and arrange his socks in his drawers, and the doctor diagnosed a mild form of OCD. T said, Thats it! Thats what Ive got! We realized that he also had a form of OCD, but it manifested in a different way. T said he felt better knowing that a celebrity shared his illness, because he then understood that he was not alone. As we talked, it also made me question why he went to the bathroom. He admitted that he was conscious of his body image and had always wanted to be thin. He said he had been sick after every meal for many years. It had started in his mid-teens, when he felt image was everything. I realized he had a severe eating disorder. After much persuasion, he was sent to a doctor who diagnosed bulimia. But the diagnosis didnt put him off. T had learnt to condition his body to reflux after every meal, but control it enough to sustain a relatively healthy-looking body. Things changed when he was about 60. He started to experience suicidal thoughts and took himself to the GP. They diagnosed an underactive thyroid. At the same time, they referred him to a counselor and an eating disorder specialist. The mental health team recognized some of the signs and symptoms that he had with his OCD and eating disorder. They provided invaluable support and encouragement. They discussed issues that he had developed since childhood and in his teen years. Most notably, coming to terms with being gay and wanting to be accepted. After many years and counseling sessions, we learned that T had been brought up in a culture in which being gay was not acceptable. I realized that it was about control. T needed to try and control who he was. Do you have any advice for other couples going through something similar? Khakan: I think in hindsight, the timing to seek professional help could have been better for both of us if he had gone in the earlier stages. But as I said, sometimes you have to learn to manage it as best as you can, especially if they are not willing to recognize they have an illness. Once your partner does accept they need help, grab the opportunity and work with them, support and encourage as best as you can. View this image  Jenny Chang / BuzzFeed Life T: Anyone who suffers mental health problems shouldnt be afraid to tell people. For 50 years, I lived in total secrecy about my health issues. It was totally taboo for someone like me, growing up in the 1960s and over three decades, to own up to such health issues. You suffered in silence. Today, the different agencies where you can receive advice, guidance, and information are endless. Now, after receiving support from professionals, I openly tell people I have mental health issues or illnesses. I still suffer with OCD, bulimia, and body image issues, but telling Khakan (even though he knew and always seemed to know!) has helped me to manage my life better and cope with things I would otherwise ignore or hide. Khakan: I suppose some of the counselling sessions have helped. But I think having patience and understanding, and allowing T to describe his feelings or disclose to people who are close to him what he has, is even better. As a society, we are not encouraged to talk about mental illness, but T speaks about what he goes through to close friends so that people can develop a better understanding. Khakan, how do you practice self-care so you can be a supportive partner? Khakan: Communication, talk time, and being creative helps to alleviate the negativity i.e., baking, cooking, gardening, art, decorating, listening to music, reading a good book, joining or starting a social/support group, or attending a course. We share the living space, but we also take time for ourselves. We have a cat, which helps to relieve any stresses of the day. I think self-preservation as a couple and as an individual helps to maintain good dynamics in a relationship. I try not to allow his OCD or bulimia to affect our being together. We try to be holistic in our approach learn to live and love each other for our flaws, passions, idiosyncrasies, ideas, humor (very important to have in any relationship) behavior, attitude, opinions. The list is endless. What do you love about each other? T: Khakan is strong-minded, determined, and stands up for his convictions, even when it caused problems with his faith and family values. He is liked by everyone who meets him. His devotion to me over the past 24 years, the kindness he shows to others, and the love for me in the good and bad times weve shared. We both have become better people in trying to understand the cruelty that life can throw at you, and still we remain as much in love now as we were all those years ago. Weve never tired of each other! Khakan: We are complete opposites yet we complement each other, like yin and yang. Im much more of a creative dreamer, but he is practical and very down-to-earth. He keeps me grounded. I love his outlook on life, his sensitivities and generosity, his compassion and understanding, his orderliness in our home. We share similar tastes in music and fashion, but slightly different opinions and viewpoints when it comes to people and situations. I think we fit very well together. T: Without him by my side, I would never have survived to be the person I am today. Its been hard for Khakan to cope with my depression and addictions. But he stood by me! Weve been together now 23 years, experienced racial abuse, homophobia, and our families turning their backs on us. We got through it and it made us both better people. Khakan: Maintaining, nurturing, and sustaining a good relationship is hard work. I would say weve worked very hard at our to make it last as long as it has. Twenty-three years in an interracial gay relationship is a very, very, very long time! T: We are still in love 23 years on, and never bored with each other. I cope with my depression and mental health illness knowing Khakan is by my side, my support, my soulmate, my life.

View this image  Jenny Chang / BuzzFeed Life Nancy has bipolar disorder and had postpartum depression. Nancy: I had my first panic attack in 2008, the spring my mother left me again. I felt like I was drowning, but having a heart attack at the same time. Later that day, I wanted to kill myself and kill somebody else, anybody. Daniel talked to me on the phone, reassuring me. But it wasnt enough. I went to the hospital and was diagnosed with anxiety. I got put on antidepressants, the first of many. I married Daniel in November that same year. Something about getting married set me off, and I ended up hospitalized with homicidal thoughts. When I was 11, I was raped by my good friends stepfather. Ive come to learn from therapy that many rape survivors feel anxiety about getting married. Being married made me feel trapped. I told Daniel these thoughts while in bed on Christmas Eve, in 2008. He didnt want to believe me. He tried to reassure me that my thoughts were normal, but I knew they werent normal when I was having to stop myself from going to get a knife so I could stab Daniel and then myself. I made him take me to the ER, where I was then transported to the nearest psychiatric crisis center. Dan: I didnt really know how seriously to take it at first. I had had similar thoughts in the past, and thought maybe she was just obsessing over disturbing thoughts that popped into her head, afraid that they meant she was a bad person. It wasnt until she told me about the voices that I took it more seriously, and decided to take her to the hospital. It wasnt really a shocking or scary experience for me, to be honest. Im self-aware enough to realize that I had a relatively sheltered childhood, especially compared to Nancys. Nancy: I was at the local crisis center. I was terrified. Id never been in a hospital like that before. I couldnt sleep in the bedroom they assigned me due to my anxiety about somebody hurting me, so I slept in the living room. They gave me Geodon, which got rid of the horrible thoughts, but made me a walking zombie. Dan visited me as often as he could. I called him as often as I could, crying all the way. Overall, I was relieved to be on a medicine that stopped the suicidal and homicidal thoughts, even if it did make me beyond sleepy. I was diagnosed as severe depressive with psychotic features. After my complaining, they put me on Abilify instead. Dan: The Abilify worked much better, but then she got pregnant and had to stop taking it. She did fine throughout the pregnancy, but she ended up getting postpartum depression, and hated herself for not feeling connected to our son. She woke me up one night, saying she heard voices telling her to kill me and our son, and she was finding it hard not to listen to them. She ended up in another crisis center for a few days, and her psychiatrist changed her medication. Nancy: It took me three years or so to get the proper diagnosis. Once I did, I was stable until just this year, when I had a relapse when we changed my meds. Dan: I should also mention that she really hates taking the anxiety pills. She is absolutely filled with hatred towards me and herself when she takes them sometimes. In late 2014, Dan changed jobs and took a big pay cut. He says Nancy started to get more stressed at her teaching job and decided to finish out the school year and then quit to focus on writing. She ended up in the hospital again before the school year was over, and almost immediately after the school year ended in summer 2015, she entered another manic phase. What do bad days look like for you? Nancy: My most recent manic episode, I slept with I dont know how many men (hypersexuality can be a sign of mania/bipolar disorder) and I wanted to divorce Daniel and get my own place. I dont like talking about it, because Im so ashamed of it. I was making lifelong decisions in a matter of days. Dan: I didnt realize she was manic at first, and I didnt know how to react, but I knew I couldnt force her to stay with me, so I had to let her go. Fortunately we realized what was going on before she got a job or moved out. Her psychiatrist adjusted her medication, and changed her diagnosis to Bipolar I. Nancy: My psychiatrist upped my Abilify and as soon as that kicked in, I had the worst emotional hangover in the world. All the things I did suddenly hit me and I realized that the path I was on was very self-destructive. My psychiatrist and Dan helped me realize this, but so did the medication. Dan: Shes doing better now, and is trying to focus on writing, but its a struggle because she feels like she isnt contributing to the family. We did just get approved for Social Security Disability Insurance, however, so we are hoping that will help relieve some of the stress. Nancy seeing herself as a burden is one of the most emotionally difficult things for me to deal with. Last spring before she was hospitalized, she had a string of panic attacks and during two of those attacks, she begged me to let her kill herself. She tried to convince me that my life would be easier without her. But I dont see how my life could possibly be any better if she killed herself. Living with the guilt of failing her and the children would be a much greater burden, and I wouldnt have my best friend to help me through it. How do you reassure her when shes seeing herself as a burden? Dan: I remind her that the best thing she can do for all of us is to take care of herself. Me doing all the chores isnt a burden when I know that it frees her up to work on writing or spending some extra time with the kids. Ive never seriously considered leaving Nancy, because I really dont think I would be any happier. I was actually somewhat depressed before I met Nancy, and she helps pull me out of my head and deal with life. View this image  Jenny Chang / BuzzFeed Life Dan, how do you practice self-care so you can be a supportive husband? Dan: Most days I have to choose between getting a full nights rest or having some alone time for an hour or two before going to bed. It also helps that I have a long-term outlook on life, and I just keep telling myself that the kids will be old enough to get themselves ready for school and bed someday. I have a couple of friends I occasionally talk to about some of this stuff, but not very often and not in great detail. My parents are very supportive financially and with helping take care of the kids, but I think they struggle with taking her condition seriously sometimes. If you have friends or family that can help you take care of the kids, then absolutely use them. Dont think youre a bad parent if you need someone else to take care of the kids on a regular basis in order to relieve some stress. What do good days look like now? Nancy: Good days are me working on becoming a published author and actually getting a lot of writing done. Good days are me not having an anxiety attack or feeling worthless. Has her mental illness affected your sex life at all? Nancy: My medicine makes it hard to orgasm and it decreases my sex drive, so it has affected our sex lives in a negative way. And we have two kiddos, so that hurts it, too (lol). Dan: Before her manic episode last summer, we had sex maybe 10 times a year. We havent had sex since her manic episode. It doesnt help that I have become a sort of parental figure in her life, because I spend so much time helping to take care of her. Do you have any advice for other couples going through something like this? Dan: Dont freak out and judge your spouse if they ever start having panic attacks or suicidal/homicidal thoughts. Take them seriously and try to help if you can. If the person cant be consoled, take them to the hospital, or call 911 if you dont think a car ride would be safe. For all mental illness, do not belittle the thoughts and emotions of your spouse. Dont tell them they just need to think positive or get over it. People have said similar things to my wife, which infuriates her and makes her feel like a failure at the same time. Nancy: My advice for couples is that you have to be able to communicate without repercussions. Daniel has never once used anything against me in our arguments. (Well, you know you once wanted to kill me kind of thing.) The partner with the disorder has to realize that it can be managed, but when it cant, when the disorder is bigger than them, they need their spouses support. If you are dealing with thoughts of suicide, you can speak to someone immediately here or by calling the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. You can also get support via text from 3 to 11 p.m. on Samaritans Statewide Helpline, 877-870-HOPE (4673).

aS"Indigenous people who identify as LGBT are more likely to suffer from some form of mental illness. View this image  Shields, a successful actor, dancer and registered nurse has suffered from chronic depression for years. When I was 14, the gay thing was kept a secret in me. I didnt tell anyone. It was absolutely terrifying. I mean it was [the NSW country town of] Walgett 15 or 16 years ago, when homosexuality wasnt even accepted in mainstream culture, imagine being in a small country town in western NSW, he says. Shields says homophobia and racism crippled him emotionally, and he often turned to self-harm. I felt extremely isolated. I used to self-harm a bit, just placing the pain somewhere else. I didnt cut myself. I would, for example, walk along the wall and scrape my hand on the wall or punch the wall to place the pain somewhere else. Shields credits finding a supportive group of friends with helping him to overcome depression, but says he still has dark days. For me living with depression is an exhausting journey that feels like youre in a dark place, and its really exhausting and constant sadness. View this image  When I was coming out and trying to reconcile being gay with my Aboriginal culture I was told by an elder very close to me that being gay didnt exist traditionally. He told me its bad and all these awful things would happen to me, Gregory Phillips tells Buzzfeed News. Phillips is the author of Addictions and Healing in Aboriginal Country and an academic specialising in Indigenous health. He says its dangerous for the mental health of young people to hear that homosexuality has no place in their culture. Homophobia and stigma within our community are the biggest problem and the myth that homosexuality is a white mans thing, well actually, homosexuality is a part of every culture and homosexuality appeared here before colonisation. Homophobic attitudes within the Indigenous community can be largely attributed to Christian missionaries who forbade Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders living under the churchs care, under government orders, from practicing traditional culture. It was from this period that the idea of homosexuality being sinful became a common view within the Indigenous community - one that still prevails today. In 2013, boxer Anthony Mundine created controversy when he expressed disgust about the plot of ABC drama Redfern Now, which featured a homosexual Aboriginal relationship. Watching Redfern Now and they [sic] promoting homosexuality! (Like its ok in our culture) that aint in our culture and our ancestors would have their head for it! Like my dad told me God made Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve, he wrote on Facebook. Mundines comments are completely ill-informed and hes confused about his own identity and religion. Mundine is quoting the bible while he is a Muslim all while presenting as a traditional Aboriginal, so I dont know what hes doing, its rubbish and damaging, Phillips says. View this image  On this particular summer day, after my father had been looking after me (I sat in the corner of the local TAB while he bets on the horses), we arrived back home to discover hed left the house keys inside. He ordered me to climb through the window to open the door, but I refused, Ross wrote in a personal essay for Archer Magazine last year. His response was to verbally abuse me. For the first time in my life I was called a poofter. I didnt know what this word meant, but considering the tone of its delivery, I knew it couldnt be a good thing, When I came out to my father, he told me he used to bash people like me. Whenever we fought, homophobic insults were not off limits. It was Rosss mother who allowed him to be proud of his sexuality. I really think racism and homophobia are just colonial processes, to be honest. They are social diseases and I felt like I had people around me immune to that, Ross tells BuzzFeed News. Ross hopes his writing will inspire other young gay Aboriginal people and believes its essential to raise awareness of the damage homophobia can cause. Like most cultures we [Indigenous people] are able to change and recognise difference, and I believe that gay identity has always been part of Aboriginal culture, Ross says. It defies logic that there were no gay Aboriginal people before 1788. It might not look like what the LGBT community looks like now. The stigma can be devastating and lead to high suicide rates and depression. View this image  They grim reality is suicide, depression, drug and alcohol abuse and risky sexual behaviours are much higher amongst the Indigenous LGBT community experts say. You never really know what the response is going to be from your treating team. There are still old-fashioned views out there and if you couple that with being Indigenous and from the country and gay or transgender you are really on the back foot, Laura tells BuzzFeed News. Laura, who is also gay, says that in some cases people seeking help in the bush are slipping through the cracks. If a client was to disclose that they were transgendered or gay the resources we have in the community are just never going to meet the needs of these clients, Laura says. View this image  I was probably in my late teens and finishing up high school and I was with a really nice girl for a couple of years and I felt something wasnt quite right, Conway tells BuzzFeed News. When I started to realise that I was sexually attracted to guys it really did freak me out and I went through a phase where it was going to be my big dark secret forever. Conway would go on to become a successful rugby league player, but was plagued with worry about the potential backlash he would receive if he came out as gay. Today Conway is a not only a model but also a youth worker advocating for open and honest discussion around mental health issues within the Indigenous community. He says that encouraging young people to be proud of their identity and sexuality is imperative. Working in the youth sector I see a lot of kids, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous trying to come to terms with it and I always say to them, there is always someone to help you if you reach out and there have been people who have walked this path before you, youre not alone.

aS"Id known for a while that I needed to see a therapist. It wasnt until I felt like I could do without help that I finally sought it. Im fiddling with the lid of my latte when a therapist asks, So, Matt, why are you here? The here in question is a room with white walls and lamps that paint them warm. Im sitting on a couch next to my coat, across from the aforementioned therapist, her pad and pen at the ready. I cant look at her steadily yet, so I avert my eyes to the vase of flowers at her desk. I admire how wonderful an arrangement it is, especially as winter creeps in. Thank you, she says. Her voice is calm and even. It helps to change the water. She reminds me of one of my favorite professors from college: patient, kind, someone to whom I divulged plenty as we worked on my future and thesis together. They even share the same bushy hair, a penchant for black turtlenecks, and a name. For now, Ill call this therapist Janet. Janet is my therapist, technically, but its my first visit. I cant say my therapist yet without being too aware of how new this is, how ~New York~ this is, but shes asking a fair question. I place my latte on her coffee table, next to a box of tissues. I faintly register why theyre within arms reach, but I doubt Ill actually use them today. If ever. Especially as Ive managed to go without a therapist for over 20 years now. I tell Janet, Im here for my mental health. She smiles. I remind myself to breathe. Its a canned response, true, but its because I dont know how to be in therapy yet. I have a reason to seek help for my mental well-being, but I havent figured out how it works. Here in this white room, I cant shake the expectation Janet will simply dole out epiphanic advice and Ill be on my merry way. But its talk therapy. And so I talk, which I love to do, even as I rasp with a sore throat. Ive been nursing it since last week. When I saw my doctor, he said it was a viral infection. Nothing I can do except get some rest, work from home, and nuke myself with Advil. Ive seen men three times your size cry with things like these, my doctor said. Youre doing great. Itll pass. Hes a wonderful doctor. I never hesitate to call him, even at the slightest headache. This past summer, however, my symptoms were different: anxiety in the mornings, jealousy in the evenings, and a chronic loneliness that came and went as it pleased. I told myself to not worry about these persistent knots in my chest. Barring a stroke or a heart attack, I didnt plan on asking for help from my doctor. Or from anyone. I self-diagnosed this as just stress. After all, work was hectic, my friendships were wavering, and my mother and stepfather were diagnosed with cancer all within the span of two months. This all presented me with the very real possibility of a life alone, a life full of loss. This is my greatest fear, to live and die alone. But is that not something everyones afraid of? Anyone whos 23 and unsure of their life gets through it. Besides, I was able to get out of bed and head into the office, go to the gym and laugh at my own jokes. Youre just stressed, I told myself. Suck it up. Itll pass. And it did. Only because I did something about it. I spent my 24th birthday on my own and it was wonderful. I shopped. I ate alone. I prayed. That was the reboot I needed, to have a day to myself. As the summer ended, I found myself willingly alone more often. I learned that aloneness was different from loneliness, that I could equate it with being able to put myself first. Spending time alone eases my anxieties and jealousies. While they are no longer tsunamis, still they are tides. My mental uneasiness rises and falls with the phases of the moon, yet they dont quite drown my mind the way they used to. I want to keep this up. So Ive resolved to take better care of myself. I found a dentist, who said I had a slight bout of gingivitis. I went to an optometrist, who said I have dry eyes. And I saw my doctor to get a prescription for Truvada. Its a little blue pill you can take every day to reduce the incidence of HIV infection. He recommended it because Im a gay man in New York. I said yes because Im a gay man in New York who is habitually reckless with his body and his heart. Im lucky to have professionals who help me take care of myself. Gingivitis isnt something you get and think, Hmm, itll pass. Thanks to my dentist, I now floss regularly. My optometrist gave me eye drops and theyre working. And, as my doctor said while he wrote my prescription, anything I can do to prevent the worst case scenario is something worth doing. And hes right. Thats why Im here in therapy. View this image  Charlotte Gomez / BuzzFeed Because while those knots in my heart are now rare, my mental distress might rise up again and break its banks. My friends, family, and career are always subject to dizzying change, so I need to find ways to reinforce my peace of mind. Whether alone or lonely, I should be able to count on my health. As I tell Janet all this, she nods, smiles more. She flips to a fresh page on her pad. Its her fourth. I take my coffee, but I probably dont need the caffeine. I drink anyway. Janet asks, Have you been to therapy before? My first answers no. Then again, I say to Janet, there was that one time when I was 5 years old. I was sent to an analyst, I think, in the face of my mothers crumbling marriage to my father. I dont have a clear memory of this, only stories Ive been told. But apparently, when I was asked about my parents, I said, Mommy and Daddy dont love each other, and thats fine. I laugh at this, despite my sore throat. But its a surprise when my breath hitches and my chest tightens. I reach for my latte, stop, and look at Janet. She nods and I exhale. We begin to talk about my work. Its been crazy at the office lately and Ive had to fight back tears at my desk now and then. My job description has come to revolve around change and, historically, change that is out of my control scares me. Changes at work, at home, in my dating life, it all means losing everything Ive worked so hard for, forcing me to start over again. Change makes me anxious and frustrated and, I dont know, angry. Janet tilts her head, says, You dont seem like an angry person to me. I hold my breath, sigh, and admit shes right. Ive never described myself as angry before. Scared is more like it, I tell her. Theres a silence between us as I acknowledge my fears, as I check the water levels in my mental banks. I nod and she smiles. Our conversation turns to my love life. I tell her about my anxiety with waiting for boys to text back. Janet asks about my last serious relationship. I talk about my ex, how I wanted to forge ahead with our relationship, but I perpetually had to wait for him to catch up. A few grand times he waited for me, on me, held me like we were running out of time. Then, it seemed, we had too much time. He said he wasnt ready. Janet asks me if I loved him. I say yes, embarrassed. Have I considered, she asks again, that though he wasnt ready, it was possible he loved me too. Instead of my coffee, I take a tissue from the box. My eyes stay dry, though the softness in my hand is reassuring. As are the brief silences between me and Janet. She nods for me, with me, and the things I talk about loss and/of love, fear and/of change, being ready for them all in some small way, become things I can breathe in and breathe out. I never sought therapy, prior to today, because I didnt think it was an option. Im from a medical family, so Ive always been more comfortable with pills and hospitals than warm quiet rooms. Money was also a convenient excuse. But when I learned therapy was accessible among my friend group of broke-ish twentysomethings, I cast myself as the martyr. Other people need the in-network appointment slots more than you, I told myself. Other people have it worse than you. Suck it up. Itll pass. View this image  Charlotte Gomez / BuzzFeed And it does pass. But no matter how long the lulls, I stand at the shores of my mind and fear the storms on the horizon, as the dreadful tides that come in and out threaten to take me under. I need someone to keep an eye on me, to call me out on my bullshit, on the excuses I give myself and the ones I give others. Its a task Ive always reserved for myself, but already I juggle multiple jobs at work, let alone in my personal life. My friends were once my lifeboat, but it was this pressure and strain on the people I love that tested our friendships. After all, they have their own lives and their own therapists to see. Id see them after their own therapy sessions, huge epiphanies in their wake, and demand of myself the same thing: to achieve clarity, to earn peace of mind, to loosen the knots in my heart on my own. Then I asked for help. And here I am, in therapy, wondering when and how enlightenment will come. Janet says gently, Were out of time. We schedule a session for next week. And with my insurance, Im financially comfortable (and terribly grateful) making it a weekly engagement, a luxury I wont let myself forget. As I put on my coat, Janet and I make small talk though I doubt any talk in this room will be too small. Youre very honest, says Janet. I pause, my arm half in a sleeve. It sounds like communication is something you deeply value. I nod, she nods, we smile. This, I expect, will become routine, par for the course, something I will come to count on. This first therapy session was like a first date, except my date genuinely does want to know me better. My openness, we agree, will come in handy as we sail on my lifeboat together. Janet reminds me that, here in this warm room, I call the shots. This time is mine, she says, my therapy. My therapy, I repeat, playing with the words in my mouth. They dont come with an epiphany, nirvana, or everlasting peace of mind. It may come in a year or 15, be it with Janet or other therapists, but I at last see that mental health will always be a constant work-in-progress. Because now, for me, therapy is not about getting better, but rather tackling what I experience every day. Whats more, through therapy, things I can handle just adequately on my own, I can handle better with help. Its a recalibration of my mind, self-maintenance of my heart. Its changing the water in a vase of flowers, nipping the buds that refuse to bloom, trimming whats gone to wilt, even as winter creeps in. And its just nice justly nice and nicely just to feel like self-care is a healthy indulgence. Thank you, I say, and Janet, my therapist, responds, Be well. I leave with a lighter heart. The next day, I feel my throat getting better. I can talk and not hurt. I check in with my doctor over the phone and were both glad Im on the upswing. Keep it up, he says. Healing takes time.

aS"Senate Bill 2, passed by the legislature in May, lets magistrates refuse to perform marriages on religious grounds. Three couples, in a lawsuit filed Wednesday, argue the law should be found to be unconstitutional. View this image  Carol McCrory, left, and Brenda Clark, center, speak to Buncombe County Register of Deeds Drew Reisinger, right, after applying for a marriage license at the Buncombe County Register of Deeds office in Asheville, N.C. AP / Adam Jennings Citing their religious objections, at least 32 court magistrates have recused themselves from performing marriages under a North Carolina law that was designed to let officials shun same-sex couples, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday. Lawyers representing three couples argue that the law is unconstitutional and must be nixed. Filed in the same federal court that struck down North Carolinas ban on same-sex couples marrying in 2014, the suit argues the states magistrate-recusal law violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments by promoting a religious viewpoint at taxpayer expense and lets public officials violate their oath to uphold the Constitution. They are embracing judges who believe as a matter of religious faith that gay people are second-class citizens, Luke Largess a lawyer at the firm Tin, Fulton, Walker, & Owen, which is handling the case pro bono told BuzzFeed News. LGBT rights groups Equality North Carolina and Campaign for Southern Equality are backing the lawsuit. Passed in May as Senate Bill 2, the law allows court magistrates who claim any sincerely held religious objection to opt-out of performing marriages. If they do so, they cannot perform any marriage for six months, same-sex or opposite-sex, and the state must find another official to perform the marriages in their absence. The measure was one of numerous bills introduced by legislatures around the country to promote religious freedom at the same time legal rights for same-sex couples rapidly advanced. In practice, the North Carolina statute has allowed all four of the court magistrates in McDowell County to recuse themselves. County Register of Deeds Tonia Hampton told BuzzFeed News in September that while marriage licenses were still being issued, magistrates from other counties had been shipped in to perform the marriages. According to the law, the state must pay to shuffle court officials from county to county as needed. Lawyers contend the law allows officials to violate a sworn oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution noting that a federal court in North Carolina and the Supreme Court have found same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry. Furthermore, the suit contends, the law harms third parties because it compromises, impairs, and violates the constitutional integrity of the judicial system to the detriment of the citizens of North Carolina by protecting the employment of magistrates unwilling to recognize and protect the constitutional rights of a segment of the public: gay and lesbian citizens of McDowell County and every other county in the state. Finally, plaintiffs allege, the law denies due process and equal protection rights because magistrates who area also required to adjudicate legal matters unrelated to marriage hear cases involving gays and lesbians. In those cases, they say in the complaint, gays and lesbians must endure judgement from a magistrate who believes they are not full citizens as a matter of state sanctioned religious belief. The plaintiffs include two same-sex couples and one mixed-race couple. They argue magistrates could also opt-out from marrying other mixed-race couples, a violation of established case law. They are asking the court to declare the law unconstitutional, find that magistrates cannot disavow their obligation to perform their duties, and block the state from spending money to implement the law. I think a lot of people who are not avid supporters of gay rights agree that once the law is the law, judges are obligated to uphold the law, said Largess, adding, Everyone in the state knows that the purpose of this law was to rebuke the courts for approving same sex marriage. Lawmakers repeatedly said they supported the legislation broadly as a matter of religious freedom. However, in 2014, Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger indicated in media reports that it was motivated by objections to same-sex couples marrying. Lawmakers approved the law by overriding a veto by Gov. Pat McCrory, who warned at the time that no public official who voluntarily swears to support and defend the Constitution and to discharge all duties of their office should be exempt from upholding that oath.

aS"Theyre dressed as a woman, but its a mans drivers license. View this image  Whitney Curtis for the ACLU Meagan Taylor and her best friend, who are both transgender women, were traveling through Iowa on July 13 to a funeral for her best friends brother when they stopped at Drury Inn & Suites in West Des Moines. As the pair attempted to check in, both the clerk and the manager gave us looks of disgust when they were not avoiding eye contact, Taylor wrote in a complaint she filed against the hotel with the Iowa Civil Rights Commission in November. The complaint says a hotel clerk asked Taylor for her ID, which identified her by her male birth name, and then photocopied the ID even though the clerk had already seen it earlier. After getting their room key, We tried to put the looks of disgust and poor treatment out of our mind. But Taylor, 23, could not not forget what happened next an experience that entailed being arrested and then jailed for several days. Hotel staff called 911 to tell police about somebody that is a little unusual that is checking into the hotel, according to a recording recently obtained through a records request by the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU, which is representing Taylor in her complaint, shared the recording with BuzzFeed News. In the 911 call, a woman who identifies herself as the general manager says she was concerned because Taylor is dressed as a woman, but its a mans drivers license. She also wanted police to make sure theyre not hookers either. w.soundcloud.com 911 Dispatcher: Communications, this is Holly. Hotel manager: Yeah, hi, Holly, this is Kim, the general manager over at Drury Inn & Suites. And I have somebody that is a little unusual that is checking into the hotel, and I didnt know if there was any way to possibly run their name or information through the database. Theyre dressed as a woman, but its a mans drivers license. Dispatcher: OK, I can send an officer, but I cant do it over the phone. Whats your address there? Hotel manager: Its 5505 Mills Civic Parkway. Id want it to be discreet though. Dispatcher: OK, well, um, I cant do it on the phone, thats the only thing. Its against the law. So I can have someone come over. Where are they in the lobby there, or? Hotel manager: They went up to the room and stuff. So I guess if they just kind of discreetly park in the parking lot, instead of, you know, right out front, that would be great. Dispatcher: Well, Ill leave that up to them. But, whats your number phone number, Kim? Hotel manager: Its (515) 457-9500. Dispatcher: OK, so thats a female, with a males drivers license. Hotel manager: Theres two males, but theyre dressed as females. And they have Illinois drivers license. Dispatcher: And are they what are their drivers licenses? Male or female? Hotel manager: Male. And I took pictures with my camera, so. Dispatcher: OK, so just because theyre dressed as is it because theyre dressed as females, is that why youre concerned? Hotel manager: Um, Its just, you know, its, I guess so. Theyre dressed a little bit over the top, too. I just want to make sure theyre not hookers either. Dispatcher: OK, gotcha. Okay, maam, well have them swing over there. Hotel manager: Perfect. Thank you. Dispatcher: Bye bye. Hotel manager: Bye bye. BuzzFeed News left messages with Drury Inn & Suites to ask about Taylors allegations that she was harassed based on her gender identity, but did not receive a response. An ACLU lawyer representing Taylor in the complaint, Chase Strangio, told BuzzFeed News the hotel has not filed a response to the allegations filed with the civil rights commission. Police arrived at the hotel room the next day, according to Taylors complaint, and officers found hormones she takes as part of a medical treatment for gender dysphoria. She was arrested for not having a prescription, then jailed for a few days in solitary confinement. Taylor was never charged with prostitution, the complaint said. The Transgender Law Center reported that Taylor had an outstanding warrant for an unpaid fine in Illinois. She was charged for possessing a drug without a prescription, but all of the charges were dismissed. Strangio noted on the ACLUs blog that transgender women of color face high rates of discrimination and profiling as sex workers. It is this type of profiling that leads 47 percent of Black transgender women to be incarcerated at some point in their lives, Strangio wrote. This ordeal was humiliating, scary, and traumatizing, Taylor concluded in her complaint. I felt powerless and degraded. I realized I was not welcome in a public place simply because of who I am. Through no fault of my own, I was targeted, harassed, arrested, and forced to miss a funeral simply because I chose to stay at a hotel where I was unwelcome. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"My employer is hurting me and other gay people by celebrating someone who considers me no better than a paedophile. View this image  BBC NI reporter Andy West YouTube / BBC A BBC Northern Ireland reporter has been threatened with suspension and is facing disciplinary procedures after criticising the BBCs decision to keep Tyson Fury on the shortlist for BBC Sports Personality of the Year, BuzzFeed News can reveal. Andy West, a news presenter, wrote on his Facebook page that he was ashamed to work for the BBC and accused the broadcaster of hurting me and other gay people by celebrating someone who considers me no better than a paedophile, following controversial remarks made by the boxer. The status update has since been taken down but a BBC source told BuzzFeed News that as a result of the comments West was reprimanded by a manager, told an investigation would be launched into his conduct and warned he could be suspended. Fury sparked widespread condemnation following an interview with the Mail on Sunday in which he said: There are only three things that need to be accomplished before the devil comes home: One of them is homosexuality being legal in countries, one of them is abortion and the other ones paedophilia. Who would have thought in the 50s and 60s that those first two would be legalised? An online petition was launched in the wake of the interview and further controversial remarks made by the IBF world heavyweight champion calling on the BBC to remove him from the BBC Sports Personality of the Year shortlist. It has so far attracted more then 115,000 signatures. West also signed the petition in conjunction with his Facebook status, the full text of which, passed to BuzzFeed News in screenshots, reads: My employer is hurting me and other gay people by celebrating someone who considers me no better than a paedophile and who believes homosexual people are helping to bring about the end of the world. View this image  Facebook / Andy West It is tempting to see him for the laughable idiot he is but sadly there are many other idiots who will be inspired and encouraged by his naive, juvenile bigotry. I am ashamed to work for the BBC when it lacks the bravery to admit it is making a mistake. In a further comment underneath the status, West, who previously enjoyed a distinguished career as a producer on BBC Radio 2, added: I criticise the BBC for offering him as an idol to be celebrated and admired not just for his sporting achievements but also his personality. A friend of Wests told BuzzFeed News: Andy loves the BBC but is so sad to see it giving a pedestal to someone who seems to be causing injury to people like him, who want to live their lives as the people they are. He just wants to stand up for gay people, particularly in Northern Ireland but also elsewhere who are still facing prejudice. The friend added: Andy doesnt think Tyson Fury should be stopped from having his own beliefs. He just thinks the BBC is wrong to be condoning the nomination of someone like Fury who people, especially children, are supposed to look up to. Its so horrible for him to be caught between a job he loves and his principles. He doesnt want to lose his career. He just has to be honest about what he believes. In an email sent from West to Tony Hall, the BBC director general, that has also been leaked to BuzzFeed News, West wrote: I appeal to you as an equal opportunities employer and proud bastion of fair-thinking to consider whether it is appropriate to celebrate someone who has stated that gay people are sign of a coming Armageddon and equates homosexuals to paedophiles. The email continues: Can it be that my own employer is happy to suggest that this individual is an example for us to follow? When asked to comment by BuzzFeed News, a BBC spokesperson said: We do not routinely comment on individual staff matters.  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The laws of Jamaica that criminalize consensual sexual intimacy between men essentially render me an un-apprehended criminal, said the man who brought the new case. View this image  facebook.com A new challenge to Jamaicas law criminalizing homosexuality was filed with the countrys Supreme Court on November 27, more than a year after a man challenging the law withdrew his case citing threats against himself and his family. The new suit is being brought by Maurice Tomlinson, a gay Jamaican attorney who received death threats after a local newspaper published a photograph of his marriage to his Canadian partner in 2011. The countrys attorney general, who is named as the plaintiff, was served with notice of the suit on Tuesday. It will be formally announced at a press conference to be held in Kingston on Thursday, according to a media advisory published on the website of AIDS-Free World, an international NGO that is supporting the challenge in cooperation with the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network. The laws of Jamaica that criminalize consensual sexual intimacy between men essentially render me an un-apprehended criminal, Tomlinson states in the court filings, which were shared with BuzzFeed News by a source familiar with the litigation. Criminalizing homosexuality amounts to a direct and blatant denial of equality before the law for [Tomlinson] and other gay men in Jamaica. Tomlinson was the lawyer for the claimant in the challenge to the provision known colloquially as the buggery law put into place when the island was under British colonial rule that was withdrawn last year. Hes brought other suits related to gay rights, including an unsuccessful suit against a Jamaican television station that refused to air an anti-homophobia PSA because it could be construed as promoting illegal activity. Tomlinson now splits his time between the home he shares with his husband in Toronto and Jamaica, he said in an interview with BuzzFeed News, though he says he follows a security protocol and restricts his activities when he is in the country because he is still receiving death threats. He agreed to be the claimant in this new suit after difficulty recruiting someone to replace Javed Jaghai, the man who withdrew his challenge to the buggery law last year because of safety concerns. Ive certainly reached a point where I cant imagine things getting much worse than they already are in terms of security concerns, Tomlinson said. The good thing is that I have the option to not be where the danger is, since he has a home in Canada. Tomlinsons suit seeks to have the buggery law nullified in all cases of adult consensual sex, which is currently punishable by up to 10 years in prison and hard labor, as well as requiring those convicted to register as sex offenders. No one has been convicted under the buggery code since 2005, Tomlinson said, but it has served as a blackmailers charter allowing police to use the threat of arrest of gay men for extortion. Tomlinsons court filings also argue that the law encourages the high rates of anti-LGBT violence, including several mob attacks over the past five years. His affidavit in the case includes reference to a 2011 report of a group that invaded the home of a 16-year-old named Gordon Oshane, which chopped his foot off as he attempted to escape through a window before killing him. Tomlinsons filings also say that the buggery law leads police to turn a blind eye towards these attacks, even turning on the victims when they seek protection. I have found that some police officers themselves are often responsible for attacks against gay men and other [men who have sex with men] and/or are unwilling to take seriously the investigation of attacks and threats when these are reported to them, Tomlinson states in his court filing. Victims have good reason not to trust the police. Tomlinson said the court has scheduled the first procedural hearing of the case for February 23.

aS'Dadvance Australia Fair. View this image  A daddy, of course, is an older gentleman who is attractive to the younger generation thanks to an air of sophistication, power, wealth and general handsomeness. They have a certain je ne sais quoi. As BuzzFeed News discovered in October, the youth of Australia found a new daddy when Malcolm Turnbull knocked off Tony Abbott to become prime minister, and subsequently king of the daddies. But Malcolm is not alone. From Turnbull to Trudeau and Baird to Bandt, these are the daddies who dadded the hardest in 2015. View this image  Hastie, 33, entered parliament this year and has been pretty quiet since then, but qualifies as a political daddy thanks to the simple act of being an actual father. The former SAS soldier looks great in a suit and word around the Canberra press gallery is that some flacks have dubbed him Tasty Hastie - which he hates but we wont stop calling him that either. Were expecting big things from this daddy in 2016. View this image  The first of two international entrants on the list, Trudeau makes the cut because his daddyish qualities cross international borders. He may have only been the Canadian prime minister for a few weeks, but he has already captured the the worlds heart, mostly because hes a fine slice of Canadian bacon. This is truly the first time I\'ve ever imagined a Canadian PM fingering me. Thank you, Canada. #DaddyTrudeau choke me daddy!!1!1!1!1!_  View this image  The smouldering senator rose to prominence in May this year when he unexpectedly took over the Greens leadership. If you find political pragmatism sexy and dont mind a man who once rocked an earring, Dr Di Natalie is the daddy for you. I want to get Richard Di Natale in bed. #Daddy Di Natale is daddy View this image  Adam Bandt literally became a daddy this year when he gave birth to a beautiful new beard. (Oh, and his wife also had an actual human baby). And the punters, they just loved it. Having some Adam Bandt beard feels tbqh god damn. Adam Bandt\'s beard. Feeling conflicted that Adam Bandt looks hot with a beard, but also that he now kinda resembles the not-hot dad character on Family Ties. Facebook won\'t let me change my relationship status to "It\'s complicated with Adam Bandt\'s Beard" View this image  Our second international entrant. Theres no other way to say it, the Democratic candidate for U.S. President is hot AF. He could burst onto our scene any day. He probably wont make it to the White House but hell always be president of our hearts.

Whether it was live-tweeting the Bachelor finale or turning up to work in a Delorean, the NSW premier couldnt put a foot wrong in 2015. View this image  So... It seems I am my own daddy. This is simultaneously logical and disturbing. @BuzzFeedOz @MarkDiStef View this image  The former attorney general has been flying under the daddy radar for some time now, but made a last-minute bolt for the Top Daddy title with his late-year dissection of special minister of state, Mal Brough. Theres never been any doubt that Dreyfus is a handsome older gentleman, but it wasnt until he expertly cross-examined Brough at the despatch box that his daddy qualities really came to the fore. He was firm, assertive and completely in control, all great daddy qualities. @anniedundun Mark Daddy Dreyfus. WHY DID NO ONE TELL ME MARK DREYFUS IS EVEN MORE HANDSOME IN PERSON!? D: Is it just me or is Mark Dreyfus a bit ruggedly handsome? #bishop View this image  Shortly after Turnbull became Australias prime minister in September this year, a strange but entirely understandable phenomenon began: young people started calling him daddy. Turnbull is a daddy because hes a silver fox with good teeth whod take care of you, one Tweeter explained in this BuzzFeed News investigation. Hes got an iPad and an apple watch so clearly hes got money to spare and could buy you things (when I say you I mean me I want him to buy me things). My friends and I always say he would totally have coffee or a beer on the gentrified Melbourne streets so hes a relatable daddy. View this image  View this image  A dad is what Bill Shorten is - desperately trying to maintain his authority and project competence whilst flailing wildly, probably with a bit of scrambled egg on his tie. Sorry Bill :( EDITOR\'S NOTE: BuzzFeed News notes the absence of some well-known political daddies on this list. These daddies include, but are not limited to, Jason Clare, Cory Bernardi and Scott Ludlum. While these men are still daddies in their own way, its the considered belief of BuzzFeed News that these men did not daddy hard enough in 2015 to make the list in their own right.

aS"The Arcus Foundation and several other groups said Tuesday they will lead a five-year funding initiative to boost the transgender movement in the U.S. and poorer and developing nations. View this image  Jurek Wajdowicz Two foundations pledged Tuesday to contribute $20 million over five years to organizations in the transgender movement, officials told BuzzFeed News, an unparalleled philanthropic donation to improve quality of life for transgender people around the world. The dispersement could be a transformational windfall for groups with causes recently enjoying increased visibility and growing backlash but have historically had meager financial resources. Beginning in 2016, the money will be awarded mostly to U.S. groups that focus on transgender issues or are led by transgender individuals, rather than organizations that include transgender issues as part of a broader agenda. The project will expand internationally in following years, particularly in poorer and developing nations. Among the goals: quelling a rising tide of violence against transgender people, increasing job opportunities, and boosting long-term inclusion of transgender people in society. The Arcus Foundation, which gives to social justice and human rights causes, will contribute $15 million. The NoVo Foundation, which focuses on girls and women, will give $1 million. A coalition of other foundations will give the remaining $4 million. The trans movement is overdue for this kind of engagement, Jason McGill, Arcuss vice president of social justice programs, told BuzzFeed News in making the announcement. Transgender leaders and their movement have been dramatically underfunded. We anticipate that other funders will join us, McGill added. The money will substantially increase overall funding for transgender-focused organizations. A February report by Funders for LGBTQ Issues examined grants from U.S. foundations for domestic and global transgender and intersex issues. It found transgender groups received $13.6 million in the three-year-span of 2011 to 2013, which was 7% of funds awarded to LGBT issues in general. McGill said the funds will be awarded with guidance of transgender leaders and activists, who will help identify programs and organizations that can advance long-term agenda for trans rights. The projects ambitions include increasing understanding of transgender people, expanding pathways to economic sufficiency for a chronically underemployed population, and promoting long-term philanthropy of the transgender movement. Despite the skyrocketing prominence of transgender people, many services and policy protections lag. Trans people are far likelier to live in poverty, be unemployed or homeless, and discriminated against in the workplace or housing than their cisgender the term for people who are non-transgender counterparts. In politics and crime, transgender people have increasingly been used as scapegoats by conservatives who oppose LGBT nondiscrimination laws critics routinely claim such laws allow men in womens bathrooms to act as sexual predators while homicides of transgender women in the U.S. doubled over the past 12 months. Globally, 1,700 transgender murders have been reported in the past seven years, according to Arcus data. Were deeply committed to ending violence against girls and women everywhere, and this is an urgent opportunity to deepen our longstanding work and advance our mission, Pamela Shifman, NoVo Foundations executive director, said in a statement. Violence against trans women is an epidemic, and we want to partner with others across philanthropy to help address it. Arcus has long played a key role in funding the transgender movement while also funding a wide range of LGBT causes with over $10 million in grants for trans-focused over the past 15 years. In the first three quarters of this year, Arcus granted more than $1.7 million dollars to transgender-specific issues. The newly announced money will be in addition to those figures. Roz Lee, director of Arcuss social justice initiatives, said that baseline level of funding will continue independently from the new contributions. She said much of the new money will go to groups with budgets of $100,000 or less, while increasing the capacity of larger groups to support their long-term sustainability. Support from foundations like Arcus, which started long before anyone was discussing Caitlyn Jenner or a trans tipping point, has been critical to building a strong and resourced movement that could survive to see the moment of unprecedented visibility and unprecedented violence we face today, said Transgender Law Center executive director Kris Hayashi told BuzzFeed News. Hayashi added that the funds ensure that Transgender Law Center and other leading organizations can continue our work for justice so all people can live safely and fully as their authentic selves. The funders will begin accepting applications for proposals by mid-2016, Lee said, and start dispersing money by the end of that year. We can increase the visibility of work that has been going on for decades but has been underfunded, said Lee. We are trying to take the long view. You need to combine policy change with cultural change if there is going to be any shift in lived experience. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Conversion therapy is all but dead in Australia but what will it take to kill it? View this image  Chung Sung-jun / Getty Images Please take this from me, I dont want to be gay. Brisbane man Johann De Joodt knows first hand the horrors of gay conversion therapy. A participant in numerous programs designed to purge his homosexuality during his twenties and thirties, De Joodt adopted a traumatising routine of church, sin and repentance that looped on repeat every week for 15 years. Sunday, I was going up to the altar, crying out to God, he said. Monday, I would sin by having sex with another man, and then beat myself up to a pulp so by Saturday I was suicidal. Id manage to get myself to church on Sunday and then do it again, every week. That was basically my life. The question of whether conversion therapy works was answered long ago: it doesnt. Leading psychological associations in Australia and around the world have denounced therapy that attempts to change sexual orientation. Earlier this year, a report from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called for nations to ban the practice, describing it as unethical, unscientific and ineffective and, and may be tantamount to torture. Partly as a result of these strident denouncements, the prevalence of such therapy has significantly declined in Australia. Around 40 providers across the country in 2000 have dwindled to just a handful still in action today. Theres very little left. Its in disarray, says former pastor Anthony Venn-Brown. Venn-Brown, who has himself been through reparative therapy, is the most prominent voice on conversion therapy in Australia. He now works as the founder and CEO of Ambassadors and Bridge Builders International (ABBI), a group that works to combat ignorance and hostility between the LGBT community and churches. View this image  Anthony Venn-Brown. Hadden Motion Pictures Speaking to BuzzFeed News at a cafe in Waterloo, Sydney, Venn-Brown suggests another part of the decline is due to a growing acceptance of gay people in wider society which, of course, includes churches too. More people are out, churchgoers have got gay sisters, brothers, colleagues, friends, Venn-Brown says. When a church leader says being gay is an abomination, people say, youre talking about my uncle who I love very much. The most thriving ex-gay programs are in Queensland, where Liberty Incorporated runs alongside the smaller Triumphant Ministries Toowoomba. Sydney-based Living Waters, one of Australias longest-running ex-gay programs, closed down last year. There are also groups that advertise themselves as providing pastoral counselling on dealing with same-sex attraction, but clarify they do not attempt to change sexual orientation. These groups include Liberty Christian Ministries in NSW, and Renew Ministries in Victoria. However, perhaps due to the stigma now attached to conversion therapy, there is little public information available about the funding, treatment methods and numbers of clients for each of these organisations. While Venn-Brown estimates that the programs would get very few referrals these days, their relative invisibility serves as a shield to such information. Well never know the exact numbers, he says. At the heart of religious conversion therapy is a strong belief in an all powerful God, says Venn-Brown. Programs use a number of methods to exploit this belief, convincing participants that homosexuality is not what God wants for them. Venn-Brown went through dramatic exorcisms, where he convulsed on the floor for hours as pastors gathered around him, screaming for the demon of homosexuality to exit his soul. Other methods include group and personal counselling, where homosexuality is posed either as a shameful habit that can be broken or an affliction, harking back to the days when it was considered a mental illness. View this image  Brendan Hoffman / Getty Images Johann De Joodt bristles at the description of gay conversion therapy as nearly dead. Conversion therapy hasnt ended in Australia, he says. It is alive and well. De Joodt came to Australia from Sri Lanka in 1984. A few years later, he found himself heavily involved in the Assemblies of God Pentecostal church movement now known as Australian Christian Churches and struggling with his sexuality. I went to confess my sin of homosexuality to my pastors, he says. I was pretty involved in church life, and the pastor recognised that there were a few other people in the church who were struggling with their sexuality as well. De Joodt started the Living Waters ex-gay program in 1990. This was the first of many programs he went through, and when his weekly routine of church, sin, and self-loathing began. It wouldnt end until 2005. For years, De Joodt prayed the gay away as various pastors attempted to cast the demons of homosexuality from his soul. He was told his sexuality was a habit that could be broken and changed, that he was gay because he had been sexually assaulted as a child and lacked a decent father figure. He enrolled in courses on self-esteem, and learning how to say no, and did hours of counselling. He prayed, week after week after week. Unsurprisingly, Johann stayed gay. But the years he spent in therapy ate away at him in other ways. My health Johann starts, then pauses. I am on antidepressants. Everything Ive been through has stuffed up my mental health. Since 2000, twelve peer-reviewed, primary research studies have found conversion therapy is harmful to mental health. A Columbia Law School project collating conversion therapy research found that among people who had undergone the treatment, there was a prevalence of depression, anxiety, social isolation, decreased capacity for intimacy, and suicidal thoughts and behaviours. There is powerful evidence that trying to change a persons sexual orientation can be extremely harmful, the researchers concluded. People have taken their lives, they are now on pensions because they cant function in everyday life, says Venn-Brown. There are PTSD issues, theyve been harmed mentally, theyre traumatised. This manifest trauma and pain is why Venn-Brown has devoted his life to combating ignorance between the LGBT and faith community through ABBI. His daily grind is a softly-softly approach that coaxes people of faith and the LGBT community closer together. The biggest challenge is fear, he says without hesitation. In the past and in conversion therapy being gay and being a Christian were seen as incompatible. Venn-Brown says that when he was going through therapy in the 1970s and 80s, there was nobody who believed there was such a thing as a gay Christian. You were either Christian and heterosexual or you were gay and going to go to hell, he explains. The gay Christian movement was just beginning to grow then. After coming out in 1991, he left the Christian faith for six years but then returned to it after realising being a gay Christian was possible. There are things [in Christianity] that I can take, that are very real for me, he says. Forgiveness, sowing and reaping, having purpose. As attitudes have changed and churches become more permissive, many LGBT Christians have been able to reconcile their faith with their sexuality and gender identity. However, a damaging rift still exists between the two communities, with years of betrayal from religious organisations leaving LGBT people fearful and unwilling to engage. Those hurt most by the hostility are LGBT Christians, who are often left feeling as though they belong in neither camp. Just as Christians have stereotyped all LGBT people, some LGBT people have stereotyped all Christians, says Venn-Brown. We get called perverts, abominations, they get called bigots and haters. And that doesnt get us anywhere, just sitting back in our camps, our tribes, throwing barbs at each other. Its obvious the division is unhelpful but is being called a pervert really on par with being called a bigot? Venn-Brown pauses before answering, in short, no. Its about the perception we will often hear, a Christian like [Australian Christian Lobby Managing Director] Lyle Shelton or [Christian Democrats leader] Fred Nile say I am not homophobic. But everything that comes out of their mouth is completely homophobic. They just dont understand what homophobia is, because theyve never experienced it, he says. We come from our own hurt, and our own pain. And we react, as any human would, when cruel and nasty and insensitive things are said by these people. He switches into the second person, speaking directly to those who have hurt him. You dont know what that does to us, because youve never experienced that. You dont know what it feels like. But matters of blame and hostility aside, Venn-Brown is convinced his approach of dialogue and respect is best. He knows both the LGBT and the faith community intimately, and says church communities do not respond to aggressive activism. I introduced [Hillsong Pastor] Brian Houston to a guy in his church who had been referred to somebody [for conversion therapy], says Venn-Brown. I got him and his parents to write a letter, Brian met with him. Later, it emerged that Houston had issued a directive to all Hillsong staff to never refer anyone to these programs. Ive talked with people who are major religious leaders in Australia. Its been a journey of ten years for some of them, Venn-Brown says. Ive seen progress, but not where I would want it to be. In every human rights movement, its taken decades to shift. If youre not in it for the long haul, its not going to work. ABBI has also pushed for the outlawing of conversion therapy in Australia. Although Venn-Brown describes the movement these days as irrelevant and inconsequential, he says a legislative approach would send a decisive message to individuals, to churches and to society that conversion therapy is a relic of the past. However, politicians involved in LGBT law reform say a legal approach to ending conversion therapy is complex. Theres not much that can be done to target these organisations specifically at a federal level, other than continuing to tighten anti-discrimination legislation and look at the applicability of consumer law, Greens senator Robert Simms tells BuzzFeed News. If providing the therapy was considered a breach of the Sex Discrimination Act, its likely that the religious exemptions in the Sex Discrimination Act would protect conversion therapy providers. Under Australian consumer law, the religious and not-for-profit aspects of most conversion therapy programs would mean they are not considered commercial in nature. While such laws could be tweaked, says Simms, its unlikely they could be used as a mechanism to eradicate the therapy altogether. Graham Perrett, a co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of LGBTI People Working Group, says a federal law banning conversion therapy may be unconstitutional. In terms of section 51 on the powers of the parliament, I cant see any head of power that would give the federal parliament any capacity to make gay conversion therapy illegal in Australia, he says. There are some legal avenues under state and territory law as well, with acts in all jurisdictions outlawing advertising of health services that are deceptive or misleading. It could also be possible to lodge a complaint with the Australian Psychological Society that their code of ethics has been breached. However, there is no black and white policy solution to immediately ending conversion therapy. Its all just prejudice welded onto quackery packaged by a religious organisation, says Perrett. I think education is the best antidote. View this image  Sebastien Bozon / AFP / Getty Images De Joodts conversion journey reached a fork in 2005. His conversion counsellor at the time, CEO of Liberty Incorporated Paul Wegner, told him I can help you suppress your sexual desires, but I cant help you change your sexual orientation. I was like, Well, whats the point? says De Joodt. If you take a ball and try to push it in a bucket of water and let go, its going to eventually pop up. He came out, lost a lot of people, and left his Pentecostal church. He went to the LGBT-friendly Metropolitan Community Church for a few years, and then stopped that, too. But God is still in his life. I have days where I feel like a Christian, and there are other days where I feel like I hate God, he says. I think Ive resolved my sexuality with my faith. If people want to be so small-minded as to think that you have to be straight to get into heaven then I think theyre going to get a big shock when they do get to heaven. A pause, and then: I think God is bigger than the box you put God into. Its because of this new understanding of faith, says De Joodt, that he doesnt relapse into wanting to be straight again. Ive come to a point where I believe I need to be honest before myself, and before my God. Theres a famous saying, isnt there? He thinks aloud. Change what you can change and leave the rest to God? Or something like that. Accept the things you cant change? A quick Google search later, it becomes apparent De Joodt was trying to recall the words of the Serenity Prayer, brought into popular culture by its widespread use in Alcoholics Anonymous meetings: God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change / The courage to change the things I can / And the wisdom to know the difference. It took years of anguish, but finally, De Joodt has been granted that serenity. He knows the difference, too. If God wanted just another heterosexual, God could have created one, but instead God created me fabulous, he says. My sexual orientation is something I cannot change.  A spokesperson for Liberty Christian Ministries declined a request to be interviewed for this piece. Requests sent to Liberty Incorporated and Triumphant Ministries Toowoomba were not responded to.

aS"The model/actress is selling a The Future Is Female shirt that bears a striking resemblance to one designed by another brand. View this image  View this image  View on Instagram Instagram Instagram After several hours they took it down, because said Rachel Berks of Otherwild, The comments felt extremely violent and it was very upsetting to me. View on Instagram I wanted to share my thoughts and this image which shows #Otherwilds sweatshirt on the left, and @caradelevingnes identical version on the right. The slogan The Future Is Female originates from Jane Luries and Marizel Rios Labyris Books (1972), and Otherwild used @lizacowans image of Alix Dobkin in the shirt (1975) with permission, as originally seen on Kelly Rakowskis @h_e_r_s_t_o_r_y. Otherwilds redesign and reissue of the FIF tees and buttons is protected under copyright law, which mandates that any reproduction of an existing known public work must be altered at least 20% from the original. If model/actress Cara Delevingne wanted to sell my line, she would need to wholesale them from Otherwild, and because we donate 25% of our lines proceeds to Planned Parenthood, Delevingnes ethical practice would benefit not only our woman-owned small business but would also serve as a significant donation to PP. Delevingne could also choose not to wholesale from Otherwild and create her own design of the slogan on clothing to sell. But Delevingnes choice to lift and manufacture Otherwilds design, claiming it as her own to sell with an undisclosed charitable offering, is indefensible. Her actions ironically counter the very message of the slogan The Future Is Female, and its confounding that she would do this to a small queer feminist-owned business after purchasing the product from us just a few weeks ago. Although under pressure, Delevingne has changed the lines attribution several times in the past 24 hrs., she has not yet offered to wholesale from us nor cease and desist blatantly copying and selling our designs. View on Instagram The photo and tee were designed by artist Liza Cowan. View this image  Otherwild might have a case but only if they protected their design via trademark registration AND the design has what the law refers to as secondary meaning or what we brand enthusiasts call brand equity, Rob Wallace told BuzzFeed Life. View on Instagram However, if there is little relevant equity or association of the design back to Otherwild as the source of that design, then the design may be what the law refers to as generic, he said. My guess? Since the design pre-existed since the 1970s and the design is fairly commonplace (All cap helvetica type, my guess) there is probably little equity that links the design back to Otherwild, Wallace said.

aS"HIV infections are decreasing nationwide, but new CDC numbers show an 87% rise in diagnoses among young black gay and bisexual men over the last decade. The growing racial divide has turned HIV from an infection into an injustice, a health official said. New numbers released by the CDC on Sunday show that while HIV diagnoses have fallen roughly 19% nationwide from 2005 to 2014, infection rates among black and Latino gay and bisexual men continue to rise steeply. While HIV diagnoses among white gay and bisexual men have seen a drop of about 18% over the last decade, among gay and bisexual Latinos, that rate has increased by about 24%. Black men who have sex with men have seen a rise of about 22%, but the starkest numbers were among those aged 13 to 24 who have seen an 87% rise in new HIV diagnoses in the last decade. Black women, however, have seen the sharpest decline in new infections, which have been cut nearly in half. HIVs widening racial gap is a deeply disturbing finding, Jonathan Mermin, director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, told BuzzFeed News. In recent years, the rise in HIV rates among black and Latino gay and bisexual men has leveled off, Mermin said, due in part to an increase in HIV prevention efforts targeting communities of color. But the fact that the gap is still growing is a pressing public health issue. Health disparities have turned HIV from an infection into an injustice, he said. View this image  Centers for Disease Control As epidemiologist Greg Millett noted in the Advocate, the high rates may also have to do with the fact that the high concentration of HIV among black gay men increases the likelihood of encountering a partner who is HIV-positive even though studies have shown that black gay couples are less likely to have sex without a condom than white ones. Other social factors such as access to healthcare and lingering stigma around homosexuality also play a well-documented role. For example, young black and Latino men are far less likely to be taking the pill that prevents HIV transmission also known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP than other groups. Partially as a result of this, both populations are disproportionately affected by HIV: In 2010, the most recent year for which numbers were available, black Americans made up 44% of all new HIV infections, while Latinos made up 21%. The statistics are hard to ignore and even harder to fathom, Millet wrote. Because of the deep social causes of health disparities, the battle to tackle the HIV epidemic among black Americans is also increasingly being linked to the Black Lives Matter movement. View this image  Empire actor Jussie Smollett and sister Jurnee Smollett-Bell talk about HIV in the black community on World AIDS Day. screenshot from NBC BLK All states must take responsibility for protecting communities that are at risk, Mermin said. But some states, especially in the South, are years behind. In 2012, the most recent year for which numbers are available, nearly 14,000 individuals with AIDS died in the U.S. We have to accelerate access to testing, treatment, and prevention to work against the disparities that are so prevalent with this infection, Mermin said.

aS"Anal isnt everything. View this image  Topos Graphics for BuzzFeed News What is sex, exactly? If youre a freshman taking your high school health class, sex is a flower having its petals torn off. According to philosopher Michel Foucault, sexuality is a discourse, bound up in our societal attitudes and laws regulating the human body. And when I was a teenager staying up late to browse the family computer while everyone was asleep, the internets definition of sex at least when it came to man-on-man action was two drunk straight guys who had never done anything like this before. For me, sex was something shameful, marked by a lifetime of disappointment. When I was 23, I told the guy I liked to stop the first time we had sex. It was really painful and it didnt feel right. The next day, he told me he didnt want to see me anymore. A week later I had sex with someone else just to prove that I could. Before I took my clothes off in his bedroom, which was filled with stacked PBR cans and old laundry, I repeated to myself, I am a person who likes sex, I am a person who likes sex. I thought if I said it enough times, it would be true. Instead, I accidentally took a shit all over him. Gay sex is supposed to be transcendently exhausting, so orgasmic that it makes you instantly grab for a pack of cigarettes. In my experience, bottoming is like having a hot knife jammed into my intestines and I avoided it for the next three years, until I met a man I wanted to like sex for. He was kind and patient, and I tried very, very hard. I relaxed and tried not to be so tense and I made plans to have sex with him every day until it felt normal or like the sex I imagined other people were having until we slowly had less sex and then stopped. I was tired of gritting my teeth through the constant pain, and I could tell he took it personally, as if hed done something to hurt me. I should have realized a lot earlier that the problem was bigger than me, but youd be surprised how used you get to certain things: like sleeping alone to avoid taking a dump in a strangers bed. When it came to sex, I thought pain was the only choice I had. Whats more, I thought I deserved the pain but I wanted to deserve someone who loved me instead. This past March, I decided it was time to stop hurting. A jovial internist in Brooklyn advised me to get a colonoscopy to take a closer look, and he came back with news: I had irritable bowel syndrome. It might seem like theres little connection between food and intercourse, but when youre having gay sex, the two are intimately and sometimes awkwardly connected. As Zach Stafford wrote in the Huffington Post, its common knowledge that if you are a bottom and plan on having sex, then you shouldnt eat at Chipotle. If anal sex can be messy, IBS only makes it worse, causing bloating and pain in your lower abdomen if you eat trigger foods (mine are dairy, eggs, spicy foods, and the dreaded gluten). For some, irritable bowel syndrome is linked to constant, uncomfortable constipation, but others may experience unpredictable bouts of diarrhea. If youre already feeling bloated, having anal sex might be the absolute last thing you want to do because it only makes you feel worse. I was referred to a specialist who told me what to eat but also how to prepare it. But even for those who manage their symptoms with diet control, many gay men who suffer from IBS continue to be reticent about having anal sex. On sexual health forums, men complain that the nagging fear of pain in the back of your mind kills the experience. I suffer from lots of bowel problems, which [makes] the idea of being on bottom even less appealing, a forum poster on RealJock confesses. Even more of a problem is even on days when my IBS isnt an issue, I just cant enjoy it. Another user on the IBS Group website claims that after getting diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome, he stopped having sex altogether, because hes too worried about a flareup. These men may choose to go the rest of their lives without having anal intercourse but those with IBS are certainly not alone in finding penetration painful, or otherwise undesirable. According to a 2011 study from George Mason and the University of Indiana, researchers found that just 1 in 3 men who have sex with men (MSMs) are regularly having penetrative intercourse. An earlier study from the Centers for Disease Control in 2005 found that number to be somewhere between 55 and 80% (theres sadly little research overall on the subject). No matter the specific statistics, a significant number of gay and bisexual men arent regularly having anal sex. But that doesnt mean theyre being celibate theyre engaging in mutual masturbation, foreplay, oral sex, and all kinds of sexual behaviors too often deemed as lesser. In 1998, Bill Clinton claimed that he did not have sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky because she only gave him a blowjob, after all and it seems that the idea itself has stuck. A 2007 survey from the University of Kentucky found that just 1 in 5 college students classify oral sex as sex. But the kinds of sex that gay men and queer people in general are having force us to rethink those notions, ones that for too long many, including myself, have accepted as the only definition of what counts in bed. Sex is a symbol, a language, and a physical encounter but its also a range of experiences as diverse as our bodies themselves, which we too often ignore. And as a number of researchers, therapists, and writers have testified, its time to start recognizing them. Where do we get this idea of what counts? For many gay men, it starts with our own sex partners and friend groups. I spoke to Noah Michelson, the executive editor for the Voices section of the Huffington Post, who told me that this is a problem he regularly encounters. Over the phone, he explained that were he to tell a friend that hed had sex with someone but that it didnt involve penetration, he would likely hear something like: Thats not sex, thats a hookup. Michelson said, They have all these other names for it. Gay men often fall into the same limiting notions of sexual intercourse as the undergrads in the Kentucky study what sex therapist Ian Kerner calls sex script rigidity. That term entails a number of different things: For a couple who have been together for 40 years, rigidity might mean that one partner is stuck always performing the top position, even if he might like to switch things up. But as Noah Michelson explained, these expectations often frame sexual interactions between gay men from their earliest connections. If youre messaging a guy on a hookup app, the first question often is: Are you a top or a bottom? The question is an indication that when it comes to this encounter the end goal is penetration. And for Michelson, that can feel invalidating. He confessed that he would fall into that category of people who would say that Im not having a ton of penetrative anal sex as a gay man. When I asked him why that is, he explained: I think it can be a lot of work, especially as a bottom. There are things that you need to do to get ready for anal sex and it just ends up being like, Ugh, do I really want to go through that whole routine to do that? I think that anal sex can be amazing, obviously, but other things can be just as amazing. Joe Kort, a 52-year-old writer and sex therapist, explained that its not just that he rarely engages in penetrative sex. In our phone interview, he told me that hes never had anal intercourse despite being in a decades-long committed relationship. Whereas many men label themselves as tops or bottoms, Kort calls himself a side. In an article for the Huffington Post, he defines sides as men who prefer to kiss, hug and engage in oral sex, rimming, mutual masturbation and rubbing up and down on each other, to name just a few of the sexual activities they enjoy. Kort continues, These men enjoy practically every sexual practice aside from anal penetration of any kind. They may have tried it, and even performed it for some time, before they became aware that for them, it was simply not erotic and wasnt getting any more so. As Zach Stafford now a contributing writer for the Guardian clarified in an interview, the problem is oftentimes not anal sex in and of itself: The problem is the shame our culture makes people feel around their preferences. When it comes to anal sex, Stafford explained that theres a pervasive stigma around the act of bottoming. He argued that this shame is partially a result of the 1980s AIDS epidemic but instead of encouraging people to lead healthier lives, the stigma only creates more blame. Its about making you the reason why something bad is happening, Stafford said, but what we know from science and from our lives is that stigma doesnt save the world. One way to eradicate the shame of bottoming, or any other kind of sexual preference, is education. In the United States, theres very little in the way of sex ed for anyone let alone for queer individuals. That means that many MSMs are forced to educate themselves with the limited resources they have, which often involve the unrealistic depictions found in gay porn. As Kort explains, visual depictions of gay sex take a lot of the messiness out of it. Kort said, They made sex look so easy and anal sex look so seamless. Michelson agrees: No one makes any weird noises, there arent any weird smells, its not awkward. Thats not what sex is about. I think it does a great disservice to people in general but especially to young people who have expectations of what sex is going to be like. While pornography can be a way to normalize alternative sexual practices like BDSM or fetish play its a bad substitute for healthy, empowering instruction that allows you to explore your sexuality or gives you a space to do so. Thats exactly what Paul Rosenberg hopes to provide. He founded Seattles local Rain City Jacks in 2005, a male masturbation club that meets three times a month. In our chat, he told me that his goal is to give people a new way of experiencing sexuality in a very positive way, and he believes that the public nature of masturbation clubs is a way to encourage that. Its all in the open, Rosenberg said. It invites a sense that this is OK. No matter what kind of sex were having, Rosenberg explains, its important to be honest and open about intimacy. If you want to create a world thats shameless around sex, you have to model that for others, he told me. Rosenberg is right but that also entails being more honest with ourselves. As a 27-year-old adult, getting diagnosed with IBS was like a second coming out of learning to be more honest with myself and my partners about what I want. According to Kort, thats incredibly common. He explained that defining your sexual preferences what you do and dont like, or what youre willing to do is an important stage of the long coming-out process. I think coming out gay is a different experience than coming out sexual, Kort said. When you come out gay, youre having gay sex and doing stuff, but youre really coming out with your identity. It has less to do with sex and more to do with who you really are. If it takes a long time to come to terms with your sexual nature, that comes with a certain amount of trial and error as well as being open to the process of learning about your body and what it likes. Working across the spectrum of LGBTQ individuals, I find that the definition of sex is usually pretty elastic, Kerner said. I am continually inspired around the flexibility of what defines sex. Kerner explained that he would never encourage someone to do something they dont want to do, but it can also be important to push a little outside of [your] comfort zone. For me, that entailed trying things I hadnt done before, experimenting with different toys to help myself relax. My partner and I are working up to penetrative sex while realizing that, hey, maybe we wont get there, and thats OK. Were also experimenting with anal massage, based on Ian Kerners recommendation, and we might even make a visit to New York Jacks. And earlier this year, I got a happy ending massage on a recommendation from a friend, which helped reframe my notions about what sex was: Instead of needing to have penetration, it became about having an experience. You should be engaging in intimate acts that give you pleasure not having the kind of sex you think youre supposed to be having. This is why sex and relationships coach Mark Davian insists that its important to shift away from goal-oriented sex. Instead of looking specifically for intercourse, Davian believes the idea should be that were going to feel good but were not so focused on a goal. That can open up doors. Im still opening those doors for myself by figuring out what I like and what sex means to me. In doing so, Ive discovered that theres no definition of normal whether thats in bed, or anywhere else.

aS"Sometimes its the simple things that help the most. View this image  The uncomfortable feelings that come with gender dysphoria can really throw a wrench in your day-to-day life, making even simple tasks seem impossible. This type of dysphoria is often defined as a condition where a person experiences discomfort or distress because the gender to which they were assigned at birth and their gender identity dont match up. When your body and mind arent seeing eye-to-eye, its easy to feel pretty low. We asked people to tell us what they do to make themselves feel good when theyre stuck in some serious dysphoria blues. Heres what they said: When my dysphoria gets bad, I take out my guitar and play music. Sometimes I like to play my own music, music I wrote. Mostly I just cover songs. When I play, I feel like Im in my own world, just my mind, my hands and my guitar. I escape into a little space inside my head and fill it with music.  Anonymous I am nonbinary, but I was assigned male at birth. Whenever I experience dysphoria, I usually turn on some music and just let my mind clear. Ive also found that it helps to tell myself, out loud, that my body does not define my gender and to point out things about my body that I do like. Just because I have big hands, doesnt mean Im male. And I know I love my eyes. I have to remind myself that there are still positive things about my body. Something else that works for me is talking to one of my good friends. They know that sometimes I feel awkward in my body, and they can help reassure me that Im 100% awesome even though my body doesnt exactly match how I feel that day.  Anonymous Im nonbinary. Some ways Ive found to help cope with dysphoria [include] wearing an outfit I know I look good in (it boosts my confidence a lot) and listening to songs I can sing along to. I also like repetitive tasks, like putting CDs or books into alphabetical order or making bracelets. It gets me out of my head, helps me focus on other things. Quite often it gets overwhelming, though, in which case sometimes just having a bit of a cry and a sleep helps. Oh, and cuddle a pet. Pets dont care what gender you are. Ive never in my life known a transphobic dog.  Anonymous View this image  Ive had gender dysphoria long before I knew I was nonbinary but i just didnt know how to describe it. Some days I can control it; other times its impossible to control. it makes me hate myself, but its not very strong most the time. To make myself feel better I wear comfy clothes, do my makeup and make myself feel like the person I am inside. Also chocolate is a great quick fix ;)  M. My best way to cope with dysphoria is quiet indie music or watching YouTubers like Uppercasechase, a trans guy who is pretty far in his transition. Seeing trans people who are far into their transition gives me hope that everything will be okay. Watching YouTubers who are transgender and talking about it helps to know Im not alone and gets rid of the feeling that Im the only one feeling like this. It really is a great feeling knowing youre not the only one.  Arthur As a trans guy at about 8 months on T, it really helps me to look back at older photos from when I wasnt so far along on my journey and look at how far Ive come. Old photos are super cringy to look at but they definitely make me feel better about where Im at now.  Jamie View this image  About a year ago, I would probably not have known what dysphoria even was. Well, now I do, and Ive come to experience it from time to time. It can lead to self harm and anxiety, so its not really fun. Usually I get through my bad days by trying to talk slower and quieter, as that usually makes my voice sound a little deeper. I usually let my mind drift off to my favorite playlist,s or maybe try to talk to friends of mine who might have the same problem.  Nate The struggle is absolute hell, especially in mine and many other cases of being in high school, a tough series of years on its own figuring out your true gender or how to embrace your choice in gender can be really hard. Most of all, avoiding bullying [can be hard]. But what I like to do is surround myself with friends who are typically dealing with similar struggles with sexuality or their gender as well. If things continue to get worse, I highly recommend a warm blanket, a desk to hide under, some sweet movies, books, or rad tunes. Also candy and shizzle come in handy.  Anonymous Im a trans woman but I didnt have major issues with body dysphoria either before or after transition. I think a big part of the reason for that is because I trained for a long time in modern dance, which focuses so much on what your body can do rather than what it looks like. So I knew that I wanted to be a woman, but I didnt carry with me a lot of the body image baggage that goes with. I enjoy being a powerful, athletic woman whose body doesnt conform to idealized beauty standards. Anyway, I know that very few peoples bodies do.  Meredith Talusan Im a trans guy, pre everything, and my name is Emmett. Im generally very dysphoric, but some days are worse than others. On my bad days, which is usually when Ive been misgendered a lot or when Im menstruating, I tell my best friend and she calls me lad or sir and makes comments about how masculine I am. I also bind every day, and sometimes I pack with a sock pinned to my boxers. I tend to make tea, talk in a deeper voice, and wear all mens clothes when Im feeling dysphoric too. One of the best things I do for myself is take breaks and make sure I keep myself safe.  Emmett View this image  I write. I have to stop the hollering in my head so I put it all down on paper. Then it isnt as real, they stop being consuming emotions and theyre just words. Kaleb As a gender-nonconforming person, my body image fluctuates on a regular basis. Sometimes I feel femme and sometimes I feel butch. There are times when I feel a little trapped, like on social occasions when Im expected to be femme when I dont feel like it, like for weddings or formal interviews. On those occasions, I usually try to wear at least one item of clothing that I feel like doesnt conform to standard binary gender norms, like a necklace I identify with masculinity, or boxers under my dress. It makes me feel like Im still genderqueer even if there are times when I dont feel comfortable being seen that way.  Anonymous Im genderqueer and experience a lot of dysphoria around my monthly cycle [] but I like to get as cold as I impossibly can (open a window, take off all my clothes) and get into a really hot shower or bath and wash away the cold. I also live in my hoodie when Im feeling nasty and it feels good to be toasty and wrapped up.   Karen View this image  Whenever Im feeling dysphoric, it can be hard to do simple things like shower so what I do is, before taking any clothes off, I turn on the water really hot so that all the mirrors in the bathroom and fogged up and I can shower and get dressed without seeing my reflection.  Aleksander On days when Im feeling particularly dysphoric I tend to look at pictures that show the diversity of cis peoples bodies so I can recognize that although to me some parts of my body feel out of place, to a bystander I wouldnt stick out at all. I think anyone that experiences dysphoria needs to realize that our perception of ourselves is quite often very skewed.  Evander Ribton-Turner If you are dealing with dysphoria right now.. 1. Take a deep breath.  Relax, allow yourself to think straight. 2. Have hope. One day this will be all over. We feel depression because we see no future, but I promise there is one. 3. Express how you feel.  If you need to draw, write, play sports: Do it! Find something that you like, and express your full emotions while doing so. 4. Talk  Talk about how you feel, whether its to a friend or even to yourself! ( No, youre not crazy. ) Talk: You need to say how you feel, and what you feel, and make goals for yourself. 5. Understand what youre feeling.  Listen to yourself and understand exactly what youre feeling. We all as humans have goals and have places in our lives we would like to be. Dont feel alone. 6. Remember you are important.  Your trials and struggles in life are here to make you stronger. Youve made it to this point. Youve done it be proud of yourself. Love yourself. You are bold, you are beautiful, and you are important.  Travis When I get bogged down with gender dysphoria I tend to hide in my room under blankets and hope it goes away. Or, I will wear baggy jeans and sweatshirts to hide my shape which admittedly isnt the smartest idea when one lives in California. But in all reality you need to be kind to yourself during this time. You are still you, you are valid. Just because your body doesnt look like what you or society expects it to, it is still beautiful, and it is still yours.  Anonymous View this image  Ive been overweight most of my life, but especially after puberty. Its been hard, because society is not kind to people who dont fit into their beauty standards. I often struggle with feeling good enough, attractive enough, and just enough, on top of this dysphoria. This year, I started taking care of myself. Investing in me is investing in my work! Ive found that good nutrition and exercise has helped tremendously. My mood is better, I feel healthier, and its something I never really believed I could do, but now I know I can.  Rhys If youve been feeling really dysphoric for a while, spend a day dressed as your stereotypical biological sex. Youll feel awful for the day, but the day after when you dress as your actual gender will be awesome. Avoid transphobic places and people as much as possible (certain friends, YouTube comments in general) and go to places that understand and affirm how you feel (Tumblr, safe spaces). If theres a certain activity that makes you feel less dysphoric (shaving, using hair gel), do it!  Anonymous I have experienced gender dysphoria for years, and it is far from fun. But there are many ways I make myself feel better! Sometimes, I put on that one outfit that I know looks flawless. I write down a list of all of the things that I love about myself. Maybe I watch that new episode I have been meaning to see! I always do something that I love doing: This small distraction can take away from the pain of gender dysphoria. The most important thing? Know that you are allowed to feel this pain, and that you are beautiful and amazing.  Anonymous Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .

aS"Exclusive: Canon Jeremy Pemberton was the first British clergyman to marry another man. What happened next sparked a landmark legal battle. He tells BuzzFeed News how the fight for equality became a fight for his sanity, career, and reputation. View this image  Lynzy Billing / BuzzFeed There is a hand-stitched cushion cover that sits, unfinished, in Jeremy Pembertons house. He began sewing the design when he could not get out of bed, when he had sunk so far into despair that focusing on each tiny stitch was the only way to stay sane. The story of how he sank, off work and resisting thoughts of suicide, reaches far beyond the walls of the home he shares with the man he loves. It is the story of what happens when you take on the Church of England. And it is one that Pemberton has never revealed in full until now. The case of Canon Jeremy Pemberton, daubed across newspapers and television channels, has been reported so widely that many already know what happened to the first British clergyman to marry someone of the same sex: that he was stripped of his powers as a priest, unable to conduct official duties, and then barred from a job as an NHS hospital chaplain. As a result, he took the Church of England to an employment tribunal on a charge of discrimination. But what has gone untold is the inner story behind the landmark case, and, remarkably, the household name that was backing him. The stakes were higher than many suggested: If Pemberton won, the precedent set could begin to unravel the Church of Englands exemptions from same-sex marriage and equality laws. It could also block the church from dictating who the NHS is able to hire. In the battle between religious and LGBT rights, it would be a crucial fight. View this image  The cushion cover cross-stitched by Pemberton while unwell. Jeremy Pemberton BuzzFeed News begins contacting Pemberton, 59, in April, two months before the tribunal begins. He says at the time his legal team are feeling very positive. And then, in November, 12 days after the judgment comes in, a text message arrives at 3:47am confirming that he will come to BuzzFeed News London office for an interview. Eight hours later, Pemberton sits gazing out the window, explaining why he texted at such an ungodly hour. Im not sleeping, he says, trying to sound upbeat. I sleep for about three hours and then wake up thinking about it all. With so much riding on the case, what has that responsibility been like? I feel it quite acutely, he says softly. There is no precedent. This is the test case. The way the Church of England has developed the exemptions is just wrong and to use them like this to effectively punish me for getting married went against all natural justice. The Equality Act 2010 ensures everyone has the same access to employment, as well as private and public services. The Church of England, however, along with certain other religious groups, enjoys a loophole: It can bar LGBT people from jobs if theyre sexually active or, in some cases, in civil partnerships. Similarly, the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 exempts the church from performing same-sex ceremonies and canon law, which defines marriage in heterosexual terms, is protected. Both sets of exemptions came following lobbying by Anglicans. Some have said Pemberton should have known what would have happened when he married Laurence Cunnington at a register office in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, on 12 April 2014 two weeks after same-sex weddings became possible. But no one ever told me, says Pemberton. Guidance from the House of Bishops only materialised a few weeks before, several months after Pemberton had begun planning the wedding. It would not be appropriate conduct for someone in holy orders to enter into a same-sex marriage, given the need for clergy to model the Churchs teaching in their lives, said the guidance. The precise repercussions for anyone disobeying were not explained. View this image  Lynzy Billing / BuzzFeed The bishops hadnt thought, Maybe some people will be planning weddings and maybe its not very fair to people to expect them to cancel, says Pemberton. Nevertheless, prior to the wedding, Pemberton contacted Christopher Lowson, the bishop of Lincoln, where Pemberton worked as a senior hospital chaplain, to discuss his intentions. He assured me he would not be starting a disciplinary action against me, says Pemberton. Instead, after the wedding, Lowson sent Pemberton a written rebuke and advised him that this black mark would stay on his file forever. It arrived during the couples honeymoon. On Pembertons return, Richard Inwood, the then acting bishop of Southwell and Nottingham where Pemberton lives asked to see him. Inwood had been in his role for just three days before Pembertons wedding. At the meeting, says Pemberton, the bishop told him he should not have married, because doing so contravened the doctrine of the Church of England. At the end he said, Ill let you know what I decide, Pemberton says, so the canon pressed Inwood for the likely outcomes. The possibilities were: that Inwood would do nothing, or he would present Pemberton with a rebuke, similar to Lowsons, or he would remove Pembertons permission to officiate (PTO). The PTO is the piece of paper priests need to be able to do most of their job. Three days later, Inwood chose the last option. It meant, says Pemberton, that in the area he lives, I cant take services, I cant preach or take Holy Communion or marry, bury, or baptise. I can play no ritual part in the life of a church. Under normal circumstances, he says, a PTO is removed for egregious wrongdoing such as breaking the law if, for example, a priest is accused of sexual abuse. The letter also demanded that Pemberton return the PTO document to Inwoods office as soon as possible. After more than 30 years of service to the church, what was that like? Awful, he says, his baritone voice cutting out. Absolutely terrible. It felt so degrading. As if I couldnt be trusted. Pemberton had been a rising star in the Church of England. After graduating from Oxford he trained to be a priest and was ordained while still in his mid-twenties exceptionally young. By 2005, after serving in several posts and devoting years to working in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Pemberton was made an honorary canon. This title is bestowed upon the best the most dutiful, long-serving priests. His then bishop advised Pemberton to consider a future as a dean, archdeacon, or bishop. Ten years later, after becoming a canon of Ely as well as Boga in the Congo, that future was stubbed out. He had disobeyed. View this image  Lynzy Billing / BuzzFeed But as Pemberton talks, his imposing 6 2 stature supporting a sweetly authoritative voice, it is compassion and fortitude albeit dented that cloak him, not victimhood or embitterment. Given what has happened this seems remarkable that is, until BuzzFeed News takes him back to his wedding day. What was it like standing opposite his fianc, exchanging vows? Suddenly, Pemberton cannot speak. His eyes fill. Well he begins, only to stop again, breathing into the depths to control himself, it was just me and him and He looks skywards not at anything visible or ethereal, but as if at the highest of human experiences. I realised that I was doing absolutely the right thing for somebody I love. He pauses and smiles. I knew it was going to cause trouble. The problem was he could not be sure what kind or even from where that trouble would come. The Mail on Sunday had already turned up at his house the day before the wedding. The journalist, he says, paced up and down outside all afternoon before knocking at their door. Fearful that if they refused to cooperate the reporter would show up at the ceremony, Pemberton and Cunnington agreed to speak to him and have a picture taken, on the understanding there would be no unwanted guests the next day. View this image  Jeremy Pemberton and Laurence Cunnington pose in their wedding attire The Mail on Sunday / Associated Press Pemberton characterises the interview as stilted, which certainly comes through in the resulting story the reporter asks Pemberton how he expects to feel after marrying, and receives the reply: We will feel married. Press intrusion was merely one concern, however. Because each bishop can decide how to punish transgressors in their own diocese, the situation now facing Pemberton was almost comically absurd. With one bishop wrapping him on the knuckles and another ripping off his dog collar, every morning he would wake up in Southwell not a priest, and then drive into Lincolnshire for his hospital chaplain job, where, suddenly, across the county border, he was a fully functional priest again. Thus, adds Pemberton, Not only is my case about discrimination, but the inconsistency of the whole process. The compounding problem for Pemberton was that during the meeting with Inwood, he advised the acting bishop that he was applying for a new position a promotion to senior hospital chaplain this time in Southwell. [Inwood] said, It would be difficult to give you a licence if Id removed your PTO. And so, on 3 July, four weeks after Pemberton was offered the promotion, he received another letter from Inwood, this time informing him that he would not be granted the necessary licence to take up the position. I was furious, says Pemberton. View this image  Lynzy Billing / BuzzFeed Pembertons new husband, meanwhile, was incandescent with rage. Cunnington, 52, detailed on his Facebook page what had happened and implored friends to write to the acting bishop and his archbishop, John Sentamu, to protest against the decisions. A tidal wave of post started heading towards them, says Pemberton, adding that Sentamu got his act together and arranged a pro forma letter to go out to everybody. Inwood, he says, replied to no one. With media coverage of the unfolding scandal intensifying and with his job offer looking imperilled not to mention the removal of his PTO Pemberton sought out lawyers to help him, despite having no funds to pay them. He approached an ecclesiastical barrister, Justin Gau and two further barristers, Sean Jones QC, an employment specialist, and Helen Trotter, an equalities expert all of whom offered their services for free. The case, after all, could make legal history. They said it would be something they would be prepared to do pro bono but would I go home and check my household contents insurance? he says. So we went home and discovered we had 100,000-worth of legal cover. Ive not told anyone this, but thank you, Direct Line! He laughs joyously: One of Britains most recognisable insurance companies, whose logo comprises an old red telephone on wheels, came to fund one of the countrys key equality lawsuits. The little telephones came good! says Pemberton, before pointing out that even this cover wouldnt have been sufficient without his legal team working at extremely reduced rates for him. The Church of England hired Herbert Smith Freehills, a top international law firm not the churchs usual choice in legal matters. And it wasnt the kind of case the firm is known for: Herbert Smith Freehills liberally sponsors LGBT charity events. Pemberton estimates that the churchs legal fees will, by now, be several hundred thousand pounds. (When asked by BuzzFeed News to respond to this claim, the Diocese of Southwell and Nottingham declined to comment.) Its obscene, says Pemberton. I feel sick we have a government determined to dismantle the welfare state, this is going to mean the voluntary sector is going to have to step in. Thats where the money should be going. He stops for a moment and looks down. View this image  Lynzy Billing / BuzzFeed Its really sad to see an institution that does a lot of good but the good it does is overwhelmed by this incredible obsession [homosexuality], which gives it such dreadful negative publicity. I get people telling me, Im not taking my kids to a place where they teach people to be homophobic. He pauses again. When I think about the message of Jesus, he was not one for sticking to the rules, he was for finding people others thought werent worth bothering with. Well, theres a clue in there, guys. The tribunal itself was still months away. And before any legal preparation could begin, the NHS trust responsible for Kings Mill Hospital in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, withdrew the job offer because Inwood had refused the licence. Pemberton received the news while travelling to France for a break. He returned early. A few days later he was due to go back to work. I said to Laurence, I cant. I was very depressed. He went to his doctor. I got some antidepressants. Some days he begins before jolting himself. Some days I would just get up and get dressed and go downstairs. That would be it. That was all I could manage. Id be in bed sleeping a lot. Was there a point where he did not know how to get through it where he considered ending everything? Yes, says Pemberton. There was. He had already had a breakdown eight years earlier. But during this period, of late summer and autumn of 2014, Pemberton found something that helped: cross-stitching. That was my therapy, he says. It was something I could hold on to and concentrate on. A cushion cover. Its my wellness cushion, it helped me get better. There was something else that helped. Laurence, he says. He was wonderful, endlessly patient and supportive. When Pemberton hid in bed or in the house all day, Laurence would say, Do you want to go down to the shop? They met on a website for gay fathers in 2008. Both had been married for several decades to women Pemberton with five grownup children. At 50, the priest finally stopped denying who he was. You carry on pretending until you cant, he says. I came out to myself first in the mirror. I looked at myself and said, Im a gay man. The shame he had lived with for half a century drained, never to return, he says. For me, it was a profoundly spiritual moment. Lynzy Billing / BuzzFeed Lynzy Billing / BuzzFeed Messages between Pemberton and Cunnington on the site led to daily phone calls and, finally, their first meeting. You know that thing about going weak at the knees? he says. I went weak at the knees. Pemberton returned to work in the hospital chaplaincy position in Lincolnshire and began to brace himself for the tribunal. In June 2015, before the proceedings started, he says, one of his barristers offered some advice: Dont believe everything you see on telly. Theres no drama. The barrister was wrong. The tribunal was packed full, says Pemberton, with suits from London: a registrar of the London diocese, a top London solicitor who was there apparently to take notes for the Archbishop of Canterbury, a legal secretary from the General Synod, also there to take notes, and a representative from the legal division of the pensions board, as well as all the barristers and solicitors from both sides. Pemberton was cross-examined for seven hours. I dont think anybody realised quite how aggressive their silk [Tom Linden QC] was going to be with me, he says. He was trying to take my character apart. The transcription from the tribunal, obtained by BuzzFeed News, reveals Linden telling Pemberton, You are an errant priest, and You are not in good standing, and accusing him of being disingenuous. Cunnington had to leave the room, unable to listen to his husband being described in this way. The confrontation was formidable and fractious: two exceptionally well-educated men grappling over ecclesiastical, employment, and equality legislation, the first of which stretches back to the 16th century. You personally and in family relationships undertook that you would exemplify the teachings of the church. In marrying a man, you did not do that, did you? Linden asked, before asserting that is a matter of integrity that priests must fashion their lives in accordance with church teaching. To which Pemberton responded: As a matter of integrity, no one has the right to tell me who I can and cannot marry. It is unlawful for the bishops to say so. This was one of the warmer exchanges. View this image  Lynzy Billing Linden described Pembertons wedding as taking place amid a storm of publicity that Pemberton had created. In an exchange about whether he could have foreseen the precise consequences, during which Pemberton stated that he could not, Linden replied: The Daily Mail was able to work out the consequences of your actions. He added, You know perfectly well you had plunged the church into crisis nationally, before concluding: You got yourself in this mess. Several hours in, Linden questioned Pemberton over the decision to remove his PTO. Pemberton began to cry, humiliated by the memory. Linden responded, Crying isnt necessarily fair to the respondent. In the tribunal room, there was quite a reaction to this, says Pemberton his own barristers were taken aback. Amid the unfriendly fire, Pemberton, however, remained resolute. There was something hugely satisfying about actually being there, getting evidence heard, he says. That was a big win as far as I was concerned somebody heard my story and quizzed the other side. Also very present in my mind was that this is a test case that could be influential for other people, that this could raise in the public mind, What are the limits we want to put on the state church in its exemptions from the law of the land? There were also moments of sheer absurdity. After the final witness, Malcolm Brown, director of mission and public affairs for the Archbishops Council of the Church of England, took to the stand, He said the only thing that really mattered was not using the word marriage, says Pemberton. He said perhaps we could have called it civil partnership max. At this point, according to the transcript of the hearing, Pembertons barrister suggested the word morriage as an alternative. And he [Brown] said, Thats a joke, isnt it? Pemberton roars with laughter. Nevertheless, the four days in court, following all the events of the preceding year, proved bruising. Im not in love with the Church of England any more, he says, flatly. I have a vocation to God, not the Church of England. To be in an institution that views the nature of your relationship as rendering you unfit to work is only one aspect of this: They have this odd rhetoric about gay people. Take last year: [The church] produced some material about combatting homophobia in schools but still managed to make out [that gay peoples] sexuality made them in some ways less good people. The first part of the document in question contains the following passage: The official Church of England teaching about the human sexual act is that it is an act of total commitment which belongs properly within a permanent married relationship and that homosexual acts fall short of this ideal. Pemberton continues: Then there was some pronouncement about homophobia, how weve failed to call on people to repent of their homophobia, and I think, Hang on, its not about other people repenting their bloody homophobia, its you lot and your institutional homophobia! Pemberton stops, aware his voice is raised. Thats the problem, because actually, deep down, I think theyre still not convinced that we are good as you: G.A.Y. Such rhetoric, says Pemberton, is seriously damaging, and partly to blame for dwindling numbers in churches. The only way to rectify such absence in pews, he says, would be for the church to conduct research among church-leavers, to find out why theyve left. Why doesnt the church do that? The Church of England still has establishment and bishops in the House of Lords all sorts of privileges. It has entitlement, and entitled people dont bother asking difficult questions about whether their business is working or not. Thats the problem. Jeremy Pemberton / Facebook Jeremy Pemberton / Facebook On 4 November, four months after the hearing, the 58-page judgment came in: Pemberton had lost on all counts. The claimant would never have been in this position had he not defied the doctrine of the church, said the ruling. The claimant knowingly entered into that marriage and knew what the potential consequences could be for him. In getting married to his partner, he was flying in the face of the clear restating of doctrine in relation to same-sex marriage. I wasnt surprised, says Pemberton. Although the hearing had heartened him and his counsel, the summing up in September in which several points they thought they had established suddenly appeared shaky dampened their optimism. I wasnt expecting to win on this round. After examining the ruling, however, Pembertons lawyers were clear it is right to launch an appeal. And, he adds, We will continue for as long as we can and for as long as they tell me its right to do so. In an intriguing twist of the law, if Pemberton wins the appeal it will have stronger legal implications than if he had won initially. Employment tribunals are not courts of record but employment appeal tribunals are, he explains legal precedent will be cemented if the appeal succeeds. If the Church of England were to appeal the appeal, the case would be kicked up to the Supreme Court and eventually the European Court of Human Rights. That could take years. When BuzzFeed News asked the Diocese of Southwell and Nottingham to respond to various assertions made by Pemberton, a spokesperson replied: I do not wish to comment on the points outlined, and instead furnished BuzzFeed News with the statement the diocese released following the judgment: We are thankful to the tribunal for its work on this complex case and for its findings in favour of the former Acting Diocesan Bishop, the Rt Revd Richard Inwood, on all the claims made against him. We recognise that it has been a long and difficult process for all concerned, and we continue to hold them in our thoughts and prayers. The spokesperson also reiterated the statement the Church of England put out after the case, which included the line, Clergy do not have the option of treating the teachings of the church as an a la carte menu. Despite the strain exerted by the case and the assaults on Pembertons mental health, on his capacity to sleep, and of course on his career, the canon remains determined. In part this seems informed not only by a belief in equality and justice but also by his history. He remembers himself as a teenager, the boy who ran to God, to the church, and married a woman: I would have liked to say to him, Its fine to be you, whoever you are, he says. But as the interview ends and he talks about the seemingly never-ending legal battle ahead, something stronger glimmers in his face again, a reminder of the fuel that has powered all of this: love.

aS"Township High School District 211 and the Department of Education still continue to offer different interpretations of its requirements. View this image  Catherine Lhamon, assistant secretary for the Office Civil Rights (right), speaks at a panel in Washington, D.C. on October 1, 2015. Larry French / Getty Images A transgender student can change her clothes inside the girls locker rooms at a public school northwest of Chicago after a settlement was reached early Thursday morning between Township High School District 211 and the U.S. Department of Education. But despite the agreement, the school district and federal officials differ on the implications of the deal such as whether the settlement affects all transgender students in the district. On November 3, the departments Office of Civil Rights (OCR) found Township High School had violated Title IX, which bans gender-based discrimination in public schools, for its treatment of the transgender student for the past two years. OCR assistant secretary Catherine Lhamon told BuzzFeed News on Thursday that the settlement applies to all trans students in the district, not just the one who brought her complaint to the Department of Education in December 2013. Education Department officials also said the settlement which says the student may use a private area to change in the girls locker room can also change in the locker room like other girls. There is no requirement that she change in a private area, Department of Education press secretary Dorie Nolt told BuzzFeed News. She said she plans to, but it is not required. The student, referred to as Student A throughout the investigation, had requested the use of a private changing area within the girls locker room, such as a restroom stall. The student argued that she needed access various locker rooms at her school for mandatory physical education classes, swim classes, and sports teams. According to OCRs Nov. 3 ruling, the district superintendent had denied her request, citing the fact that there were too few stalls and too many students to accommodate her. In doing so, the OCR found by a preponderance of evidence that the district had violated Title IX laws for excluding Student A from participation in and denying her the benefits of its education program, providing services to her in a different manner, subjecting her to different rules of behavior, and subjecting her to different treatment on the basis of sex. In the settlement, the school district has agreed to grant the student access to the girls locker room at her high school and any other school in the district she visits, based on an earlier request to use private changing stations inside. The district will also install sufficient privacy curtains in the locker rooms to accommodate the transgender student and any students who wish to be assured of privacy. Students who request additional privacy apart from the curtains will have the option to change clothes elsewhere, according to the settlement. Township High School District 211 will also work with a consultant who specializes in youth gender identity to ensure the terms of the resolution are sufficiently implemented. However, according to the school district administration, the scope of the settlement will only affect one student. This agreement applies only to the student in the complaint, Township High School District 211 director of communications Thomas Petersen told BuzzFeed News. He called the OCRs assertion that it applies to all trans students inaccurate. Petersen added that if a trans student other than the one mentioned in the ruling did not change clothes in a private changing room, they could face disciplinary action. OCRs Lhamon said that this is not the case. Student As mother spoke to BuzzFeed News shortly after the OCR confirmed to her that the settlement applied to all transgender students. Her identity was withheld to ensure her daughters privacy. I am very pleased that the OCR has taken the position it has, and reaffirmed our belief that she shouldnt be required to use privacy curtains, she said. Student As mother added that her daughter had been reprimanded by school authorities for using a girls locker room, even when she was the only one in the room. Its been a long two and half years, she said. The school board met Wednesday night to approve the Education Departments settlement offer, a meeting that ran into the early hours of Thursday. Student As mother said at least three students spoke in support of her daughter at the meeting. One student started a petition urging for the students access to the girls locker room. The settlement is the latest in a series of clashes between the Obama administration and public schools over transgender students. The Department of Justice and the Department of Education, in lawsuits and settlements, has insisted that Title IX of the Education Act of 1972, which bans discrimination based on sex, therefore bans discrimination based on transgender status. But some advocates say this latest settlement doesnt go far enough. In a statement issued Thursday morning, the ACLU of Illinois, which represented the student, criticized Township High School District 211 for not supporting the extension of the new agreement to all transgender students. John Knight, who directs the ACLU Illinois LGBT and HIV Project, called the oversight a terrible mistake. No student should be labeled as different by their school, or denied full and equal participation at school with their peers, he said. Yet that is precisely what District 211 says it will continue to do, no matter what the agreement actually says.

aS"The Anchorage Assembly passed an ordinance banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in September. A group of activists is now trying to repeal the ordinance, saying it enables men to prey on girls in public restrooms. View this image  Anchorage City Hall. Bloomberg / Getty Images A radio host in Anchorage, Alaska, has launched the first stage of an effort to repeal the citys two-month-old LGBT nondiscrimination law, arguing it allows men to prey on girls in public restrooms. We do not believe that a man should be using the same bathroom as our little girls, Bernadette Wilson, host of Bernadette Live! on KFQD, told BuzzFeed News. I will leave up to your imagination what one person may do, she added. We dont think a person with male anatomy should be where a young girl is changing. Hardly a unique argument, talking points about men in womens restrooms a dig at transgender women or those ostensibly posing as transgender women has proven an effective message around the county to repeal or stymie laws protecting LGBT people. On Nov. 25, Wilson applied for a petition to place Anchorages two-month-old nondiscrimination law on the ballot. City officials have until Dec. 11 to certify the application, which contains signatures of 10 voters and a secondary sponsor, before the activists can launch a repeal campaign. Deputy Municipal Clerk Amanda Moser told BuzzFeed News petitioners would then need to collect 5,754 signatures from registered city voters to qualify the measure for the ballot. If they submit those signatures by Jan. 11, she said, the measure would go before voters on April 5. Passed by the Anchorage Assembly on Sept. 29, the ordinance bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity expanding rules banning discrimination based on race and other characteristics. Critics bristle because it allows people who identify as women to file a complaint if they are barred from womens facilities in places of public accommodation. But there is a notable absence among the petitions early proponents: leaders of a campaign in Anchorage that successfully defeated an LGBT nondiscrimination ballot measure in 2012. Jim Minnery, president of Alaska Family Council and a key player in the 2012 effort, told BuzzFeed News in October that he and other faith leaders were pondering whether to run a referendum on the citys new nondiscrimination law. They of course have a right pass what they did, Minnery said of the assembly, but we have the right to go back to the polls to see where people really stand on this. Minnery did not reply to phone calls from BuzzFeed News seeking comment on Wilsons petition. Like Minnery, Wilson was incensed that city officials would ram through a law that was rejected at the polls by a 14-point margin only three years prior. It is disappointing to see an assembly throw out the will of the people on something that we just voted on so recently, she said. Wilson could cite no examples of inappropriate behavior occurring in Anchorage restrooms since the law was enacted, nor did she know of such behavior in the 17 states and 200 cities with similar laws on the books. Nonetheless, the specter of men and transgender women using LGBT nondiscrimination laws to sexually assault girls in restrooms has become a national theme among conservatives in recent years. It was the prime battle cry of an effort to repeal such a law last month in Houston, Texas. It was also a message used to repeal similar laws in Fayetteville, Arkansas, and Springfield, Missouri. Asked if she would oppose the law if it only concerned sexual orientation, and lacked provisions for gender identity, Wilson declined to answer. I dont have time to deal with a hypothetical, she said. She also declined to say whether she believed transgender women were indeed women. They can have their transgender debate, Wilson said. The safety issue is that I dont think anyone of the opposite sex should be using the bathroom or locker room where a young girl is changing. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

This more unilateral approach to color is coinciding with societal movements toward gender equality and fluidity, the consumers increased comfort with using color as a form of expression, a generation that has less concern about being typecast or judged and an open exchange of digital information that has opened our eyes to different approaches to color usage.

aS"I kind of felt like I was putting on a different personality. View this image  As the holiday party season quickly approaches, many women may think just for a moment about rocking a suit. Most will probably dismiss the idea because going the dapper route is simply too hard or too scary. Knowing where to start when looking for a suit, especially one that fits your body type, can be straight up daunting. We wanted to take the ~fear~ out of wearing a suit, so we had a bunch of women try them on and chat about how the experience made them feel. Heres what they had to say: View this image  Lauren Zaser/BuzzFeed Lauren Zaser/BuzzFeed How did it feel to wear a suit? I dont wear suits and its very rare that Im even wearing pants in general. Pants tend to feel really restrictive and I feel most powerful when Im presenting in a hyper feminine way. But, it was fun, and exhilarating. I felt powerful in a different kind of way. I commanded a different kind of attention. I wear blazers a lot, but one of my biggest hesitations with suits is finding pants that fit. Most of the time I try on suit pants they wont fit my hips or theyll make my ass really flat. Trying this suit on has made me want to invest in one really nicely tailored suit. Lauren Zaser/BuzzFeed Hannah is wearing: H&M Black Pants, $39.99 H&M Blazer with White Piping, $39.99 (Not available online) View this image  Lauren Zaser/BuzzFeed Lauren Zaser/BuzzFeed Are you a big suit wearer? I never liked wearing dresses and I feel much more comfortable in a suit. They match my personality more and I dont find them as restrictive. Also, I think theyre a bit more casual than dresses. How do you feel when you wear a suit? I identify as a femme tomboy, so when I wear suits, I feel a bit more powerful and authoritative. I love that. I think that women should be like that anyway but I try and keep in mind that it can be intimidating to other people. Mackenzie is wearing:  Lucca Couture for Wildfang Dietrich Blazer, $148.00  Lucca Couture for Wildfang Poitier Pant, $98.00 View this image  Its usually tomboy femme clothes that are easy and simple to wear but fit for a distinctly feminine figure. Usually in strong colors /patterns. Im plus size so its kinda hard to hide all the round bits, its better to just let them be round instead of forcing them into a shape thats not natural. On my best days its Queer Yonce / New Money Missy Elliot. p(sub_buzz_grid_source_via). How do you feel wearing a suit? I tend to be a little stressed out about structured, fitted clothes of any kind because theyre really difficult to find for a plus size body. So I was pleasantly surprised that this fit! I was feeling my look a lot more than I expected to. It makes me feel my age, instead of like a garbage youth. I feel like someone would look at me and think that Im a young professional who can actually afford my student loans (which is a look that I dont pull off often). I feel like I should fucking lean in and ask for a raise. Whats something you learned from this experience? You dont have to buy tailored pants. Theres a market for fake tailored pants and you should abuse it. For me, it wouldnt be worth it to buy tight fitted pants to look good and feel uncomfortable. Eventually, Id love to get a real tailored suit. Until then, this is a pretty good work around. Krutika is wearing:  H&M Jacket with Shawl Collar, $49.99  H&M Ribbed Leggings, $24.99 View this image  Lauren Zaser/BuzzFeed Lauren Zaser/BuzzFeed Do you typically wear suits? The first time I wore a suit was a few weeks ago for a wedding. I thought it was terrible. Buying a suit was really, really intimidating. I didnt think I could buy a womens suit because I didnt think I would like a womens style. But I ended up buying a womens blazer and cropped mens trousers from ASOS. What does it feel like to wear a suit? It feels really nice to wear a suit. When I wore a suit for the wedding I decided to wear suspenders instead of a belt. I fell in love with suspenders. I felt way more confident. And suit pants make me feel like I actually have a butt. Natasia is wearing:  Lucca Couture for Wildfang Dietrich Blazer, $148.00  Lucca Couture for Wildfang Poitier Pant, $98.00 View this image  Picture long sweater dresses or jeans with heels, simple silhouettes in cool patterns and prints, and some layering to make things dressier. When I do wear something more profesh, its a little dressed down. Maybe it could be called a happy medium. Lauren Zaser/BuzzFeed Lauren Zaser/BuzzFeed How did it feel to wear a suit? I dont normally wear suits, but Iove women in suits and could look at women in suits all day. Im kind of sad to take this off, actually. I kind of felt like I was putting on a different personality. I felt like I wanted to be in front of people and I wanted to be seen. I want to put myself in some kind of spotlight. I felt like I felt really good in a suit, but maybe its just that I really liked the structure of it, and I liked the feel of being really, really well dressed. Do you have any reservations about this suit? Im waiting for a time when suits for women are given as much care as suits for men. For women, its like, oh, your dress size is a six or an eight, but it doesnt translate into suits. I want suits to want to want me.

View this image  Stephanie McCarthy, a musician, sustained a fractured eye socket, facial bruising, a busted lip and swelling behind her ear after being attacked by two men at the Newtown Town Hall Hotel in June. She told police the attack was fuelled by the fact she is transgender. Alexis Ozanne, who punched McCarthy in the head five times while Nicholas Wells held her in a headlock, was sentenced to 150 hours community service and a good behaviour bond on Tuesday. View this image  They just sent a message saying I heard the news, Im really sorry about what happened, McCarthy said. I said, What are you talking about?. They sent me a link to the article and I was absolutely devastated. McCarthy wanted to attend court in order to deliver a victim impact statement and to find some closure on the horrific incident. To say that I feel let down by the police is a massive understatement, McCarthy said. I received no text, no phone call, no email. Nothing. A spokesperson for NSW Police told BuzzFeed News they were aware of McCarthys concerns and had reviewed the communication between her and the police. Police are satisfied that all appropriate communication occurred, they said. As one of these matters is subject to an appeal period and the other matter is still before the courts, it would be inappropriate to make any further comment. Under the NSW Charter of Victims Rights, victims of crime have the right to be informed of the date and place of hearings for charges laid against the accused. They also have the right to information and assistance to prepare a victim impact statement. View this image  Its affected my life in a massive way its turned my life upside down, she said. Its taken away my security, its taken away my privacy, Ive lost an enormous amount of confidence. McCarthy also criticised the court for not giving Ozanne jail time.

aS"For Season 2 of her acclaimed Amazon Studios series Transparent, creator Jill Soloway hired an unprecedented number of transgender professionals: from onscreen talent to producers to accountants. BuzzFeed News visits the set to see what it means to have a marginalized community represented both in front of and behind the camera. Its a Saturday night in midsummer at Los Angeless Club Shine, one of the citys best parties by and for transgender women. The party is held at Oxwood Inn, a seedy bar in an unassuming suburb 25 minutes outside of L.A.; it draws droves of trans women and their admirers every week. Tonight, Hollywoods trans starlets from Amazon Studios Transparent, a group of women in their early thirties, have gathered to party with their sisters. Zackary Drucker arrives in blue jeans, high-heeled boots, and a smoky eye. Together with her fellow co-producer Rhys Ernst, Drucker handles everything on Transparent from nitty-gritty feedback on scripts to recruiting transgender actors, writers, and crew. Now, Drucker cuts through the fog machines exhaust toward her friend and colleague Van Barnes, the personal assistant to Transparents lead actor, Jeffrey Tambor. Barnes is wearing a bright chartreuse skirt cinched at the waist. She and Drucker kiss each others cheeks. Theyve been friends for more than a decade and now find themselves employed together in Hollywood. Trace Lysette, an actress on Transparent, emerges between the parted smoke. She has been perched by the bar, her hair slicked into a high bun, gold hoop earrings bouncing against her neck, and now springs from her seat toward the dance floor, moving her hips to the music. On the show, Lysette portrays a trans woman named Shea. Though shed been in the film industry for years before Transparent, she never before felt safe disclosing her gender. After twirling once or twice beneath a disco ball, she steals away from the crowd, shifting through more smoke and tightly packed partygoers, then slips out a back door into the parking lot. Resting upon a silver guardrail, she tells me that Transparent is different than any other production shes worked on. There is an underlying sense of home. View this image  Alexandra Billings and Trace Lysette. Jennifer Clasen / Amazon Studios for BuzzFeed News Since she began working on Transparent, Lysettes career has flourished. She was in an NBC pilot, Curse of the Fuentes Women, and performed alongside legend Sir Patrick Stewart in Blunt Talk, the new Starz series by Jonathan Ames. Were on a new frontier, she says. Space is being created for us. Its important we step up and take those opportunities so that the generation that comes behind us will have even more than we did. When Lysette talks about space, she doesnt just mean room at the party: Shes talking about both the cultural movement for transgender equality and the structural integration of transgender talent and staff throughout the production chain of Transparent. From creator Jill Soloway, Transparent follows the transgender patriarch turned matriarch of an upper-middle-class Jewish family, Jeffrey Tambors Maura Pfefferman, as she comes into womanhood amid the intersecting storylines of her unhinged adult children. The Amazon Studios series debuted in the fall of 2014 to instant critical acclaim, winning two Golden Globe Awards the following January and five Emmys this past September. While the entirety of Season 2 debuts on Dec. 11, the first episode, which follows Mauras family during her daughter Sarahs wedding, began streaming for Amazon Prime users on Nov. 30. Television fanatics and transgender activists alike are eager to see how the rest of the second season will measure up in terms of transgender representation and, of course, quality storytelling. While mainstream praise of the series abounds, Transparent has not escaped controversy, especially within the transgender community: Many feel the lead role should have been given to someone who is themselves transgender. Previously, there have been few major accomplishments in mainstream media for transgender representation. Candis Cayne made television history in 2007 when she portrayed a trans woman in a recurring role on ABCs Dirty Sexy Money. But it wasnt until the summer of 2013 that the issue became relevant to film industry leaders, or the general public. When Laverne Cox first portrayed a trans character in the Netflix series Orange Is the New Black, her performance dovetailed with a greater cultural and political transgender movement. Transparent has involved the creative contributions of trans people since its inception, but for the second season, Soloway has doubled down on her mission to employ trans people in every production department. Shes hired an unprecedented number of trans collaborators, including Silas Howard, who directs one of the episodes; a full-time writer, Our Lady J; and model, actress, and It girl Hari Nef. What does it take to produce a major, multimillion-dollar television show that centers on a marginalized, historically destitute population? And how important is it, really, to have members of that marginal community represented both in front of and behind the camera in productions that spotlight their storylines? The transgender community in the United States has a long history, one of survival and kinship within an inhospitable world. Trans people have come to understand their own obscurity within pop culture for many of them, its beyond surreal to see trans life start emerging in the limelight. Now, outside of the Oxwood, a woman entering the club holds the door for us, and Lysette and I dash through. Were carried back to the dance floor. There are cisgender men waiting eagerly along the wall, hoping to pick up a beautiful transgender woman. But here, the men are secondary. Women reign supreme. View this image  Zackary Drucker (center) Jennifer Clasen / Amazon Studios for BuzzFeed News I witness a similar inversion of power on a bright Monday morning when I arrive at the sunlit studios of Paramount Pictures. Its 8 a.m., and the front corridor of a tan, generic Paramount office building, where this mornings shoot is taking place, has been commandeered by Soloways feminist enterprise. Some hundred men and women mill in and out. The production crew have already shot the first several episodes of Season 2; the episode theyre shooting now falls midway through the season. Cameras, lights, and wooden directors chairs strapped with black canvas, their backs emblazoned with the shows title in orange lettering, dot the room. Jeffrey Tambor is standing near a row of monitors, talking to Silas Howard, Transparents first transgender director. (This is the first and only episode Howard has directed for the show; Season 1 was directed by Soloway and Canadian film director Nisha Ganatra.) I envy the perfect periwinkle lacquer of Tambors pedicure. It works seamlessly with his wardrobe: that of an airy, confident, and comfortable Californian woman of a certain age. His long gray wig is held by a butterfly clip. Howard leans in to give him direction for the scenes next take. As they huddle, a familiar voice sounds from my side. Barnes, Jeffrey Tambors assistant, is sitting in a nearby chair. She calls to me with one black headset strategically planted below her coiffed blonde hair, holding another in her hand. Here, honey, put these on, she says in her charming country drawl. The camera follows Maura through the L.A. LGBT Center after she receives her first prescription of hormone replacement therapy. HRT is the medication shell take to change her sex from male to female. Hormones are a rite of passage for transgender people theyre often the first step taken to transition. Id had my own version of Mauras moment myself, and Ive seen countless tearful girlfriends clutch that same crinkling paper bag of pills. Between takes, Drucker hurriedly breezes past on her way to a meeting. Barnes is seated behind the monitor to my right. Howard give actors feedback on their performances. Two trans crew members, Thomas and Zoe, help orchestrate behind the camera. Natasha London, a trans woman who works in wardrobe, is nearby and ready to assist. Four transgender extras populate the set. Outside of LGBT-centric environments, like a community center or health clinic, being trans can feel like an obstacle between you and the rest of the world. The Transparent Season 2 set feels like a trans separatist commune in the heart of Hollywood. The trans presence at Paramount isnt only evident on set. A diverse group of gender-nonconforming people are found both onscreen and off, including trans women, men, and nonbinary individuals. Nearly all of them say that the show has made a significant impact on their lives, including Rain Valdez, who is employed in accounting. Valdez has worked in postproduction for years, elevating through the ranks from assistant editor, to editor, to producer before starting account work for Transparent. Like Trace Lysette, before working on Soloways show Valdez wasnt out about being transgender at work or in most of her personal life. About a year ago I started thinking about my life and realizing that I never really looked back and appreciated what I went through, she says. To do all of that to just be in hiding, to be in secret, just didnt make any sense. In order to break free of secrecy, she went to the L.A. LGBT Center, and began to attend their trans support group, Perceptions. In the fall of 2014, Transparent debuted. Valdez was familiar with the show long before she was approached to work on the second season. Theres some scenes where [Tambor] is at the group, the transgender Perceptions group, and I was like thats my group! This is my life! I started to realize that Im kind of a success story, she added. Theres so many deaths, theres so many threats, hate crimes, and abuse I started to realize that, oh my gosh, Ive been hiding all this time when in reality I could probably be helping people. Valdez began working for the Economic Empowerment Group at the L.A. LGBT Center in order to help other trans people find success in their transitions. Unemployment in the transgender community is an epidemic. A study from 2013 titled A Broken Bargain for Transgender Workers, put out by several organizations in conjunction with the Human Rights Campaign, reveals this inequity. Among other findings, the study shows that trans workers report unemployment at twice the rate of the general population, and are nearly four times as likely to make less than $10,000 a year. The study traces this disparity to several factors, including discrimination on the job and in the hiring process. Other obstacles further clarify the cause: Trans people experience difficulty changing legal identity documents, and health care exclusions are common, limiting their options. When producers Drucker and Ernst contacted the Economic Empowerment Group at the center when they were hiring for Season 2, Valdez was thrilled. Transparent is the first place shes worked where the person running the show is a woman. I pinch myself every day, she says. View this image  Jennifer Clasen / Amazon Studios for BuzzFeed News Tambors trailer is nestled in a small colony near the soundstage. Its Monday afternoon and he is seated near a desk, his assistant close by. Hes no longer Maura, her periwinkle toes now hidden in thick leather loafers, the butterfly-clipped braid momentarily retired. This is quite a moment in America, Tambor says, referring to the contemporary transgender movement. I certainly am a contender for the luckiest actor in the room award. This past September, Tambor made history by becoming the first actor to receive an Emmy for a role portraying a transgender person. His was among five Emmys Transparent took home this year, out of 11 nominations. Clutching the golden-winged statue, he thanked the people he called his teachers, including trans producers and collaborators Ernst, Drucker, and Barnes. Earlier in his acting career, he had another teacher: someone who used to say, When you act, you have to act as if your life depends on it. And now, he said, Ive been given the opportunity to act because peoples lives depend on it. According to Tambor, the role of Maura Pfefferman changed his life. Shes given him a sense of responsibility. Tambor cocks his head to the side. His eyes narrow, and he uncrosses his legs as he underscores the greatness of a truly human transgender character. I like to say my politics are in my performance I need to know that the human quotient is there at all times. The majority of trans characters are depicted as villains, sex workers, and victims. That is beginning to change in the 21st century, but most Americans, including Tambor, are being introduced to the humanity of the trans community for the very first time. Transgender people are tired of seeing their storylines interpreted by someone outside the fold, because transgender experiences have historically been perverted and sensationalized by gawking outsiders, while the real people those storylines are based on remain oppressed and marginalized. What I love about this year is that were sort of taking the Bubble Wrap off of her, Saint Maura, Tambor says of his characters development in Season 2. The writers have explored her fallibility. Maura isnt idyllic. She is meant to be a person, with normal needs and flaws. In the season premiere, Maura has taken on a new confidence. In the beginning of the episode at her daughters wedding, when standing for a family portrait, the photographer misgenders her, saying, Chin up, sir and, clearly having had enough, Maura marches proudly away from the shoot. In another moment, during an uncomfortable confrontation with an estranged sister who cannot stomach her siblings true identity, Maura quickly pivots from an icy conversation to privately choking up at the intolerance she faces even inside her own family. Shes subject to error and anger. I love that, Tambor says. View this image  Trace Lysette (center) and Alexandra Billings (right). Jennifer Clasen / Amazon Studios for BuzzFeed News He particularly loves that the general audience of Transparent the cisgender American viewer can watch Maura and say, Im like that, when they see her short temper, her desires, and her fears. The second season will also be exploring other complex trans storylines. Hari Nef, who landed a contract at the major modeling agency IMG this past spring, makes an elusive appearance in the season premiere, which intercuts the Pfefferman present-day Jewish wedding with flashbacks to a party in 1930s Berlin, where hundreds of colorful, gender-nonconforming queers dance together with Nef in the center. Here, Transparent stays true to a tradition of ambitiously tackling uncharted chapters of the past century. Season 1 follows Maura to a 1980s cross-dresser retreat, rarely represented in pop culture, while Season 2 has leaped decades back in time and half a world away to portray the exploration of sexual and gender identity in Europe before World War II. The modern-day wedding and 1930s party run parallel until they merge when Nefs character appears in the final scene, as a figment on a patio chair outside the hotel where the Pfefferman wedding occurred. View this image  Jill Soloway (right) and Hari Nef (second from right). Jennifer Clasen / Amazon Studios for BuzzFeed News This kind of challenging trans storytelling is relatively new for the film and television industries. It wasnt long ago when trans stories, when told at all, were little more than crude caricatures. In recent years, Laverne Cox opened the door for widespread critical discourse about the casting and representation of transgender characters in television and film. The tension was palpable when, in the fall of 2013, Jared Leto portrayed a trans woman named Rayon in Dallas Buyers Club. Though Leto won an Oscar for his performance, he was highly criticized for taking a role that many felt should have gone to a transgender person. Without the transgender communitys blood-spilled history, writers would not have invented Rayon, nor would she have inspired acclaim. Letos acceptance speech at the Academy Awards failed to pay homage to that history, and thus the criticism worsened. This marked a turning point in Hollywood. It was the first time that audiences, as well as industry insiders, began to question what ethical and responsible transgender storytelling might look like. Meanwhile, Soloway was developing Transparent. The pilot was released in the winter of 2014 on the heels of Letos Rayon blunder. As she likely anticipated, Soloway received criticism for casting a cisgender actor in a trans role. That criticism has been somewhat curbed by the bigger picture of Soloways efforts. Casting is an important point in the upheaval of trans media representation, but it is only one part of a much bigger movement to empower trans film industry professionals and diversify Hollywood. Now, in Tambors trailer, I tell him that a lot of the trans crew Ive spoken with feel that Transparent has changed their lives. Tambor smiles wryly and looks toward his colleague. Yeah, he teases, everyone except for Van. I take it for granted, Barnes laughs, her eyes meeting Tambors. She began working on the show during the first season and has taken on many roles, both onscreen and behind the scenes. Last year she had a cameo role, worked in set decorating, and gave her insight in the writers room. After working with Tambor a few times, Barnes was offered a job as his personal assistant. I thought he was joking, she says. At first, she dismissed his request. In fact, shed forgotten all about it, but when the two reconvened at Transparents premiere last fall, Tambor asked again. It helps him in understanding a transgender persons past. He and I have a lot of hours together so we discuss trans issues. I do what I can to help him have a well-rounded understanding on what it really is like to be trans, and not just the 1% trans either. Transparents first season largely focused on that 1% Maura Pfefferman is an upper-middle-class white woman which led some viewers to criticize the show for representing a small, privileged aspect of trans experience. While trans women like Maura are subject to discrimination, the bulk of that burden falls disproportionately upon trans people of color living in poverty. If the general audience for Transparent is ignorant to the reality of most transgender people, then portraying the trans experience only within the context of white wealth can be considered misleading. That said, the trans people who are now a part of Transparent report major life-changing experiences and emotional catharsis. Last season, Barnes had a cameo role as a cam girl. She was laced tight in a black corset with her blonde hair teased out of fat rollers. Barnes says the scene was done very well, with compassion, and not yet another clich trans sex-work shot. She says the process helped her to let go of some of the trauma of her past. Shame doesnt live here anymore, she tells me. I lost an element of shame that had been with me for years [before] I did that scene. Here you are, a trans woman, on a soundstage at Paramount, on a set that has been built for you. All these people are clamoring to get this dramatization of you, and you realize theres no reason I should ever allow any level of shame to ever touch me anymore. View this image  Zackary Drucker, Hari Nef, Jeffrey Tambor, and Alexandra Billings. Jennifer Clasen / Amazon Studios for BuzzFeed News The Emmy banner is small in the background of Paramounts permanent New York City set, a series of buildings and streets plucked from the Northeast. It is a cool summer night in a patchwork world of fantasy. Palm trees cast long, low shadows over cobblestones. Earlier thered been a constant stream of film industry professionals hurrying across campus, but now the lot is quiet. The episodes director, Howard, strolls by. Howard has been an active participant in the queer arts for decades. In the 90s he ran a caf in San Francisco called the Bearded Lady. The venue hosted performances by greats like trans icon Kate Bornstein and feminist author Kathy Acker. In 2000 he decided to make a transgender feature film titled By Hook or By Crook, so he sold the caf. His film ran the festival circuit, earning awards at Outfest, Sundance, and SXSW, among others. Hes recently finished working on a project set in Los Angeles, featuring the transgender performer Justin Vivian Bond. Years ago, Soloway and Howard both directed shorts based on queer author Michelle Teas book Valencia. Last year Howard heard about Soloways new series, and he reached out to see if he could be involved. Howard tells me his work is very indie and hasnt historically been supported by big budgets. View this image  Zackary Drucker (right). Jennifer Clasen / Amazon Studios for BuzzFeed News As he sees it, the significance of his gender in relation to his work as a director on Transparent comes down to paradox. While trans people gain a lot emotionally, mentally, and spiritually by coming out, we sometimes lose a lot too: relationships, jobs, and social acceptance are often stripped away post-transition. Howard uses these paradoxical experiences frequently in filmmaking because it helps him recognize the depth and complexity of a character or story. Little is absolute. I dont always get to bring myself everywhere, he says. I nod because I understand all too well. In order to survive, trans people often edit out the parts of themselves that are too complicated or socially unacceptable. Many trans people hide their gender from their employers or learn to minimize that part of themselves because it can make other people uncomfortable. To be on a job where they want you to reach for the depths of everything youve been through. Were in these rooms together. Im not here alone. Early the next morning, the chaos of film production dissolves through what appears to be an average kitchen doorway. Lights, cameras, and countless crew members coil madly around each other, but the cameras lens is pointed at a scene that comes over the screen with perfect clarity. Maura is by Shaes (Lysette) side making lasagna. Davina (Alexandra Billings) is rinsing dishes. They banter the way trans women do: Shae teaches Maura about trans lingo, like ki ki and kai kai. The former basically means girl time, while the latter refers to trans ladies romancing other trans ladies. Its language I never expected to hear at Paramount Studios. I probably wouldnt have, had Lysette not improvised it into the scene. I doubt the proximity between real trans life and Hollywoods re-creation of it has ever been so close. View this image  Our Lady J, Trace Lysette, Jeffrey Tambor, and Alexandra Billings. Jennifer Clasen / Amazon Studios for BuzzFeed News Later, Davinas boyfriend joins the scene. Tambor wasnt exaggerating when he said this season theyre touching on more challenging subject matter. Sal, portrayed by Sopranos actor Ray Abruzzo, is a straight, cisgender man primarily attracted to trans women. If there are few trans role models in the media, there are even fewer for partners of transgender people. Maura picks their brains, inspired by the ease of Davina and Sals affection. Around noon, the cast gathers together with the writers, director, and producers to read the new script for the next episode. Among their fellow cast members, Judith Light, Amy Landecker, Gaby Hoffmann, and Tambor sit around a large table with bottles of Perrier. Jill Soloway is seated at one end. Drucker and Ernst follow among rows of other producers and writers. There are two large buffet tables in the hallway and scripts placed on every empty chair. Before the reading begins, we observe a moment of silence as a female rabbi sets the intention, offering an inspirational blessing for their work. She invokes prior generations of transgender people and asks those present to hold that history close to their hearts, to handle their craft with great care so these lost stories can finally be told. Near the end of the script, there is a monologue written for Davina. The script speaks to the raw quest trans women endure to be accepted and loved. Its good, but when it comes time for Billings to read, shes got something better. Billings discards whats been written for her, speaking instead from another, deeper place than the page. The room is silent as Billings speaks about violence, rejection, and survival as a trans woman of color. Eyes dart across lines to find where she is reading, but its clear it comes from her heart. Later, when I ask Billings about the scene, she confirms it was improvised. I lived it, she says. Trans writer Lady J wasnt in Los Angeles when I visited, but we spoke on the phone. J told me she hopes to bring realistic elements to the trans characters. While that likely has shown itself in the scripts, Transparent still strategically makes use of improv. Billings pours herself into Davina. Her impromptu monologue underscores the significance of having a trans person portray a trans character. In an ideal world, cisgender actors should be able to craft trans characters, just as trans actors ought to star in cisgender roles but Billings improvisation is culled from a raw well of personal experience that no cis person could possibly know. The reading concludes, and the room erupts into applause. I lived through the AIDS plague, Billings says, drawing from an electric cigarette as she walks back to her trailer after the table read. I lived through the revolution at Stonewall, and I lived through Harvey Milk. My generation goes back to when we were arrested for walking across the street. Billings explains that this history is directly related to her work on Transparent. A lot of this show is about this family whose spiritual maladies lie in their own inability to connect whats divine within them. We as trans people innately understand that. Billings is the sort of woman who will give you compassionate, stern advice that cuts to the quick. She has the calmness of an older woman whose grit and charm inseparably coalesce. Were so underrepresented, we all but disappear, she says, contextualizing the medias present fascination with transgender phenomena. This show treats us like were you and me standing here talking. And that in itself is profound. As Billings succinctly explains, Our normalcy is odd to the rest of the world. View this image  Jennifer Clasen / Amazon Studios for BuzzFeed News Its late on Tuesday afternoon, and crew members are loading into a van for one last shoot, which takes place at a recording studio down the road. A production assistant dodges clusters of actors and crew as he runs down the driveway, his arms full of sweating water bottles. He hands one to Soloway. Ive been thinking about this desire thing for female filmmakers, Soloway says, leaning against the garage. The same may be true for trans people. Because were so used to looking at filmmaking and directing as an embodiment of cis male desire, were all used to being objects in the storylines of cis male subjects. With the exception of Mauras son, Josh, Transparent overwhelmingly centers on female and queer narratives. Just the act of drawing the lines wider for what desire looks like for people who arent white cis males removes people from the object position and puts them in the subject position. When I ask her about the initiative to hire transgender people throughout the show, Soloway says, In some ways it took care of itself, because it just became part of the culture. She explains that Transparent passed the point where they were looking around and counting, Oh, theres a trans person in this department, and theres a trans person in this department. Its kind of a world now, as opposed to a program. Building a trans world on set has personal implications for Soloway. Transparent was inspired by her own transgender father, who became Moppa after coming out as trans in her seventies. When Soloway accepted her Emmy for Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series, she took the stage in a in a polka-dot-print black suit. Before honing in on the focus of her speech, Soloway thanked the goddess. View this image  Hari Nef and Jill Soloway. Jennifer Clasen / Amazon Studios for BuzzFeed News Something interesting about my Moppa, Carrie, Soloway said. She could, tomorrow, go and try to find an apartment, and in 32 states, it would be legal for the landlord to look her in the eye and say, We dont rent to trans people. We dont have a trans tipping point yet. We have a trans civil rights problem, so go to transequality.org and vote to pass the trans equality bill. Thank you. Not all filmmakers use their award acceptance as an opportunity to advocate for a political cause, but the source of inspiration for this Hollywood production comes from a community that is close to Soloways heart and mired in decades of misrepresentation, discrimination, and violence. By urging people to vote a particular way, Soloway made the political drive of her work clear, doing away with the fantasy that art exists in and of itself, outside of the world in which it was conceived. I love looking around [the Transparent set] and seeing how many trans people there are, Soloway says with a warm smile. Lysette is seated at a picnic table behind her. And I love imagining being trans and being in this world and being like, Everybodys trans! She specifically thanks two familiar producers for their help structuring the radical foundation of trans politics from which Transparent has grown. Rhys and Zackary should be named for exactly how much they do. After Soloway disappears into the recording studio, I return to the Paramount lot and head to the Transparent office. Walking up the stairs, I pass a gender-neutral bathroom and framed artwork by trans photographer Amos Mac and the Museum of Transgender Hirstory & Art. Ernst welcomes me into his office. I feel like thats kind of what Transparent is in a way: this pop culture and politics cross section, he says. It was Ernst whom Soloway called when she began developing the pilot for Transparent. His motivation to empower the trans community is personal. I have a particular affinity for helping people into the industry. Ernst worked in TV and film for 11 years before his work on Transparent began. At the start of his career he had not yet transitioned. That was really difficult. On the phone people were interested in hiring me, and then I wouldnt get the job. View this image  Silas Howard (center) and Our Lady J (right). Jennifer Clasen / Amazon Studios for BuzzFeed News He and Drucker tapped directly into L.A.s trans community to form a pool of talent that was sorely lacking in Hollywood. L.A. has one of the biggest and oldest trans pride events in the country, Ernst explains. Last summer they set up a casting table at the event and arranged corporate sponsorship for the first time in L.A. Trans Prides long history. They were so happy because they actually had a budget. With Amazons funding behind them, the organizers didnt have to worry about raising money for the production of Trans Pride on their own. In addition to getting trans people established in the industry, he and Drucker negotiated higher wages on behalf of Transparents transgender extras. They get paid more than the standard rate. We hope to set a new precedent with trans inclusion in film and television production, Drucker says, poised in her turquoise home office later that night. We hope that moving forward, more productions will include trans people, and not just on content thats trans-specific. Employment discrimination has long been an impediment to our communitys development. Coming from academia and the art world, Drucker always saw herself as a fringe artist. The throughlines in my work as an artist have always been identity, gender, relationships, performing, directing. Those things inform what I do on Transparent. Carrying her craft into the mainstream has been more than personally rewarding. Like her colleagues, she sees Transparent as an immense responsibility. Its part of a much broader cultural opportunity to empower transgender people at large. Things can change within creative industries. Hollywood in particular has the power to shape public opinion, sometimes faster than legislation. Those two things sort of work in tandem. So there is an activist and a political imperative to how we work, to the very structure of Transparent. View this image  Zackary Drucker Jennifer Clasen / Amazon Studios for BuzzFeed News I stay in Los Angeles a few more days after my last visit to the set. There happens to be a party scene filming on Wednesday, the following night, and I am invited to join the background. The scene doesnt have anything directly to do with trans people; its just a music industry party in the Hills. Nonetheless, the white marble mansion is crowded with transgender women dressed to the nines. Trans models Arisce Wanzer and Cetine Dale dance with me near the infinity pool. There are a hundred others in eccentric designer outfits surrounding a spread of fake set food, including rubber sushi circled by plastic cocktails, and the music is pumping. Before the cameras roll, someone tells us to keep dancing, even when the music turns off. Drucker is talking with Ernst in the distance. Howard focuses on the monitor. The cameraman sweeps over the front lawn, onto the polished concrete walkway, and through the front door into the party. I purse my lips, tighten my waist, and extend my hands toward the ceiling, even as the music stops. The shoot is over in a handful of hours, but it took decades to have happened at all. Transgender sisters circle their hips, toss their hair, and clasp each others hands. When the light breaks over us, I forget were filming.

aS"Joanne Latham was found hanging in her cell, the Prison Service confirmed. After receiving no response from her, staff requested permission to enter the cell. View this image  Google In a statement on Tuesday, the Prison Service confirmed that Joanne Latham, 38, had been found hanging in her cell at Woodhill prison in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, by a prison officer in the early hours of Friday morning. She had barricaded herself in and covered up the observation panel in the door. Lathams death, which was first reported by the BBC, comes just three weeks after Vicky Thompson, 21, died in another male-only prison, Armley in Leeds, West Yorkshire, following suicide threats. Although a post-mortem examination has yet to be carried out on Latham, the Prison Service set out a skeletal timeline of events at the Category A prison from Friday morning. The report revealed that at 4:02am Lathams cell was checked by a member of the prison staff, and after receiving no response from her, staff request[ed] permission to enter the cell. On discovering Latham, paramedics were called. They arrived at 5:40am and after 20 minutes, the ambulance crew ceased attempts to resuscitate her. Latham was pronounced dead at 6:20am. A Prison Service spokesman confirmed that Latham had been found unresponsive on the morning of Friday and there would be investigation into her death by the Independent Prisons and Probation Ombudsman. She had been serving a life sentence for attempted murder since 2001, and for two further attempted murders of fellow inmates. Following Vicky Thompsons death on 13 November, a vigil was held in her honour and an urgent question was posed in the House of Commons to the prisons minister, Andrew Selous. He said a policy review into transgender inmates was underway and confirmed that the figures relating to trans prisoners would be collated for the first time, along with experiential accounts. View this image  Vicky Thompson with her boyfriend Robert Steele. Ross Parry Thompsons death prompted a huge outcry from members of the public on social media, with several politicians, including Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, who said, We must reform the law urgently. Calls for such reform initially swelled following the case of Tara Hudson, 26, who in October was given a 12-week custodial sentence and sent to a mens prison in Bristol despite having lived as a woman her entire adult life. A petition to send her to an all-female prison attracted over 150,000 signatures and eventually led to her being moved to a womens prison. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The court convicted U.S. Marine Joseph Scott Pemberton of the lesser charge of homicide with a sentence of up to 12 years in prison for killing Jennifer Laude. BuzzFeed Newss Meredith Talusan is reporting from the Philippines. View this image  Jennifer Laudes mother, Julita Cabilan, holds her photograph shortly before heading to the courthouse for the expected verdict in Pembertons trial. Meredith Talusan/BuzzFeed News OLONGAPO, Philippines A Philippine court on Tuesday convicted U.S. Marine Joseph Scott Pemberton for the death of a transgender Filipina woman named Jennifer Laude. The trial was closed to press, but Pembertons lawyers said he hired Laude for sex after the two met at a club on Oct. 11, 2014. Pembertons lawyers told local media that he admitted to choking her in a nearby hotel room after discovering she was transgender, but claimed she was alive, though unconscious, when he left her. He said he felt that he was being raped he was so repulsed and so disgusted because he did not give his consent to allow a man to do that to him, one of his attorneys said in an August 2015 news broadcast, in a point that became a key part of his defense. Another of his lawyers added: Pemberton acted only in defense of his life and honor. View this image  U.S. Marine Lance Corporal Joseph Scott Pemberton, right, is escorted into a court in Olongapo on Tuesday. Romeo Ranoco / Reuters Laudes family and trans rights advocates had hoped Pemberton would be convicted of murder, which carries a sentence of 40 years to life in prison. But the judge instead convicted him of the lesser charge of homicide, with a sentence of 6 to 12 years, and fines to be paid to Laudes heirs of P4,575,520 about $97,000. The judge also added a fine of P30,000 around $635 to set a public example, to serve as deterrent to military and civilian personnel of the United States of America to respect every Filipino citizen, regardless of his or her sexual orientation. Judge Roline Ginez-Jabalde said Pembertons feeling that he was under threat could not be a defense for the killing, writing: There is no unlawful aggression that justifies [Pemberton] to defend his honor. However, she said that the mitigating circumstance of passion and obfuscation should count in Pembertons favor. Harry Roque, lead attorney representing the Laude family, said that the judge should not have used Jennifers failure to disclose her transgender status as a factor in Pembertons sentence. I am so angry about the mitigating circumstance for passion and obfuscation because this was a hate crime against the LGBT community, Roque said in the courthouse lobby following the verdict. Any bigot can now claim that they lost themselves once they found out that the person theyre sleeping with is a trans man or woman. Laudes mother Julita Cabilan also expressed dissatisfaction over the decision. Im not satisfied with 6 to 12 years given how Jennifer died, she said in the courthouse lobby. I am not content, but whats important is that he will be jailed, that our efforts were not in vain. Laudes sister Michelle added: Were happy but it still really hurts because our sibling is still dead. There was a stand-off, however, over whether Pemberton will be turned over to Philippine authorities following the verdict, as he was held at a local military camp under U.S. guard prior to the decision. Ginez-Jabaldes ruling said, Pemberton is thereby temporarily committed to New Bilibid Prison, a Philippine-controlled jail, but U.S. authorities refused to relinquish Pemberton to Philippine National Police, according to Laudes attorneys. Roque said that Pembertons attorneys had drafted a hand-written motion asking Ginez-Jabalde to clarify her order. After about an hour of deliberation, Ginez-Jabalde ordered that Pemberton be held at the Armed Forces of the Philippines Custodial Center inside Camp Aguinaldo, where Pemberton was held prior to the verdict. But instead of American guards, he will be under the watch of Philippine Bureau of Corrections personnel, and left the courthouse in a Philippine police vehicle. Ginez-Jabalde also specified that Pemberton is to be held for five days until the Philippine and American governments make final arrangements regarding his detention. Laudes death became a rallying point for transgender activists in the Philippines. The involvement of a U.S. soldier helped generate unprecedented attention to trans people in the country, who have no national legal recognition or protection from discrimination. The case also renewed controversy over the large U.S. military presence in the Philippines after American officials resisted handing Pemberton over to local authorities, citing provisions of the agreement allowing U.S. troops to operate in the country. It would be extremely unfair for Pemberton to remain in U.S. custody, Laudes sister, Marilou, told BuzzFeed News shortly before the verdict was announced. He should be imprisoned here because this is where he committed the crime. We should be able to see him and visit him. They will not let us go to the U.S. if he is imprisoned there.

aS"Officially, former college wrestler Michael Johnson was on trial for not telling his sexual partners that he had HIV. But inside the courtroom, the man known as Tiger Mandingo was also up against Americas attitudes on race and sexuality. SAINT CHARLES, Missouri Michael Johnson was finally getting his day in court. Best known by his screen name, Tiger Mandingo, the black, gay, HIV-positive college wrestler with a chiseled body had been accused of infecting two men with the virus and of recklessly exposing four others to it. Under Missouri law, HIV-positive people must tell all their sexual partners that they are infected, even if they practice safe sex. Johnson was accused not merely of keeping his HIV status to himself, but of willfully lying to his partners, telling them he was HIV-negative before engaging in what the prosecutor would call the most dangerous form of sex: ejaculating without a condom into the rectums and mouths of his sex partners. As his lawyer tried to negotiate a plea deal, the 23-year-old Johnson rejected the idea, even after a friend visited him in jail and begged him to reconsider, and even though Johnson said he had spent months in solitary confinement, not even allowed to go to church. He was innocent, he said, and had confidence in the American criminal justice system. So on May 11, he was in St. Charles County court, where the judge and the lawyers began to choose the 12 jurors who would decide if he would spend the rest of his life in prison. No one had shown up to support him. His own mother wasnt there; she would arrive late and leave before his trial ended. His only ally that morning was his public defender, Heather Donovan, a petite white woman in a gray suit, and she stood up in front of the pool of potential jurors and told them that her client wasguilty until proven innocent. Amid groans in the courtroom, the judge, Jon Cunningham, reminded Donovan that shed meant to say the opposite: that her client was innocent until proven otherwise. Things never got better for Johnson, who has become one of the most highly publicized targets of Americas controversial HIV laws, which make it a crime for HIV-positive people to have sex without first disclosing that they have the virus. When actor Charlie Sheen announced that he is HIV-positive last month, he said that at least two of his sexual partners had been warned about his health status. But another of his sex partners came forth to say the actor never told her that he has HIV, potentially opening him up to prosecution under Californias law. Many prosecutors defend HIV laws as offering just punishment for behavior that can help transmit the virus. But critics say the laws unjustly place all responsibility on the person with the virus: While Johnson faced up to life in prison, his partners bore no legal liability, even though they all willingly engaged in unprotected sex acts during casual hookups with Tiger. More fundamentally, AIDS advocates say, the laws are outdated and harsh. If decades-long sentences ever were appropriate, they say, they arent anymore, given the tremendous medical advances in HIV care. Indeed, many epidemiologists and AIDS advocates say the laws which single out HIV can actually fuel the epidemic by making people afraid to get tested and treated, and by fostering the dangerous belief that only the HIV-positive person is responsible for preventing transmission of the virus. But what propelled Johnsons case into headlines as far away as Australia was the volatile combination of race and sex epitomized by his own screen name, Tiger Mandingo. Many of Johnsons sex partners including four of the men he was charged with exposing to HIV were white. And almost every news account featured photos that Johnson had posted on social media of his dark-skinned, muscular, and often shirtless torso. That lurid fascination with Johnsons black body carried over into his trial. Arrested and charged in an overwhelmingly white community where anti-gay beliefs are widespread, the gay, black Tiger never stood a chance. Over five days, as a procession of sex partners and medical experts, as well as Johnson himself, testified, what unfolded was a courtroom drama that on the surface pitted an aggressive prosecutor against a hapless public defender, but that in a deeper sense pitted Johnson against Americas deeply entrenched attitudes about race and sexuality. View on Instagram A photo of Michael Johnson posted to his Instagram account. instagram.com Characterized by his sexual partners as being very large, too tight for condoms, and too big to fit in a mouth due to his large size, Johnson/Tigers penis was described in unusually graphic and at times almost absurd detail in police reports and later on the stand. It would even be shown to jurors in still images from a sex tape that he and one of his partners made. The soft-spoken former university student had shown up to court in a blue shirt and a bright red tie, but standing trial was his black, ejaculating, HIV-positive penis. Of the 51 potential jurors, only one appeared to be nonwhite a female, African-American retired nurse and all identified as straight. Most looked to be in their fifties or older. During questioning, about half of the would-be jurors said being gay was a choice. Only a third agreed that being gay was not a sin. No potential juror acknowledged having HIV. All said they believed HIV-positive people who do not tell their sexual partners that they have the virus should be prosecuted. When asked, not a single person said they had any distrust of the police. (The quotations from this trial are from the reporters notes. Following directions from the court, BuzzFeed News did not record the proceedings, and the court has declined to make transcripts available.) When the prosecutor, Philip Groenweghe, made arguments from notes, he confidently lifted his eyes from his papers to make eye contact with whomever he was addressing. But much of the time, his arguments were so polished, and he seemed so confident in them, that he spoke eloquently and persuasively without notes. His hands went in and out of his pockets as he emphasized points, and he grabbed his lapels or took his glasses off with dramatic effect. He stalked the courtroom, never asking the judge for permission to approach the bench. He would drop his voice to sound reasonable while addressing jurors, but he sometimes yelled and jabbed his finger at witnesses. Donovan, who appeared many years Groenweghes junior, clutched her notes, the papers sometimes shaking. Donovan routinely asked Judge Cunningham for his permission to approach the bench (as did the female prosecutor), and she rarely made eye contact with anyone. When she spoke, she often stammered and stumbled over her words. (Donovan did not respond to requests for comment.) Groenweghe was backed up at all times by another attorney, Jennifer Bartlett, and an omnipresent paralegal, along with a rotating cast of four or five police detectives, assistants, specialists, and a victims advocate sitting right behind them in the first bench of the galley. All were dressed in somber business suits. Groenweghes boss, Republican St. Charles County Prosecuting Attorney Timothy Lohmar, is a rising attorney from a local political dynasty (the trial took a recess for the funeral of his father, a former judge). Meanwhile, save for an assistant who would come into the courtroom once or twice a day for a few minutes to deliver papers, and who was often dressed in casual jeans and a blouse, public defender Donovan was alone except for her client, whom she often did not acknowledge, even neglecting to greet him most times he was led into court. Judge Cunningham, who had a soft, lilting voice, presided over the courtroom with a light air. He didnt interject, and he would often pause in contemplation before overruling or sustaining an objection. But he usually ruled against Donovan. Weeding out whom he didnt want on his jury, Groenweghe repeatedly asked the kinds of questions (and heard the kinds of answers) about homosexuals one can no longer ask about black people outright. A handful of the younger potential jurors said positive things about gay people, but many used words such as sick, wrong, and immoral. Groenweghe later told BuzzFeed News he was trying to weed out anyone who was anti-gay but none of the younger potential jurors made it onto the jury. Later, during the actual trial, Groenweghes balding head and thick neck would turn almost red as he described the lifestyle of homosexuals. When talking about HIV and gay sexual acts, he spat out the words semen, blood, and mucus membrane. (He later said he was being precise about medical terminology.) But he spoke relatively evenly for nearly two hours during jury selection, using his time to build the central argument he wanted his eventual jurors to buy and to screen out potential jurors who might not buy it: Whenever HIV-positive people dont tell their sexual partners that theyre positive, thats a crime, even if their partners didnt ask or were promiscuous. Donovan spoke for only about 10 minutes during jury selection, and brought up prejudice and racism rarely, such as when she asked potential jurors if they would have a problem talking about interracial gay sex acts. When the jury was finally selected, it was made up of four white men, seven white women, and the black retired nurse, all proclaiming to be HIV-negative and straight. A couple of the jurors may have been in their forties, but most appeared to be in their fifties or sixties. View this image  Chris Whetzel for BuzzFeed News Once the trial began, it quickly became clear that the State of Missouri v. Michael L. Johnson was not a case of he said versus he said, but of he said versus they said. Each of Johnsons six sex partners called to the stand testified that they asked Johnson before they hooked up if he was clean or STD-free, and that hed assured them he was. But their testimony occasionally contradicted what they had initially told police, sometimes on crucial points. The jury never heard about several of these discrepancies, because Donovan sometimes failed to pounce on them during cross-examination, and when she did, she was often overruled. Even when the accusers testimony wasnt contradictory, it revealed the complicated, murky decision-making that happens in sexual hookups. The sex partners all said the sex was consensual they willingly engaged in sex that could transmit HIV yet they often used passive language to describe how it was theyd come to have unprotected sex with Johnsons huge penis on the black sheets of his Lindenwood University dorm room. Dylan King-Lemons, a lithe young blonde man, was the person who first pressed charges against Johnson, prompting the prosecution to search for other alleged victims. And his accusation was one of the most serious: Johnson had not merely exposed him to HIV Johnson had actually infected him. Lemons testified that he began his sexual relationship with Johnson on Jan. 26, 2013, when they were both students at Lindenwoods suburban campus west of St. Louis. Lemons said he was regularly tested for HIV, always asked his partners if they were HIV-positive, and wanted to use a condom with Johnson. But, he testified, Johnson told him that he was HIV-negative, that the condom was too tight and too small, and that they dont make condoms in his size. So, Lemons said, he agreed to have unprotected sex in the traditional female role and said that Johnson ejaculated inside his anus. About two weeks later, Lemons testified, he went to Mercy Hospital with severe stomach pains. He was hospitalized twice, for a total of 14 days, according to his testimony and that of his attending physician, Dr. Otha Miles. Lemons was eventually diagnosed with gonorrhea and HIV. The timing of what was said to be Lemons HIV flu, which can sometimes occur shortly after someone is exposed to the virus, and the fact that they both had gonorrhea formed the circumstantial basis of evidence tying Lemons diagnoses to Johnsons. But no scientific tests, such as genetic fingerprinting of the virus, were performed to determine if Lemons strain of HIV was the same as Johnsons. In his opening statement, Groenweghe said Lemons knew Johnson had to be the one who infected him because he was the only person hed had sex with in the prior 11 months. On the stand, Lemons also testified that he hadnt had sex with anyone else in nearly a year meaning he wouldnt have had sex with anyone but Johnson from January or February of 2012. But when he first went to police, Lemons said that he had been able to narrow it down between two people Johnson and another sexual partner, a woman because of the time frame his doctor had given him for the date he was likely infected, six months before his hospitalization. His relationship with the woman, he told Detective Stepp, lasted from May 2012 until the end of November 2012. He told Stepp that he had had sex with a total of six people in his life and that a state public health officer told him that all of them except Johnson had tested negative for HIV. In the police report, a woman described as Lemons best friend, who was questioned separately, told Detective Stepp she believed Lemons had been dating a third person, about 8.5-9 months prior to Lemons getting sick. It could not be determined if this person was one of the five people the state public health officer said had tested negative. According to the police report, the friend said that both the other people Lemons had been seeing were very promiscuous. View on Instagram instagram.com Lemons declined to comment, as did one of his two other sex partners. The second one could not be reached, and Lemons friend did not respond to requests for comment. In her cross-examination, Donovan did not press Lemons on the discrepancies between his testimony and what he initially told the police, nor did she mention his other sexual partners points that bear on Lemons credibility and cut to the very heart of the allegation that Johnson was the person who infected Lemons. (Later, she tried to ask his physician if Lemons had had sex with an old friend, but Groenweghe objected, successfully, on grounds that the doctor wouldnt know who his sexual partners were.) In court, she did not point out that the prosecution offered no scientific evidence that Lemons and Johnsons viral strains matched. In the police report there is a passage in which Lemons seems afraid that the tables will be turned and that he, the accuser, might become the accused. After Lemons finally got out of the hospital, he told Detective Stepp, he met up with Johnson and told him he was HIV-positive. They then had sex again, and again without a condom. Detective Stepp wrote: I asked Lemons if he was forced to have sex and if he thought he was raped. Lemons stated that he was not raped and he doesnt want [Johnson] to go down as a rapist. Lemons proceeded to say, I dont think I was raped but I dont want this to come back on me. I told him I was HIV positive and highly contagious. Lemons advised that he told [Johnson] that he wasnt going to fight having sex but it would be very stupid if they did. Lemons advised that he wanted to have sex but he didnt want to infect [Johnson]. Lemons said several times that he wanted to be clear that he didnt feel he was raped but he wants me to know he warned [Johnson] of his HIV diagnosis. At trial, Lemons testified that he is now engaged to marry a man who is HIV-negative and that they have never had sex not even with condoms out of fear of transmission. Lemons also testified that without health insurance, his hospitalization plunged him $100,000 into debt and that he had to declare bankruptcy. A search by BuzzFeed News of online court databases such as PACER turned up no record of him having filed bankruptcy, and Groenweghe told BuzzFeed News, I didnt check bankruptcy records. Another witness, Andrew Tryon, was a tall, thin, blonde Lindenwood University cheerleader. He and Johnson consensually filmed their sexual encounter, and stills from the video were printed and handed out to to the jury. Groenweghe said they showed Johnson topping Tryon, ejaculating on his back, then using his fingers to feed Tryon what Groenweghe called HIV-infected semen. When the jurors looked at the stills, their faces were stoic and impassive. On the stand, Tryon testified that the sexual encounter hed had with Johnson matched what the tape showed. But in his initial police report, Tryon describes having sex with Johnson on three different occasions, and none matched what the video showed. For example, in cross-examination, Donovan got Tryon to admit hed first described jacking Johnson off before swallowing his semen, not having Johnson ejaculate on his back, as the video showed. Wiry and pale, Charles Pfoutz took the stand. He spoke in a clipped and breathless manner, and the portion of his head not covered by a hat looked shaved. His charges against Johnson were not filed until hed been in jail for a year and a half, right before the trial. Pfoutz admitted to prosecutor Jennifer Bartlett that he had a previous criminal record, having pleaded guilty to a burglary in November 2009. Pfotuz testified that hed told Detective Stepp that he got tested regularly for HIV every other month, he said. Yet he also testified that hed had unprotected receptive intercourse with Tiger Mandingo at that point he didnt know Johnsons real name the day they met on Jackd, a gay hookup app similar to Tinder. In her cross-examination of Pfoutz, Donovan had her most effective moment. She lashed Pfoutz to his previous deposition, in which he had said under oath that when hed first found out he was HIV-positive hed told medical personnel that hed been having sex with only one man and it wasnt Johnson. Pfoutz said hed been having sex since 2007 with that man, and that they were monogamous. Donovans cadence sped up while parrying with Pfoutz, whose eyes got wider and speech got faster, in one of the only times in the trial in which Donovan looked the person she was addressing in the eye. Pfoutz looked shaken when he left the stand, and the next recess was the only occasion when chatter among court observers revealed any sense that the defense had discredited a witness. Filip Cukovic, a slim Serbian exchange student, testified that he found Johnson unusual because he was black, and there were only white people in his home country. Johnson was charged with exposing him to HIV after having anal intercourse with and without a condom before ejaculating on the side of Cukovics head. Detective Stepp wrote that after being with Johnson, Cukovic was scared to even touch himself. Christian L. Green, a skinny African-American man, testified in a soft-spoken voice that he bottomed for Johnson, without ever considering using a condom: After I asked him if he was clean, I didnt think about it. Montel Moore, another slim black man, testified that although he bottomed for Johnson without protection, he pushed Johnson off before he could ejaculate inside him. Moore initially told police that he he did everything opposite that he would normally do that night, including that he doesnt have random sex with strangers, is usually not the receiver of anal sex, doesnt perform oral sex, and always wears a condom. According to the police report, Moore also said that while having sex with Johnson, his roommate came home early and walked into the dorm room. Moore further stated that Tiger quickly jumped into the bathroom. Moore explained that his roommate is also gay and that they had been involved in a relationship last year. Moore advised he thought he had to deceive his roommate to avoid any drama. Moore explained that he had told his roommate that he had invited Tiger over to surprise him with a three-way. But the credibility of Johnsons partners was not on trial not as to whether they may have exposed themselves to HIV through other sexual encounters, or if they were to be believed about what they were saying about Johnson, and least of all if they bore any responsibility for the sex they consented to. Groenweghe kept the focus on whether or not Johnson told them he had HIV. The doctors and medical experts who took the stand provided evidence that clearly hurt Johnsons case. But when two of them tried to testify that HIV is a manageable disease that with current therapies a person with the virus can expect to live almost as long as someone without it Groenweghe objected vociferously. By doing so, he managed to curtail a crucial point: HIV today is nothing like the death sentence it was in 1988, when Missouri passed the law that Johnson was on trial for breaking. Those medical personnel who met and examined Johnson personally nurse practitioners Marianne Adolf and Kelly Martin, and Missouri Department of Health epidemiologist Frank Lydon testified that Johnson had indeed tested positive for HIV before he had sex with the six partners, and that hed been treated for gonorrhea at least three times. They also confirmed that Johnson acknowledged his HIV infection and that he had received HIV counseling several times and been repeatedly told that failing to disclose was a felony. According to a police report, a health department document noted that Johnson was not informing his partners of his sexually transmitted infections. Groenweghe asked Adolf, a plump, middle-aged white woman with thinning straw hair and glasses, to describe how a condom could be blown up like a balloon until it was big enough to fit over someones head. This was designed to expose as bogus the excuse Tryon and Lemons said Johnson gave that he was too big or the condoms were too tight. But the most damaging testimony came when Martin said Johnson told her he wasnt sexually active when he clearly was, a lie that prosecutor Groenweghe hammered home. Dr. Otha Miles, an African-American doctor at Mercy Hospital who treated Lemons and testified for the prosecution, called HIV a terminal disease. But the defenses medical witnesses Dr. David Hardy of UCLA Medical School and Dr. Rupa Patel of Washington University in St. Louis and Barnes-Jewish Hospital strongly disagreed that HIV is a terminal disease when treated properly. Patel testified that most people are afraid of HIV because of stigma and what they learned in the 1980s. But, when treated properly by taking as little as one pill a day, she said, life expectancy should be normal. She added that some patients need to see a doctor only every six to twelve months. Among HIV experts, Patels and Hardys views are anything but controversial. A 2013 study estimated that a person in the United States or Canada who contracts HIV at age 20 and gets treatment is expected to live into their early 70s, a life expectancy approaching that of the general population. Even if Johnson had transmitted HIV to Lemons, Hardys and Patels expert opinions were that it was the transmission of a treatable disease, and not of a death sentence. But when Patel attempted to compare HIV to other chronic medical conditions arguing, for example, that HIV can be easier to treat than diabetes Groenweghe successfully interrupted her arguments by objecting that she was trying to add unsolicited information to a yes-or-no question. Then, during cross-examination, Groenweghe attacked Patel, yelling, Youre supposed to be a scientist! Who, he demanded, did she work for: the public defender paying her, or objective science? Groenweghe pointed out that Dr. Patel had not examined Johnson personally and he accused her of not having reviewed all of Johnsons medical records. Ultimately, he turned his ire on the public defender herself, accusing Donovan of withholding information from her witness. Donovan objected loudly, saying she resented Groenweghes accusations. Judge Cunningham called the lawyers to the bench. From about 20 feet away, Donovan could be heard crying, telling the judge she was doing the best she could and working with what she had, and that she was being personally attacked by Groenweghe. Her crying got louder as she said, You are going to need to have a new trial in a few minutes because I am going to be disqualified. Donovan then stormed out of the courtroom, abandoning an incredulous-looking Dr. Patel on the stand and leaving Johnson looking bewildered. When Donovan came back in, her eyes still puffy, the bailiff brought her tissues. The judge called a recess for 15 minutes, which stretched to nearly an hour until Donovan returned. On the last day of testimony, Johnson took the stand in his own defense. His own mother and two of his friends said they didnt want him to do so. He has learning disabilities and by his own account does not read or write very well. When Donovan asked him how hed gotten to college, intending for him to explain his athletic scholarship, he answered her literally, saying hed gotten to Lindenwood University by taking a bus. But he spoke calmly, deliberately, and slowly, testifying that he had disclosed his HIV status to each of his six of his partners prior to having sex and that he remembered doing so with each one. Still, while the jury never got to see how some of Johnsons accusers contradicted what they said in police reports, the jury saw Johnson appear to contradict himself on video. Groenweghe played a clip of Johnson being interviewed (without a lawyer present) by Detective Stepp in 2013. Johnson and Stepp, both in the courtroom, silently watched themselves onscreen. In the clip, Detective Stepp hands Johnson a photo and asks who it is. Johnson says he doesnt know. Groenweghe pounced. The photo showed Lemons. How could Johnson not know when questioned in 2013 who Lemons was yet on the stand in 2015 remember that he had disclosed to him? He must have been lying then, or lying now, or both. Groenweghe then played an audio tape of Johnson in jail talking with Meredith Mills, who befriended Johnson when he played soccer with her stepson and has remained close to him. On the tape, Johnson said it was difficult to tell her something. The clip was very short and the context unclear, but Groenweghe said the exchange was about how hard it was coming out to Mills as HIV-positive. Mills and Johnson later told BuzzFeed News that he was speaking about coming out as gay. By the time he left the stand, Johnson had admitted he was only pretty sure he had disclosed. View this image  Chris Whetzel for BuzzFeed News Groenweghe smiled throughout the last day, his eyes twinkling as he delivered his closing arguments and recapped one piece of evidence against Johnsons credibility after another: Johnson contradicting himself on video and audio, Detective Stepps testimony about how he investigated Johnson, the testimony of the medical personnel who said they explained to Johnson that not disclosing would be a felony several times, and the collective testimony of all six men who said Johnson had told them he was not infected. Groenweghe warned the jurors that they needed to keep the public safe from Johnson who roamed the world with a calling card of HIV with a tint of gonorrhea mixed in by convicting him and locking him up forever. In her closing statement, Donovan repeated that her client had testified that he had told his partners that he was HIV-positive, and she made points she had been unable to get in during her cross-examinations. For the most serious charges of HIV transmission, she highlighted Lemons contradictory stories on the stand and in previous statements, and she said he altered the date when hed had an HIV test all of which, she said, bring reasonable doubt into when Mr. Lemons contracted HIV and from whom. Regarding Pfoutz, she said he didnt even approach the police until more than a year after hed said his sole sex partner was someone other than Johnson. That evening, just about two hours after closing arguments were finished, the jurors signaled that they had reached a conclusion. They found Michael Johnson not guilty on all charges involving Pfoutz. But, they found Johnson guilty of recklessly transmitting HIV to Lemons and of exposing or attempting to expose the four other men to HIV. The following morning, the jury convened to hear evidence and arguments on what sentence they should give Johnson. For the transmission conviction alone, the minimum was 10 years, while the maximum, according to the statute, was 30 years to life. What you have seen and heard so far is only the tip of the iceberg, Groenweghe said in his opening statement. Now we can tell you more. Groenweghe went on to say that although the charges were about the six people whod given testimony, the jury was going to hear about 32 more sex videos made with other sex partners. They would also hear about people who had come forward after news broke about Tiger Mandingo but who had declined to press charges against Johnson, including an unnamed married man who, Groenweghe said, didnt want to press charges because he didnt want his wife to find out. Christine King-Lemons, the mother of Dylan King-Lemons, testified for the prosecution at sentencing and told the jury to send Johnson away for life in prison. Dylans diagnosis is a life sentence without parole, she said through tears. So I ask each of you: Why does Michael Johnson deserve any less? Mills, whose stepson had played soccer with Johnson, was the only witness to speak on his behalf. Mills described him as a gentle giant who had become a member of her family after hed been befriended her stepson. Johnson, she added, was very good with her young daughter, who has severe emotional needs. View on Instagram instagram.com But on cross-examination, Groenweghe asked her why, after Johnson had been arrested and was in jail, she hadnt instructed him to tell officials whom he had slept with. She said she knew her phone calls were being recorded and might be used against him as they were. Groenweghe accused her of not caring about the mothers of the other affected young men. Johnsons mother, Tracy Johnson, did not testify. In his final arguments to the jurors, Groenweghe called Johnsons accusers promiscuous. Hands in his pockets, eyes downcast, he told the members of the jury that these young gay men have a lifestyle I dont understand, that many of us dont understand. But, he said that HIV criminalization laws werent put on the books by legislators just to protect them, but to protect the public health including the health of the jurors. Compared with the murder cases hed tried in his career, Groenweghe said, this one was worse: A murder ended when a gun or knife killed someone, but the AIDS virus that passed through Johnson could still be killing people for years. From the perspective of HIV and its mindless agenda, he said, Michael Johnson was the perfect host, because he helped the virus spread by having sex with one young man after another. HIV could wind up killing someone who had never heard of Tiger Mandingo and who might not even be gay like, he said, the wife of the man who didnt press charges. While the jury was sequestered to deliberate the sentence, spectators filled the courtroom for one of the only times during the trial. But not present was Mills, who had to return to Indianapolis to care for her children, or even Michaels mother, who had hitched a ride back to her home in Indiana with Mills. Kimber Mallett a professor of the class in which Johnson was arrested almost two years before was the sole person present who knew him and would see what would happen to him. It took the jury about an hour to return with a sentence. As the gallery rose for them to file in for the last time, crying and sniffling were audible from several people in the warm room, including from the forewoman of the jury. When Judge Cunningham read that the jury was condemning Johnson to 30 years in prison for HIV transmission, there was an audible gasp in the chamber. There was absolute silence as he announced an additional 30.5 years of sentencing for three counts of exposure and one attempt to expose to HIV meaning Johnson could serve 60.5 years in prison if the judge ordered the sentences to be served consecutively. Cunningham scheduled a final sentencing hearing for July, when hed decide if Johnson would spend three decades or six in prison, and the trial of Tiger Mandingo was adjourned. In a post-trial interview in November, Groenweghe said that the jurys verdict not guilty on one count but guilty on the others showed that they were fair. He added, I think it shows how seriously they took the public health problem. To think of HIV as anything other than a terminal disease was awfully foolish, he said. It could be managed, he conceded, but has no cure. Groenweghe also dismissed any suggestion of racial bias. His office had reviewed HIV prosecutions in St. Charles County and found that only two of the six defendants, or 33%, were African-Americans clear evidence, he said, that there was no racial bias. But in Missouri, blacks make up less than 12% of the population and in St. Charles, less than 5%. A few days after the trial, Johnson gave an exclusive hourlong interview to BuzzFeed News from behind a glass wall in the St. Charles County jail. Handcuffed, he had difficulty holding the black intercom phone to his ear. Johnson said hed expected nothing worse than a hung jury. But, he said, the jurors didnt believe him when he testified that he had told his sexual partners he was infected because the jury didnt believe a person would ever be with a person sexually who was HIV-positive. Asked about the video that showed him denying he knew who Lemons was, Johnson said he was trying to remember who the person in the photo was and said that if the prosecutor would have let the video go on, it would have shown him eventually identify Lemons. An email obtained by BuzzFeed News shows Johnsons lawyer was negotiating a plea deal of 10 years, which Johnson nixed. But he had no regrets, he said. I could have been home sooner with my family, and theyd have loved me to come home, Johnson said. But I was never going to take a plea because it would have been morally wrong, he said. I wasnt raised to give up because something is hard. Johnson said he was embarrassed that his family heard things about my sex life and about me being promiscuous. No one was meant to see the sex tapes, he said, and he was mortified that Groenweghe made it seem as if hed made them with 30 people. Johnson said he made the videos with repeat partners who, like Tryon, agreed to be taped. Johnson said he was still being held in solitary confinement up to 23 hours a day, as he had been for several months. Yet he displayed a steadfast faith in the criminal justice system, along with a belief that he will ultimately be found innocent on appeal. I couldnt just let it be because Im black, and Im in a place where being gay and HIV-positive is hard, that you shouldnt still believe that the system works. Asked about facing 30 years in prison, Johnson said, Ive thought a lot about how this is something that could happen to other HIV-positive people. If I didnt stand up, who would? I learned from this trial how wrong it is to criminalize people with HIV. Once you have it, you have it for the rest of your life. You will be looking over your shoulder forever, fearing someone could say, This person didnt tell me. Lock him up! On July 13, Judge Cunningham ruled that Johnson could serve his sentences concurrently and sentenced him to 30 years in prison. His attorney filed for appeal a few days later, and he has been moved to the Fulton Reception and Diagnostic Center, a Missouri state prison about a two-hour drive west of St. Louis. Lawyers said its not clear when Johnson might be eligible for parole. If he serves his full sentence, he would be set free when he is 52 years old but when released he would still be a registered sex offender. Johnson has no prior criminal record something his public defender did not highlight for the jury. Still, his sentence is longer than the average sentence for almost every other crime in the state. According to the Missouri Department of Corrections, Johnsons sentence exceeds the average for physical assault (19.9 years), forcible rape with a weapon (28.2 years), and even second-degree murder (25.2 years). After the trial, Filip Cukovic, one of Johnsons sex partners, said that while HIV laws should stay on the books, Getting 30 years for exposing someone to HIV is just silly. He added, It would be better for him if hed killed someone instead. Recent prosecutions outside of Missouri involving HIV have resulted in far less severe punishments. In Washington in 2014, a Seattle man charged with transmitting HIV to eight men was was placed under court order and sent to counseling. In California this year, a San Diego man was given six months in jail for lying to his partner about having HIV and ordered to stay off of hookup apps such as Grindr. And in February, judges of the nations highest military court, the U.S. Military Court of Appeals, overturned the HIV conviction of an HIV-positive Air Force sergeant because prosecutors failed to prove that any of his sexual acts at a swingers party were likely to transmit HIV to his partners. But in Missouri, two months after Johnson was sentenced, David Lee Mangum of Dexter was sentenced to 30 years for exposing others to HIV. Missouris harsh sentences cut against a national trend in medicine, which is moving away from dealing with HIV as a criminal matter. A wide swath of medical authorities including the American Medical Association, the Association of Nurses of AIDS Care, and even the medical director for corrections medicine for the Saint Louis County Department of Health believe prosecuting people for not disclosing their HIV status could facilitate an increase in its transmission and harm the public health. Even Charles Pfoutz, the accuser whose testimony did not lead to a conviction, said he didnt think Johnson deserved 30 years and should have gotten like in California, six months to a year. In a phone interview in October, Pfoutz said he initially told the prosecuting attorney, Its fifty-fifty. Im responsible, hes responsible for his HIV transmission. Which raises a question: Who gave Johnson HIV? Johnson says he cant say who. Theres always an idea, but I wouldnt want to say if I dont know for sure. If he did, would he want them prosecuted? No, I wouldnt wish harm on anyone, he said, shaking his head slowly behind the thick jail glass. I wouldnt want this to happen to anyone. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"A new trial will give 3700 people access to the drug for free. View this image  NSW health minister Jillian Skinner announced 3700 places would be made available for gay men in a new trial of the drug, which is currently not listed on the federal governments pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The trial, which is set to begin in early 2016, will dramatically increase the number of gay men who currently have access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and is expected to dramatically reduce the number of new HIV diagnoses in NSW. The move has been hailed as a game changer by Nicolas Parkhill, CEO of ACON, the HIV prevention, HIV support and LGBTI health organisation. Here in NSW, the project will play a vital role in helping us realise our goal of eliminating HIV transmission by 2020. As a result of this initiative, 3700 people at high risk of HIV transmission will soon be much better protected from acquiring HIV, he said. When we combine this with our increasing rates of HIV testing among gay men and stronger uptake of treatment among people with HIV, we have the potential to deliver the biggest reduction in HIV transmission rates in NSW for more than 20 years. This is an incredibly exciting development in terms of the HIV prevention landscape. View this image  The addition of PrEP to our states HIV response brings us a step closer to our goal of achieving the virtual elimination of HIV transmissions by 2020. PrEP is recommended by the World Health Organisation and other international expert bodies for people who are at high risk of acquiring HIV infection, Mrs Skinner said. It has been shown to be very effective in preventing HIV infection. The NSW HIV Strategy notes a 15% increase in HIV testing in the past year, a levelling off in the rates of new HIV diagnoses and the lowest number of new diagnoses (247) since 2010. The three measures of success in the fight against HIV - testing, new diagnoses and treatment - are all heading in the right direction, Mrs Skinner said. NSW is the only major Australian state achieving declines in newly-diagnosed HIV infections. Internationally, only San Francisco [which has seen a high uptake in PrEP use] is achieving a higher rate of decline in new infections. View this image  The high cost disproportionately effects those most at risk of contracting HIV - gay men and transgender women on low incomes, sex workers, and injecting drug users. Dr Bob Grant, who has been studying HIV and the efficacy of PrEP for over 30 years, recently published a landmark study showing the PrEP is 99% effective when taken daily. Other studies have put the drugs efficacy rate at 92%. PrEP works when its taken, he told a community forum in Sydney in September. Ive never seen an HIV infection from someone taking it four times a week or more. In San Francisco, the epicentre of PrEP use in the U.S., HIV infection rates have reduced by 30% in the last two years as PrEP use increases. (This isnt entirely attributable to PrEP, but the drug certainly plays a large part). Parkhill told BuzzFeed News he is hopeful todays announcement by the NSW government will be replicated around Australia. Until PrEP is placed on the PBS, this is the quickest and easiest way to get people taking it. Were really hopeful that by the end of next year we will have seen a huge reduction in new HIV infections. Victorian health minister Jill Hennessy has announced new guidelines for doctors to prescribe off-label PrEP, which will allow greater access to the drug until it is approved on the PBS.

Accordingly, we have chosen not to proceed as originally planned and allow the Board of Education the opportunity to review the needs of all involved, and address a situation for which the district has no current policy.

We believe Mount Horeb to be an accepting place for all children. Another reading will be conducted by Mount Horeb High Schools Straight and Gay Alliance on Wednesday, according to the Journal.

UPDATE (Friday, Dec. 4): More than 600 people, including I Am Jazz author Jessica Herthel, attended the Mount Horeb library for a reading of the book on Wednesday afternoon. I think its a barometer of where were at as a society, Herthel told the Journal. I think were more ready to hear about this issue from a childs perspective, because we know a child isnt making a political statement or rebelling against society. Kids dont know not to tell the truth, and were getting more comfortable with that idea.  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Three may be a crowd but it can also be a whole lot of fun with the right approach. View this image  Congratulations! Youve been selected by a fabulous couple to share their bed/lives on an ongoing basis! Youre not out for a threesome fling youre in this for the medium to long haul. View this image  Its likely (but not guaranteed) that the couple in question will identify as polyamorous, meaning that they are able to feel nice sexual and/or emotional stuff for more than one person at a time. So while there will probably be a physical component to the relationship, being a couples third often means youll also go on dates and spend time with them in much the same way you would with an individual. Youll increase your chances of exciting conversation but decrease your chances of successfully splitting a main course. View this image  If you are dating a couple, its not cheating because everyone is aware and consenting to the arrangement. The normal (monogamous) rules dont apply. Also, youre agreeing to spend time with both partners. If youre only interested in one of them and theyve asked you to be their third, you should know right now that its probably not going to work out. View this image  Apologies if youre the a little more action type, but while a casual threesome can take place as soon as everyones consenting, a continuing relationship needs a lot of careful thought. You should always talk things out in advance, because if this is all going to end in disaster for one or more of you, itll probably be obvious from that first conversation. Make sure youre all compatible and equally enthusiastic. An unconventional setup brings its own challenges and complications, so this is an extremely important step. View this image  If youre being approached as a third, the implication is that the couple will remain primarily committed to each other, with you as an ongoing feature of their relationship. Over time, this can evolve into a triad situation, in which every party is equally committed to each other. But this is rarer and, if youre just starting out with this couple, its unlikely to be what theyre proposing. View this image  One youve all decided that youre in, the couple are likely to have a few rules about the way they want their relationship with you to work. If they dont, ask them to make some its the only way to be sure no ones overstepping boundaries. Do they want to keep the relationship on the down low? Do they want it to be mostly about sex with very little cooking pasta together domestic bliss? Do they never want to travel to your house? Find out! And if you agree to these rules, FOLLOW THEM. View this image  Theres no point going into this if youre not going to enjoy it. Figure out what youll want and need from them and be upfront about it. Hate sleeping over and doing the breakfast thing? Let them know. Need a lot of affirmation and text-y affection? Speak now or get quietly sad, really fast. Whether youre looking for casual fun or actual inclusion in their lives, you need to establish your expectations early. View this image  Are you also polyamorous? Can you happily fall in love with more than one person? Do you want to? If this couple is keen to get emotionally intimate, you need to know if thats something you can handle. And what if they want to see people other than you? Will you feel OK about that? Sure, sometimes you wont know until you try it, but if the idea of having serious feelings for multiple people causes a panic attack, emphasise that you need to keep this light and fun. View this image  One of the best things about any relationship is experimentation and having your horizons expanded. So theres a chance this couple will teach you some new, fun tricks. But if there are certain items that are permanently off your menu, let them know. Similarly, if theres a fantasy of yours that can only be fulfilled with two people present, nows your chance to make that happen (well, ask politely for that to happen). View this image  Once the business side of things is over and the ~business~ side can begin, make sure to be a giving and thoughtful lover. Inviting someone into your bed is an act of trust, so do your best to honour that trust. One of the beautiful things about being close to an existing couple is that they will have established patterns; integrate yourself into them as organically as you can. View this image  This is a rule for dating anyone, ever, but its particularly important in this case as you know, with absolute certainty, that multiple sexual partners are involved. Always use protection and make sure they do, too. View this image  Have the couple youre seeing told you they want you to move in or that theyd like to spend every waking second with you? If so, good for you! Those must be some moves. If not, give them space to just be a couple when they want it. Asking a third person to get involved doesnt mean you want to compromise the emotional sanctity of the primary relationship. Respect their commitment to each other. View this image  Look, one day we may all live in a sexually liberated utopia where people can bring however many partners as they like to a party (though not to a wedding, those things are expensive). But for now, you need to accept that you might not be invited to your significant others family events. If you think the sight of them in a Facebook photo, cuddling up over plates of turkey at one of their siblings flats will cause you distress, this scenario is possibly not for you. View this image  Unless its expressly part of your arrangement, do not have solo hang-out time with one half of the couple. Dating an open couple is different from dating an individual person in an open relationship. If this is how theyve chosen to structure things, theres probably good reasons for it. View this image  When a couple is having problems or arguing a lot, its very easy for the people around them to get dragged into that emotional whirlpool. Its even easier if those people are useful pawns in the making my partner jealous game (which is a terrible game, dont try this at home kids). Resist this kind of problem by explaining that you wont take sides (and dump them if it becomes a pattern). View this image  Unless youre an incredibly private person, youll probably want to discuss your relationship with loved ones at some point. If youre scared to tell your friends about it, ask yourself why. Are you ashamed? Or do you not trust them to understand? The best way to bring around doubters is to show them how happy you are and to explain that youve thought this through. That being said, all bets are off when it comes to telling your parents, especially if theyre the BUT WHEN ARE THE BABIES ARRIVING? types. Proceed with caution. View this image  Unless monogamy between the three of you is part of the relationship unless youre entering into a full triad situation where youre all equally committed it can be emotionally useful to keep seeing other people. Dating without full commitment is a lot of fun, but it can wear on you after a while. You might need some reminding that, should this not work out, there are other people out there for you. View this image  Unless you enjoy being an agent of chaos in other peoples lives, do not attempt to break up with one member of the couple and keep seeing the other. You all went into this together, you need to finish it together too. Theres a chance that you will end up connecting more to one half of the couple than the other but if thats the case, you need to get out of there even more urgently. Remember: their relationship with each other preceded their relationship with you and you are violating their trust by attempting to destroy it. View this image  If you want the terms of the relationship to change, or if something is bothering you, speak up and make sure both partners hear it. Just because things seemed fine to begin with doesnt mean theyll always be that way and you dont need to accept anything youre not enjoying. If this is your first time dating a couple, you may only become aware of certain issues over time. You may feel less powerful to act because theyre a team. But if theyre good people, they will make sure you feel heard. View this image  When it comes down to it, dating a couple is a wonderful experience. You get to know two people really well, youre invited into an existing intimate space, and you can often get more genders for the price of one (if thats your jam).

aS"Carol star Cate Blanchett and films director, Todd Haynes, talked to BuzzFeed News about the movies bold final act. Spoilers start right away! View this image  Cate Blanchett in Carol, with Rooney Mara. The Weinstein Company With few exceptions, fictional narratives about the lives of LGBT Americans in the pre-Stonewall era were largely stories of self-hatred, punishment, pathology and even death. They were also often enshrouded in subtext in order to obscure their queerness under layers of plausible deniability. The novelist Patricia Highsmith certainly and artfully engaged in those tropes, most famously in her homoerotic thrillers Strangers on a Train and The Talented Mr. Ripley. But in her 1952 novel The Price of Salt which has been adapted by director Todd Haynes and screenwriter Phyllis Nagy into the movie Carol, currently in theaters the books central love story between two women has a surprisingly hopeful ending. Its very T.S. Eliot in my end is my beginning, said Cate Blanchett, the eponymous star of Carol, in a phone interview, referencing Eliots 1940 poem East Coker. It ends with possibility, which is all any love affair can begin with: possibility. Carol tells the story of Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara), a slightly lost, but also very young, aspiring photographer in New York City, who takes a job at a department store for the Christmas holiday. There, she meets Carol Aird (Blanchett), a customer who appears to be an upper-class wife and mother from New Jersey. Therese, smitten immediately, grasps onto their almost imperceptible flirtation in order to get to see Carol again and it works. After an intense, largely unspoken and certainly brief courtship, the two women embark on an unlikely Christmas road trip. Therese will do anything Carol asks. And Carol, embroiled in an ugly divorce from her husband, Harge (Kyle Chandler), yearns to be anywhere but her empty house. View this image  The Weinstein Company As they travel, Carol sometimes succeeds in distracting herself into a low-boil of happiness, and Therese manages to get closer to Carol. But any incipient romance between them is thwarted after the first time they have sex: Harge has hired a private investigator to follow them, and by spying on them in bed, he now has the damning evidence to invoke a morality clause in their divorce to take custody of their daughter, Rindy (Sadie and KK Heim). Panicked and angered, Carol rushes home, leaving Therese in the care of Carols best friend and former girlfriend, Abby (Sarah Paulson). In a goodbye letter to Therese, Carol writes beautifully about a seemingly impossible future between them: lives stretched out ahead of us a perpetual sunrise, but until then, there must be no contact between us. She tells Therese, I release you. Therese is so devastated that she vomits on the side of the road. It seems, in other words, as if Carol is heading straight into tragedy the familiar territory of impossible love between two people of the same sex. But Highsmiths novel upended that expectation, and Haynes movie thrillingly follows suit. View this image  The Weinstein Company / Via queencate.tumblr.com The screenplay does diverge from the book in its framing: Carols first scene follows a young man into the bar at the Ritz Hotel, and as he settles in, he recognizes Therese from a distance and goes to say hello. Its then that we first see Therese and Carol together and they seem to be having a fraught, sad, and then interrupted exchange. When Therese leaves to accompany the man to a party theyre both attending, she stares out the window of a cab and remembers how her relationship with Carol began. The story of their relationship unfolds, eventually circling back so the audience can finally hear their conversation at the Ritz. In a recent interview with BuzzFeed News, Haynes said that when he first read Nagys screenplay, he thought of David Leans classic 1945 film Brief Encounter, and he worked with Nagy to emulate its structure. Brief Encounter begins with peripheral characters introducing you to its setting, with its main characters in the background the story is then told in flashback. Its not a whodunnit, but a who owns it kind of question, Haynes said. And I thought thats what makes love stories really resonant. Blanchett, who had been attached to Carol before Haynes signed on to direct it, said that the screenplays new configuration excited her, since Brief Encounter is one of her favorite films. Blanchett said, I felt like it released the screenplay into a completely different place. Thereses point of view takes the reader through The Price of Salt. But Carols gaze shifts throughout the movie, from being first Thereses version of events to later including Carols narrative. When Carol returns home knowing she could now lose Rindy, she is almost willing to sacrifice herself in order to prevent that. During a painful dinner with Harges family, they ask her about the psychotherapy she is undergoing, and she says its helping, even as she can barely contain her fury. Later, she talks to Abby about her misery especially since shes still without Rindy. When Abby brings up Therese, telling Carol that she has started a job in the photo department at the New York Times, Carol says, I should have said, Therese wait. Haynes said that by that time in the story, Carol is about to realize that it will be impossible for her to be both a full-time mother and someone who is happy. Shes trying really hard to keep her relationship with her daughter as the primary definer of who she is and what she wants, he said. And I think shes learning that she may need more than that. She cant cut off whole limbs to protect other people who are ultimately separate people from herself. View this image  Wilson Webb / The Weinstein Company As Carol heads in a taxicab to her lawyers office for what will surely be a brutal, humiliating showdown with Harge and one in which she might well capitulate she sees Therese walking down the street, looking purposeful and matured. Just the sight of Therese galvanizes Carol. She goes into emotional free-fall because shes trying to salvage her connection with her daughter, Blanchett said. But at such a cost that I think if she hadnt returned to Therese, she may well have killed herself. In the next scene, Carol interrupts the ugly fighting between her lawyer and Harge. Speaking directly to Harge, she says, I wont deny the truth, adding, Now what happened with Therese I wanted. And I will not deny it, or say that I do. She then shocks him by saying that she is willing to give him custody of Rindy as long as she can have regular visits with her. Now there was a time when I would have done almost anything I would have locked myself away to keep Rindy with me, Carol says. What use am I to her, to us, if Im living against my own grain? So thats the deal. I wont I cannot negotiate anymore. You take it or leave it. But if you leave it, we go to court. And if we go to court, it will get ugly. And were not ugly people, Harge! And with that, Carol walks out of the office. By that point, she does know who she loves, and thats what helps her to make that speech, Haynes said. Theres a strength of clarity that comes in that final scene. He added: Carol realizes shes sacrificing everything, and she needs to think about her needs as well. Therese was much more fundamental to what she wants than she maybe ever knew. Blanchett said, I think that in order to deeply love someone, you have to be free. View this image  Rooney Mara The Weinstein Company And so Carol returns to the bar at the Ritz a meeting initiated by Carol to Carol and Thereses conversation. Therese, guarded to the point of nearly being entombed, listens to Carol, but will not be vulnerable again. Carol, with a light tone, reports that she and Harge are selling their house, and that she has gotten an apartment and a job. When Therese asks about Rindy, Carol says that she has not seen her much her entreaty to Harge did not work (or has not yet worked, perhaps). The apartments a nice big one big enough for two, Carol tells Therese. I was hoping you might want to come live with me but I guess you wont. There is a long, loaded pause. Then: Would you? Carol asks, near desperation. Thereses response is careful: Oh, I dont think so. Carol is not entirely thwarted she knows she has hurt Therese deeply and she invites Therese to meet her at dinner with friends later at the Oak Room at the Plaza Hotel. Then she throws her Hail Mary, punctuating a stilted conversation filled with more silence and stares and exhalations than dialogue: I love you. Its then that Thereses acquaintance comes up to the table, not noticing Therese has been emotionally floored by Carols declaration. Carol is sure she has been rejected. But she has been performing a role her whole life and is able to put on a friendly face and leave the table. Its now Carol who is the one with her heart on her sleeve, who is sort of stripped naked and asking something of Therese, Haynes said of the scene. And Blanchett made note of Maras path for Therese: Its so beautiful the way Rooney has charted Thereses journey from innocence to maturity to heartbreak. I think its exquisite. If it seems like Carol will end there, having completed a sad circle, the film has another twist. Therese goes to her party filled with lively peers who call her by her last name, and to whom she can joke, Thered better be beer up there but she is distracted. And not even another woman who seems interested in her, played by Carrie Brownstein, can draw her attention. She leaves. View this image  The Weinstein Company In Carols final scene, Therese determinedly enters the Oak Room, searching for Carol. But when she sees her, Haynes said, theres a moment before she starts to move that I think is really important. He talked to Mara about the end of The Graduate after Benjamin rescues Elaine when they both wonder what will come next. Theyre in the bus, Haynes said. And then theyre just sitting in the bus. Like, Now what? I just wanted that little moment of Now what? Whats going to happen next? The walk across the room isnt the end of the story. With Therese contemplating her choice, the din of conversation in the crowded restaurant fades, and Carter Burwells score begins to play. Therese, now resolved again, starts her approach to Carols table, where Carol and her three friends appear to be having a lovely time. In a shot that Blanchett said tested her sense of peripheral vision to work out where the camera was, Carol finally notices Therese. The two women look at each other. Therese begins to smile; Carol, staring straight into the camera (we are Therese at that moment), looks exuberant. The music cuts off, the screen goes black, and the movie ends. (From the time Therese enters the restaurant until the final shot is a full two minutes.)

aS"The ruling upholds the will of Jerusalem activist May Peleg, who made arrangements before her suicide to be cremated to prevent her parents from seizing control of her body.  Facebook: peleg.may / Via Facebook: peleg.may Israels Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a suit from the family of a transgender activist that was challenging instructions in her will that she be cremated. May Peleg, who was chair of the Jerusalem LGBT organization Open House, killed herself earlier this month, following a sexual assault, a battle with her ex-wife over contact with her children, and long struggles with physical and mental illnesses, her friends told The Forward. Peleg, who was 31, had long been concerned about a battle with her ultra-orthodox family after her death. Their beliefs forbid cremation, and she worried they would attempt to have a religious burial under her male name. Peleg paid for her own cremation in March 2014 at the one funeral home in Jerusalem that performs the service, and filed a will with an attorney a day before her suicide and asked that he fight for her wishes if her family attempted to interfere. Since I have no contact with my biological family and since I fear that after my death there will be those who try to obstruct my final wish to be cremated, using various arguments, I ask you to represent me in court and be my voice, she wrote to attorney Yossi Wolfson, according to Haaretz. Pelegs fears were born out. In court filings identifying Peleg as her son, Pelegs mother sought to have the will voided, claiming Peleg was not in her right mind when she wrote it. Im from an Orthodox family and my sons burial is very important to me, the mother wrote, according to Haaretz. I ask that his body not be cremated or transferred to any agency wishing to do so. I ask to be given the body for burial according to Jewish law. After a lower court rejected her petition, the mother appealed to the Supreme Court, which upheld the lower courts decision. The Basic Law on Human Dignity and Liberty puts the wishes of the deceased at center stage, the court wrote. Judge Anat Baron added in an individual opinion, We do not come to judge the wishes and the way of May Peleg, but only to honor them. May her memory be blessed.

aS"Its a match is a fitting way to put it, since the couple originally met on Tinder. View this image  The printed card was fitting, considering the couple originally met on Tinder. A few dates [after meeting] we were talking about how long it takes to get a kidney in New York, and I learned we shared a blood type and decided to get tested, Interlicchio told BuzzFeed News. We didnt actually start officially dating until she was helping me fill out my donor history information to get tested. I got embarrassed because she saw that I put girlfriend as my relationship to the recipient, but she happily agreed to be my girlfriend. Interlicchio decided to not tell Duran the good news right away after she received the phone call informing her they had a match. I made a million and one excuses for why I hadnt found out the results yet, and I proceeded to have all of the other tests done secretly, Interlicchio said. Those other tests included a CAT scan, lab work, and a complete physical. Facebook: alana.duran.thatscool Facebook: alana.duran.thatscool She said that her heart was racing as Duran slowly made her way through the box. I wanted her to hurry up and get to the bottom, but she was so appreciative of every single item I bought, she said. She talked about the Star Wars bandaids for like 20 seconds. Duran said she had no clue what was about to happen. I really just thought it was a nice, thoughtful gesture, she said, and I was really enjoying seeing what was inside and loving the candy and knick-knacks she put in for me. Facebook: lori.interlicchio Facebook: lori.interlicchio Alana Duran Alana Duran It was really unbelievable and rather shocking that this woman in front of me, a perfect stranger I had met on Tinder, someone I love, was a match for me in more ways than one, she said. Facebook: alana.duran.thatscool Facebook: alana.duran.thatscool As most of you know I was diagnosed with Lupus at the age of 12. Lupus is an autoimmune disease where my bodys immune system is overactive and it starts to attack different parts of my body; thinking that my body is a foreign invader. In my case my Lupus was very active when I was younger resulting in a hip replacement, going into congestive heart failure, getting a pacemaker implanted, going into kidney failure and ultimately going on dialysis. Ive been waiting patiently for a kidney since 2011. Its been 4 years and no luck yet UNTIL a little while back my wonderfully amazing girlfriend Lori Interlicchio went and got tested to see if she was a match to donate a kidney to me. It turns out she is! Who knew that when we both swiped right on Tinder that day, that we would be more than just girlfriends but that she would be my kidney donor! Its so funny how things work out. Both of us going into this relationship not expecting anything out of the ordinary. Its just so amazing to me that she was willing to get tested and now shes super excited to donate one of her kidneys to me. Lori, I love you so much and Im so excited that we get to do this together. Youre the absolute best. View this image  But, it pains me to know that if we were a couple of gay men, my kidney would be considered at risk, she added.

aS"This state was the first to decriminalise homosexuality, but now has the most restrictive same-sex parenting laws in the country. View this image  Eli, 6, with his mum Katherine. Lane Sainty / BuzzFeed News Eli Taylor wants to be a soccer star. Hes pretty happy with life on this sunny Saturday morning, armed with a single scoop of rainbow ice cream and sandwiched between his two mums outside a bustling Italian cafe. Hell join a local Adelaide team soon, Eli tells me, but the dream is to join Chelsea FC one day. Its a grand objective for a six-year-old, and he delivers it with a cheeky grin. Elis sister Jasmine, 11, sits across from him. She opts for a milkshake instead, and studiously plays on an iPad while her mums, Katherine and Sharon, talk. She interjects occasionally, screwing up her nose when they mention homework. The Taylors have a happy home in Norwood, Adelaides east, complete with two mums, two kids, three cats, and a dog. Katherine and Sharon are public servants, Eli and Jasmine go to school. Theres Little Athletics on Sundays, and the weekly whirlwind of pick-ups, drop-offs, homework, and meals. In every respect, they are an ordinary family. But due to a quirk of South Australian law, Eli can have both his mums on his birth certificate, while Jasmine can only have Sharon. Norwood is the same suburb where Don Dunstan, the former premier of South Australia, grew old with his partner Steven Cheng. It was 40 years ago that South Australia became the first state in the country to decriminalise sex between men, with Dunstan at the helm. But since that initial great leap forward, the state has fallen behind. In particular, South Australia stands out when you look at same-sex parenting. Its possible to have kids if youre a same-sex couple in the state but there are bureaucratic barriers at every turn. If a Victorian bill receives the expected stamp of approval in mid-December, South Australia will be one of three jurisdictions in the country that doesnt allow same-sex adoption. Singles cant adopt either, or same-sex stepparents. A bill allowing same-sex couples to access altruistic surrogacy in South Australia has been passed, but not enacted, so the practice remains illegal. These barriers alone put the state in the behind category, not to mention wiping out in-state opportunities for gay male couples to have kids. However, two anomalies of South Australian law throw difficulties into the paths of lesbian couples in particular. The first requires proof of medical infertility as opposed to the social infertility of same-sex couples in order to access IVF and other forms of artificial reproductive technology. The second the law that leaves Jasmine with only one legal parent dictates that lesbian couples who have a child using donor sperm can only have both their names on the birth certificate if they lived together for three of the four years prior to conception. This law captures a small number of families. But the frustration this small group feels at not being legally recognised as a family is palpable.  View this image  Elise (L), Tadgh and Sally. Lane Sainty / BuzzFeed News Elise Duffield, Sally Amazon and their 18-month-old son Tadgh make up one such family. For all practical purposes, and according to the federal government, Tadgh has two mums. But legally in South Australia, he has just one. The law as it currently stands doesnt put the rights of the child first, Sally tells BuzzFeed News. When they applied to have Sallys name placed on Tadghs birth certificate and got a rejection letter from Births, Deaths and Marriages (BDM) because they hadnt lived together for long enough, just accepting it lying down wasnt an option. I think at that point, most people would have gone Oh well, well just get one name on the birth certificate and live with it, says Elise. We just went, No, you have to change the law! View this image  Lane Sainty / BuzzFeed News Tadgh is playing in a sandpit in Adelaides central Victoria Square, where, later in the afternoon, hundreds will gather for the annual Adelaide pride parade. Hes adventurous, and surprisingly speedy; his mums take turns chasing down his regular breaks for freedom as they chat to BuzzFeed News. After doing some research, Elise and Sally discovered that technically the law did apply to heterosexual couples as well they were just less likely to have conceived using methods other than sex, and if a man and woman appeared on the form, they were never questioned. They took the information to authorities in the hope the laws would be scrapped, but the response they received took them by surprise. We went to the Human Rights Commission [with pro bono lawyers] and said If you do want this information, that all couples are biologically connected to their children or they need to have lived together for three years, then you have to ask everyone, says Sally. The commission agreed with them but instead of changing the law, Births, Deaths and Marriages changed their forms to catch heterosexual couples as well. We wanted them to realise that the law is ridiculous, and change it, says Elise. And instead theyve changed their forms. With strong support from Greens upper house MP Tammy Franks, Liberal MP David Pisoni and Labor MP Katrine Hildyard, a bill removing the three year clause recently passed the South Australian upper house, where it was sponsored by Franks. Its yet to pass the states lower house though, where it is sponsored by Pisoni and Hildyard, and is returning for debate on December 3. The main hold up, according to Sally and Elise, has been attorney general John Rau. They first wrote to Rau shortly after Tadgh was born in May 2014, says Elise, and he didnt reply for months. When the bill was debated in parliament, Rau brought up unexpected amendments and criticised the methods used by the parents agitating for change. He had the gall to stand up in parliament and say I really feel for the people in this situation but I think the way youve gone about it is wrong, says Elise. Youre the attorney general mate, we wrote to you 18 months ago. You could have done something about it, and chose not to. John Rau did not respond to a request for comment from BuzzFeed News. One of Raus amendments was to make the law non-retrospective, meaning Sally would never legally be recognised as Tadghs mother. But what may look like your regular bureaucratic nightmare can have some very real affects. If Elise and Tadgh went to hospital in a car crash and Elise wasnt able to sign forms, I cant. Im not connected to him, says Sally. Elises mother could, shes her next of kin. But I cant. The Taylors are in the same boat, but with an added concern. Theyre not close to Sharons family, and dont trust that Sharons relatives would automatically hand Jasmine over to Katherine if something awful were to happen. Sharons family, we dont have a lot to do with, Katherine says. If something was to happen to SharonShe trails off, and Sharon finishes the sentence for her: Theres no guarantee of what they will and wont do. View this image  Jasmine and her mother Sharon. Lane Sainty / BuzzFeed I wouldnt put it past certain people to at least try and pursue some kind of claim, Katherine explains. Im not fearful that Jasmine would ever be taken away, but if something happened to Sharon, having to go through that process is something wed like to avoid. We dont want to put her through that. Touch wood Katherine raps the table twice nothing like that will ever happen. But its all about protecting for the things you dont want to think about. For South Australian same-sex couples who use IVF, it can be an expensive, difficult path. Helen and Denise have been together for twelve and a half years. When they first decided to start a family, the plan was to do a home insemination, and just use an IVF clinic for sperm storage. Quickly finding out they werent eligible to use clinics in South Australia as they werent medically infertile, the couple opted to travel to Melbourne, where they discovered their donor had fertility issues and were advised to undergo the full IVF process. This meant adding flights and accommodation to the already-expensive treatment and brought up some medical issues, too. The first cycle that I did, the doctors were relying on information from scans I had had in Adelaide, some of which werent by IVF specialists, explains Helen. They werent too sure on what they were looking for. My first cycle, we only got two eggs and one wasnt as good. The doctor said if Id been in Melbourne she would have seen me halfway through and said we need to up the dosage, we need to change things to have a better success rate. So we had to do two fresh IVF cycles, which at that stage was $8000 for a fresh cycle. And it was surgery for Helen twice, as well, adds Denise. View this image  Helen, Annika, Denise and Claudia. Lane Sainty / BuzzFeed News But despite the difficulties of having kids, Helen and Denise couldnt be without them. Claudia and Annika are wrangling with a plate of wedges while we talk. First theyre too hot, then a flailing elbow is accidentally dipped in the accompanying sauce. This is well behaved, Helen says wryly. The difference between being medically infertile and socially infertile a phrase that makes all three couples interviewed wince and laugh is a line thats been badly drawn by the government, Denise says. We had medical infertility [in their donor] and it didnt count, she says. I think the assumption is that if youre a gay couple and you use IVF you want it to be anonymous, you dont want anything to do with the donor. But were involved with the donor, he sees the girls, his family is involved with the girls. Throughout the entire spiel, Claudia is saying Mum! Mum! at an increasing volume. Once Denise is finished, she turns to her. What is it, darling? At playgroup today there was a dead bird. Thank you, honey, Denise says. Thank you for telling me that. At the very same playgroup that bird met its demise, same-sex couples often lament South Australias restrictive laws. Quite often we complain about various laws in regards to IVF, birth certificates, all that stuff, says Denise. Its not stopping people like us from having children or raising children. Its just putting us to extra effort, and doctors to extra effort. Its not stopping us. Across South Australia, staff in IVF clinics, doctors surgeries and at BDM are largely sympathetic to same-sex couples. All couples interviewed by BuzzFeed News reported being widely accepted in their communities, schools and workplaces, too. So why is South Australia lagging behind other states on parenting reform? Well, politics. A 2010 parliamentary report from the Social Development Committee recommended reform on every facet of same-sex parenting same-sex adoption, altruistic surrogacy, restrictions on IVF and the three year catch in presumption of parentage. But the Labor government, in power since 2002, is reluctant to make votes on same-sex parenting government policy meaning bills for reform are left to be pushed through in limited private members time. They often dont make it to a vote. Thats because weve got the right of the Labor party who are conservative, religious, Christian, drive the whipping and decide what gets on the agenda in negotiation with the Liberals, Greens MLC Tammy Franks tells BuzzFeed News. The intricacies of bureaucracy lead to constant misunderstandings as well. Many politicians are not particularly well versed in LGBTI issues and policy, and trying to pass policy like this is tiring. Members find it difficult to debate these issues because they actually have to think for themselves and do their own research, says Franks. Theyre not told by their party, given a briefing by their party on the pros and cons necessarily. Sometimes they are. Sometimes a member will go and brief their party room on it, but only an active member will do that.All of that work to brief people and then actually get it debated thats why things just dont get through our lower house that in any way have to do with sexuality. View this image  Lane Sainty / BuzzFeed News To combat the legally disjointed nature of their family, the Taylors made an unusual choice in 2009, just before Eli was born: they changed all of their surnames. Jasmine had a massive hyphenated name, Sharon explains. And Sharon had gone through her whole life spelling her [surname] out. There were variations of mine too, says Katherine. They thought about it, spoke to then five-year-old Jasmine, and then just chose one. A new, simpler name. Taylor, says Katherine. Just the normal way. Given our attachment to our surnames and the ongoing debate among heterosexual couples as to who should take whos name the Taylors choice might be seen as unusual. But, Katherine explains, when theres legislation keeping your family apart, something like having the same name can be a unifying, even calming, factor. To be brutally honest, I think thats been one of the biggest things thats given us an identity of family within the community, she says. Weve all got the same name. When it comes to schooling, filling out forms, going to sporting things. Its just sucky that it comes at a cost, says Sharon. Yeah, it cost us 600 bucks. Five billion dollars! yells Eli with glee. Hes chided gently with a relax, dude from Katherine. Jasmine is tapping away on the iPad. So thats when you became the Taylors? Yep, says Sharon. Here we come.

aS"Truvada prevents HIV, but only 21,000 people are taking the once-a-day pill. On Tuesday, federal health experts said that if we really want to stop the AIDS epidemic, that number should be more than 1.2 million. View this image  Jeff Chiu / AP / Via apimages.com A report released on Tuesday by the CDC finds that roughly 1.2 million people should be taking Truvada, the drug that prevents HIV. Thats about 60 times higher than current estimates, which suggest about 21,000 people take the drug. When taken consistently, the one-a-day blue pill also known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP reduces sexual transmission of HIV by roughly 92%, the agency said. In injectable drug users, it reduces the risk by more than 70%. By looking at the sexual risk profiles for different groups in the U.S., the CDC determined that 1 in 4 gay and bisexual men, 1 in 5 injectable drug users, and 1 in 200 heterosexual adults should be counseled about PrEP. About 1.2 million Americans are HIV positive, and new HIV infections in the U.S. hover at around 50,000 per year. Of those, only 30% are on the antiretroviral drugs that can suppress the level of virus in their blood to greatly decrease the likelihood of transmission. Theres a large gap in the number of people who are accessing PrEP currently, Jonathan Mermin, director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, told BuzzFeed News. But we think the demand for PrEP has reached somewhat of a tipping point. View this image   Truvada was approved by the FDA only in 2012. Since then, Mermin said, the main push has been to answer the question Is the science convincing enough? Several independent studies have made it absolutely clear that PrEP works and not just in clinical trials. In cities like San Francisco, Miami, and Washington, D.C., its been shown that when given the drug in community health care settings, most people will be good about taking it properly, and thus face a near-zero chance of contracting the virus. Other barriers remain, however. For example, a recent study showed that 34% of primary care practitioners had not heard of PrEP. And among communities at the highest risk for HIV, stigma and discrimination are huge barriers to receiving preventative care. In the U.S., for example, young black and Latino men are far less likely to be on PrEP than other groups, despite the fact that both populations are disproportionately affected by HIV. In 2010, the most recent year numbers were available, black Americans made up 44% of all new HIV infections, and Latinos 21%. Even in the gay community more broadly, PrEP has been stigmatized for supposedly promoting promiscuity. The social backdrop for PrEP has made barriers to receiving the preventative treatment far greater than a simple matter of health care access. The stigma and discrimination are huge, Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC, a global HIV-prevention advocacy group based in Harlem, told BuzzFeed News. Weve seen this for 35 years, delivering prevention and treatment is the hardest part. And the people who are hardest to reach are the ones who most need it. The CDC report emphasized that pushing education about the drug, both to patients and to health care providers, could help turn the tide. It cited New York state, where as part of Governor Andrew Cuomos End the Epidemic campaign, PrEP use by people covered by Medicaid increased from 303 prescriptions filed between 2013 and 2014, to 1,330 in this past year. PrEP is not just a pill you need a solid health care system, you need to promote it and educate, Warren said. The pill is just a part you need the whole ecosystem.

aS"Are you clean? Well, I wash. View this image  GMFA youtube.com The film, created by HIV charity GMFA, begins with one of the more common questions posed on gay dating apps: Are you clean? I wash, replied Thomas, 43. I shampoo, I condition, I exfoliate, I moisturise Im pretty clean, added Rhualdhri, 26, before a wealth of mostly nasty messages are read out. We wanted honest, instant reactions to the kind of stigma and sometimes abuse HIV-positive men can face on the gay dating scene, said GMFA, that is using the video with the hashtag #StopHIVStigma as part of a World Aids Day campaign. Their responses were funny, direct, and showed how HIV stigma can make them feel and how it should be dealt with. View this image  GMFA GMFA GMFA View this image  GMFA View this image  GMFA View this image  GMFA View this image  GMFA Greg said, Dating an HIV-positive, undetectable guy is the best way to make sure you stay negative. A recent major study revealed that when someone is HIV-positive and on medication so the levels of virus in their blood are suppressed to undetectable levels, they are effectively uninfectious. The researchers followed 1,110 couples, both gay and straight all of whom had unprotected sex and in over 44,000 sexual acts, not a single HIV-negative partner became infected. The subject of what people say to HIV-positive guys on apps has come up a lot among my friends, but I dont think people have taken it as seriously as they should, Rualdhri told BuzzFeed News. The things people say are ridiculous so the video brings some depth to what is quite a serious subject. He also revealed what reactions he has received on dating apps, You get asked, Are you clean? quite a lot, which really pisses me off. It doesnt make any sense and its degrading. Yet its become accepted on apps that thats the way we should talk to each other. Rualdhri continued: Id be more than happy to sit down with someone and explain the ins and outs of having HIV, but when theyre that blunt it makes me just think its a waste of time. As a result of such negativity, Rualdhri no longer uses dating apps. It got to the point where I would only talk to other positive guys because I knew that whole conversation wouldnt happen. Since coming off Grindr Ive regained self-worth and realised that those apps are not good for your mental health. But as well as encouraging people to educate themselves about HIV, Rualdhri also blamed the lack of education about the virus in schools. I didnt even learn about gay sex at school, he said. I think I heard about HIV once in biology. There needs to be more information given to young people, so theyre better educated to deal with the situations they find themselves in. View this image  Sadiq, 25. GMFA Last year, Sadiq revealed his HIV status on his Facebook page, for World Aids Day (1 December). Taking part in the video, he said, was about taking control back over my own diagnosis. It was a second coming out and so the video marks that and whats happened since then. He has experienced a really mixed response from men on dating apps, when he discloses his HIV status. Theres always some kind of reaction, he said.

aS"The Australian site aims to improve wellbeing among LGBTI people. View this image  Called TouchBase, the site is a joint initiative of the Victorian AIDS Council, the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations and the Australian Drug Foundation. TouchBase is intended to be a comprehensive resource where LGBTI people can find targeted information about a range of health and wellbeing factors. The information on the site is tailored specifically for LGBTI people, linking patterns of mental health, drug use, medication and sex in the community. Weve created TouchBase to address gaps in existing information for LGBTI people, said Victorian Aids Council CEO Simon Ruth. Its a unique website, because LGBTI people have different drug-using norms we use drugs in different patterns, we have different concerns, people have been dealing with different issues throughout their lives. View this image  Bill OLoughlin, president of Harm Reduction Victoria, said TouchBase would help ameliorate the stigma associated with drugs. Drug use is a part of life for many in our LGBTIQ community and its great that our organisations are helping us to talk about it in our own ways. We need to shift from the silence, secrecy, taboos and shame associated with drug use because it is harmful, he said. We need to know and talk about how to look after ourselves and others when we use drugs, for example how to use and inject safely, and how to look after those who might get into difficulty. View this image  Theres a focus on different interactions you may have with certain medications you might be on, whether thats HIV medications, or whether for some gender diverse or intersex people thats hormones. There are particular safety issues in both of those cases, said Ruth. As far as we know its the first website to tackle both drug interactions with HIV medications and drug interactions with hormones. Theres not a lot of information out there on drug interactions with hormones its something that were working to develop. Our community is incredibly resilient and knows how to have a good time but sometimes, the good time goes on a little too long, Holas said. Some of us still struggle with acceptance, loneliness, and other things that can create pathways to problematic use of alcohol and other drugs. The Institute of Many has also announced a new, community-specific resource today. Named Turning Tina, the harm-reduction resource is for gay, bisexual and transgender men with HIV who use crystal meth. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

Marsha is acting a as a sort of mentor to Sylvia. View this image  Commenting on the rich look of the film, Gossett notes: We wanted the movie to reflect Marshas beauty. She wasnt really fancy but she was fanciful, and when we talk about aesthetics its about the beauty of how she relates to other people. View this image  Wortzel adds: Frequently people expect that if a film is political its not going to be beautiful. It was really important for us to make a film that was deeply political and personal in many ways but also gorgeous to look at. View this image  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The European Commission has approved Genvoya, which trials show leads to reduced bone and kidney problems compared to current treatments. View this image  Gilead A new anti-HIV drug that could drastically reduce long-term side effects was given European Commission approval on Monday, allowing 28 countries in the EU to give it to HIV-positive patients. Although trials show Genvoya is similar or marginally superior in efficacy to the best existing treatments, HIV specialists say it is the reduced side effects, particularly bone and kidney problems, that are the most promising. Current anti-retroviral drugs become active in the bloodstream before reaching the infected CD4 cells the white blood cells that govern the immune system where they are needed. However, Genvoya, a single dose, once-daily regimen, only becomes active once it reaches the inside of CD4 cells. Because its more targeted in the place its needed, you dont have to give as big a dosage, Dr Tristan Barber, a consultant in HIV and sexual health at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, told BuzzFeed News. With previous drugs tenofivir for example a lot of it was removed [by the body] from the bloodstream before it had reached the target, so you had to give more of it to make sure you got enough to the target cells. Genvoya, which combines four different drugs (elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir) and received US approval earlier this month, contains a fraction of the dose of existing treatments, and a 10th of the previous dose of its central active ingredient, tenofovir. Tenofovir has been widely prescribed since 2001, and, like Genvoya, is owned by Gilead, the pharmaceutical company. In the long term, Barber said, such a reduction in dosage could offer significant safety benefits as slashed doses offer reductions in toxicity in particular by helping to reduce chronic bone and kidney problems. A 2009 study of HIV-positive patients across North America, China, and Europe found that between 1 in 11 and 1 in 20 suffered moderate to severe kidney problems. And in a small minority of patients, tenofovir can cause acute renal failure, as it is removed from the body through the kidneys. For the minority who suffer long-term, said Barber, this new drug clearly offers an advantage. View this image  Gilead Although the European Commission has given the drug the green light, following one of the largest phase 3 trials in HIV medication, Barber said it could be up to a year before patients in Britain can be prescribed it on the NHS as its cost-effectiveness still has to be demonstrated. The precise cost of the drug is yet to be revealed. Even then, not everyone who wants it will be prescribed it, Barber said. For people who have a definite need it would usually be approved, but for people who are not displaying signs of those toxicities it may be harder to make the case for them, he said. What people are starting to do now is adjust the very effective drugs we have to make them better over managing someone over 20 or 30 years. Its about slow and steady improvements to looking at the long-term management of HIV. This gives us a wider range of options for the long term. Anton Pozniak, the HIV service director at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, agreed, pointing out that although HIV-positive patients can now enjoy a similar life expectancy to anyone else, research shows they have an increased risk of secondary illnesses. Therefore, he added, with this product, we have an important new treatment option for a range of HIV patients as it offers both demonstrated sustained viral suppression and improvements in certain renal and bone safety markers compared to TDF [tenofovir]-based regimens. Patients already on existing treatments without problematic long-term side effects should not rush to change to Genvoya, however, said Barber. People do like the next new thing and there is definitely a role for this new drug, but its important for people who are stable on their current therapy without side effects to consider whether or not a switch is desirable for them. View this image  Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images Genvoya is also not currently advised for people who are co-infected with hepatitis C (HCV) or hepatitis B (HBV). But for people already suffering from kidney or bone problems, switching to the drug could lead to a real improvement in symptoms. And, as this week is National HIV Testing Week, Barber advised that the most important intervention remains early testing and early treatment.    Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"So, how about that Trump fella? View this image  This time of year, many of us will make a pilgrimage to see our families. Halls will be decked, candles will be lit, and ancient stories will be told. Hopefully everything for you will be hugs, warmth, light, and reconnection with the people you love. But if you are dreading dealing with that one jerk relative or bracing yourself for an onslaught of intrusive questions and and awkward topics, heres a guide to keeping your cool and choosing your battles when everyone around you is making it weird. View this image  If this is a happy and important time of year for you, this question is routine pleasant small talk. For people with dysfunctional families or people going through hard times not to mention the giant swath of the worlds population that celebrates their major holidays at other times of year this question registers somewhere between total non sequitur and Welp, thanks for the reminder. We who celebrate should celebrate, but we also need to make room in our celebrations for other peoples realities, even if that means making room for grief or pain.  I dont really celebrate, but tell me what you like to do.  Thats a painful subject just now, thanks for understanding. But tell me more about your celebration!  If someone badgers you for details, they are the ones who are out of line. Just repeat yourself. You had no way of knowing, but I really dont like to talk about it. Lets change the subject. Try to remember that most people are just making small talk and they probably dont want to upset you. Also remember that you dont owe anyone an uncomplicated life or a performance of happiness. If someone finds your holiday spirit inadequate, they are the ones making it awkward. And if you ask somebody about their plans and they dont seem excited to talk about it, take a cue from them and dont try to sell them on the season. Wish people well and let their feelings be what they are. View this image  Maybe some families can have constructive and respectful conversations about politics where eyes are opened and views are changed. If your family is like that, please a) ignore the following advice completely, and b) tell me all about it! Ive always imagined what that might be like! If your family is not like that, and if, like me, you have EXACTLY ZERO CHILL in discussing world events right now, I want you all to raise your glass to my beloved departed Grandma Louise as you say this with me: We have a secret ballot in this country for a reason, and we can all keep our secrets for one more [INSERT HOLIDAY] dinner. Grandpa Oscar was a walking Letter-To-The-Editor and was also one of the O.G.s of the Cranky Old Man Internet where misinformation and 1991 church bulletin layouts live on forever, immune to all fact-checking and advances in typography. Faithfully loving that dude for 60 years meant that Grandma developed some iron-clad boundaries about how much being talked at she was willing to put up with.  Im pretty sure we disagree on a lot of things, and I dont think this is the day that either of us changes our minds. But Im so glad to get to see you, and I really want to hear all about [MASSIVE SUBJECT CHANGE]! Hows that dissertation going?  Hrmmmmm. I really disagree/Im not sure thats the case/That seems like a topic for another day. Hey, Im gonna get another drink/visit the restroom/watch the little kids open presents.  Shamelessly deflect: You know I can talk about this stuff forever, but I promised Mom I would keep it cool today. Why dont you send me some of those articles you were mentioning and Ill send you some as well*.  Or use others as conversational shield: Oh look, [COOL RELATIVE WHO IS NOT BADGERING EVERYBODY] is here, I havent had a chance to say hello. Can I get you anything while Im up? Then get up and physically move to where Cool Relative is. *You do not have to read these articles and you can forget to send them articles as well. If youre dreading a day with Uncle Gun Rights Are The ONLY Rights, sometimes the best thing you can do for yourself is to make a list of all the people at the gathering that you DO want to see, make it a point to sit next to them, and find the other people in the room who roll their eyes at Seor Talks-A-Lot. A problem shared is a problem halved, as the proverb says. A jackass ignored is a jackass neutralized? Avoided? A jackass ignored makes your holiday better. View this image  Sometimes its best to change the subject, de-escalate, or otherwise gracefully extract yourself from conversations. But there will be occasions when you feel a responsibility to do better than lets just agree to disagree! Its one thing to avoid or try to redirect people who annoy and bully you, and another thing to pretend to agree with toxic people for the sake of keeping the peace. Whose peace are you keeping? And at what cost? In certain instances, its important to say an unambiguous I disagree not because youll necessarily change anyones mind, but to remind yourself whats real and true, to help you find the other people in the room who also disagree, and also because some opinions and views are poisonous and unacceptable and should not be washed away with Hrmmm, interesting idea, also these mashed potatoes are great. Them: [Offensive thing] Me: Wow, I really disagree. But lets talk about this Subject Change! Them: No, I want to keep talking about Offensive Thing. Have you heard about Completely Fact-Free Event Made Of Lies? Me: I have not heard about that, no. I still really disagree with your position, but Im happy to talk about Neutral Topic, or I have not heard about that, no. Please excuse me. If the person will not take the conversational lifeline I am sending them, or if they follow me out of the conversation to keep badgering me, my mandate to remain polite officially ends, and a different Captain Awkward comes out. Green. Strangely muscular. With shredded purple pants where my clothes used to be.  Let me stop you right there. We are done talking.  NOPE!  I hope youre not saying [offensive or inaccurate thing about a particular group of people] because you think I agree with you, because I do not. Now, if youll excuse me  I am leaving now, do not follow me.  Here are 101 facts that prove you are wrong recited from memory with full scholarly citations. Shall I continue? If I am the host of an event or am teaching, and Im therefore responsible not just for myself but for guests or students, I make ONE good faith attempt at Thats not true or Wow, how offensive before I say, Thats completely unacceptable. Change topics, be quiet, or leave. I do not use a quiet tone of voice, I do not make my body or posture small, and, if it gets to that point, I do not give a crap who overhears me or who thinks I am making a scene. Speaking up for yourself and the things you believe in the face of someone talking over you isnt ever going to be comfortable. But theres something to be said for exiting a conversation un-gracefully. View this image  American culture is super weird about eating and bodies on a normal day. During the holidays, a traditional time of feasting and togetherness, this weirdness can grow to epic, painful levels. I am personally on a mission to build a world where all bodies are good bodies and the chief properties of food are nourishing and tasty AF. But we currently dont live in that world.  Hrmm, interesting.  You dont say. Then throw out a subject change. For example: Aunt Food Police: Should you be eating that? It has ONE BILLION CALORIES!!! You: Mmmm, is that so. Hey, how is your project to scan and organize the family photos going, Auntie? Sometimes, especially with people you rarely see, victory doesnt necessarily lie in convincing the person that theyre wrong, but in conveying There is no way in heck I am talking to you about this and then letting their faux pas hang there.  Its really weird that you are monitoring my food.  Policing my food is really uncomfortable/inappropriate/rude.  How about I worry about whats on my plate and you worry about yours.  I save discussions about that for my doctor, not my relatives on holidays. The moment will be awkward, because commenting on your food choices is an awkward thing to do. Do your best to return the awkwardness to sender and find a much cooler person in the room to sit by. View this image  After a grueling and expensive journey where your fellow airline passengers definitely probably created entire new strains of the flu as they coughed directly into your open mouth, you arrive at your ancestral home. Before you can even finish hugging everyone and pour a glass of eggnog, your ancestors descend to dissect your appearance and life choices: I liked your old glasses better, or That coat looks like you slept in it, or the always delightful Would it kill you to shave/put some lipstick on/put on a hat/take off your hat? Comments like this used to take me straight back to feeling (and acting) like a surly teenager. Once I realized that it was a ritual, like a pack of wolves welcoming a pack member back with butt-sniffing and a wrestling match, it got easier. Its never a fun ritual, but the comments didnt mean you suck so much as you belong to us but you dont quite match what I remember in the language of repressed New England people who are terrible at feelings.  Huh.  Nice to see you, too.  Thanks for your opinion, Ill think about it. (Its true, I did think about their opinion for a few seconds before continuing not to care.)  I did sleep in this coat; airport floors are cold.  Wow. Use a strong, pointed tone and follow it with a really long, awkward pause.  Really?  Im confused. What is it that you want me to feel or do when you say something like that? If the conversation devolves from there into how sensitive you are and how you cant take a joke, strongly consider going back to the airport and taking the next flight out. Somewhere warm, somewhere people arent jerks to you. View this image  We tell people that they should ask questions in order to show interest in others, and overall, thats a good strategy, but there is a certain kind of catching up with family holiday chit-chat line of questioning that feels guaranteed to steer the conversation directly into the your most sensitive spots. If this happens to you, and you feel a pit of shame and anxiety start to open up under you, try to remember that most of the time your relatives just genuinely want to know whats new in your life. Even if the questions are coming with some crappy and judgmental subtext, youll feel better if you dont cry in front of bullies, and youll keep your poise better if you treat these questions like they are nice questions from nice people and leave the mean subtext unacknowledged.

aS"And their apartments were really, really cute. View this image  Three New York City couples agreed to provide photos of their digs and answer our prying questions about what its really like to cohabitate with your girlfriend the good, the bad, and the ugly. And no, this project had nothing to do with the fact my girlfriend and I are considering moving in together and Im freaking out about it. Nothing at all. How long did you date before you decided to move in together? How long have you been living together now? A: Weve lived together for a year, and we dated for about a year before we moved in together. How did your friends or family react?  A: I think my parents were really excited that we moved in together. My parents really love Beth and my dad is the kind of dad thats like, I want to know that youre being taken care of, and he could see that Beth would be really good at that. What were you most nervous or apprehensive about?  A: The only thing I was worried about was that, well Im clean, but Beth? View this image  A: She would be taking money off the rent for how much she cleans its amazing. Were you surprised by any unexpected challenges after moving in? Unexpected perks? B: I think an unexpected perk is that Ali brought this creative, calm energy into the space which I really enjoyed. A: Another perk is that you basically get to have the most baller sleepovers every single night. For us sometimes thats binge-watching Property Brothers and eating cookies. I love it so much. View this image  A: One concern that I did not expect until we moved in together is that I think theres an awareness when youre gay and youre two women I felt a vulnerability in that I want to protect myself and I especially want to protect Beth, but I know there are guys bigger and stronger than us. There was a period where there were no other occupants in the building except for us and it made me so nervous. At night it freaked me out. What if someone broke in and it was just me and Beth? How are we going to attack him or keep him away? That was something I wasnt prepared for. When you love someone so much and you are a protector, in the same way you would be in a male-female or male-male relationship, I just felt I dont know. I wanted to show up with the strength to protect us, protect Beth. A: Are you going to tell them what we did about it? We have protective measures. I guess we shouldnt tell them about the booby traps, just in case. B: Yes. Dont tell them about the booby traps. We have some weapons, one being a A: fully loaded flashlight. Im going to say its a chrome material? Its silver and it would definitely do some damage. Its got some double Ds up in there. View this image  B: You know what else we have? A bat. And its engraved with Alisons name on it. Which would be nice if you whacked someone maybe it would leave a branded mark with your name. A: Would add insult to injury, literally. We have them near the bed so if we are sleeping and someone comes in? You go for the bat and I go for the flashlight. B: Thats pretty good. Whats your favorite thing about living together? B: My favorite thing about living together is cooking meals together. We kind of brainstorm what we want and then we can cook together and eat together. A: And movie marathons. View this image  Advice to anyone about to ~merge~ with their significant other? B: I would say two things. First thing, just make sure you talk about everything before it happens rather than trying to adjust in the moment. I think also, just keep a sense of humor about it. Its all going to be fine. A: Beth had already lived here and I moved in, which was awesome. I think that something that was really helpful was Beth coming to me and being like, How do we make this space ours? How do we change things so this represents both of us? I felt like she initiated that conversation so it made me feel comfortable and I knew she wanted both of us to be active participants in this place. We did change some things; it was really nice. It felt like a nesting process and it felt like home. How long did you date before you decided to move in together? C: A year and a half? J: Yeah, I think so. It was a long time as far as lesbians go. How did your friends or family react? View this image  J: Yeah, I think anyone who was around us assumed we were around each other all the time. C: Which was actually true, it was just harder then. Lots of commuting time between Bushwick and Greenpoint. Sometimes we walked! Oh, youth. What were you most nervous or apprehensive about? C: I dont know. Nothing really? I wasnt really nervous about it. J: For me, I was most nervous about the actual space, finding the right apartment. But thats about just funding a good place in NYC, not about us. Jess Probus Were you surprised by any unexpected challenges after moving in? Unexpected perks? C: The perks is the decorating. Its not that my design skills are so bad, but its just nice to come home and see the whole living room looks different and really good. J: So you dont mind when you leave for two days and I just redecorate? Haha. Because Ive done that a lot. C: No, I love it. The only thing is when I cant find things. Im the type of crazy person that puts something down in a weird place and then expects it to still be in that place later. Like that hair dye, remember that? I was like, Have you seen that hair dye I bought? And you were like, Yeah, that was a year ago. Its been in the trash for months. What is your biggest pet peeve about the other (in terms of living in the same space? J: My biggest pet peeve is that we dont have the same shoe size so we cant share shoes. Because we have the same taste in shoes, but I cant fit my size 10 feet in your Size 7 desert boots. C: Mine is that you look better in my clothes when you borrow them. Can I say that? You put something on and then Im like, you should just keep that. J: To which I always say, we can just continue to keep it in the dresser we share. View this image  Whats your favorite thing about living together?  C: Yeah, this was part of it that we talked about being excited about even before we moved in: merging our tank top collection! J: Yeah, and our books. I remember when I first went to your house I noticed that we had some of the same books. And Im such a book hoarder that I was like, oh good, now well have two Amy Hempels! C: Just in case! J: We can keep one in each room we have bookshelves in! instagram.com Advice to anyone about to ~merge~ with their significant other? J: My advice is that, if its not already going well, then moving in together will definitely not help things. I know Ive made that mistake before. But with us, things were already going so well and the only sort of problems we had were related to not living together [laughs]. C: Yeah, oh man. If there are problems in your relationship, moving in together will definitely magnify those problems. Dont do it unless its already going well. View this image  instagram.com instagram.com S: We were dating for just about a year before we decided to move in together; both of our leases were about to be up and it just seemed to make sense. J: I was living with a cat and I did not want to. S: And weve been living together now for about four months? Jess guessed a year and that is wrong. How did your friends or family react? View this image  S: I feel like right before we moved in together, I dont think anyone was really very supportive of it. J: Really? S: Not because of you! Just the idea, in general, of moving in with a significant other is sort of taboo in New York. We were just at a year but we hadnt known each other for that long. J: What did they say!? S: It wasnt you, specifically. I feel like a lot of people I know think that you shouldnt move in with a significant other super soon, and they can be judge-y of that. That youre not being fun and cool and single, living in Bushwick with a million other people. J: But your parents thought that? Like your family thought that? Like your aunt? S: Yeah. She said we should wait. View this image  S: But shes a very old-school, traditional person. When I was asking for advice everyone was like, Yeah, maybe dont do that. You have your whole life to life with someone. Why not wait. And I was like, Yeah, Im going to do that. Now, though, theyre super supportive! J: No one really cared, for me. What were you most nervous or apprehensive about?  S: I was nervous it was going to negatively impact our relationship and that we werent going to like each other and we were going to break up. Worst case scenario! J: Yeah, me too. Im weird about clean things. I dont like walking around barefoot unless the floor has been swept. I have a lot of small things that I was afraid would be too much. And, Im bossy. S: I was worried about space because Im very much a person who likes to alone a lot, just in my own corner doing my own thing. I was afraid that we would be on top of each other and get sick of each other which is why we decided to move into a two-bedroom apartment. We use the second bedroom as an office that Jess has her guitars in, we have a big living room, bedroom. We have spaces to be by ourselves which alleviated a lot of my worries. J: Space is a big concern for me, too. Well, Id lived with someone before so I wasnt too concerned. S: I had never lived with someone I was dating before. J: Thats why I kind of knew I would be able to figure out personal space with you Ive already been in the situation where I didnt have that, and it was bad. It affected the relationship in a weird way. That was a turning point for me, and now I know how to give people space. Were you surprised by any unexpected challenges after moving in? Unexpected perks? View this image  S: Our biggest fight is about the dishes. J: Because you dont do them! S: I hate the dishes. Ill do them, but only if the division of labor is equal. I dont like doing just one more dish than I have to do. J: Were working on it. S: A dishwasher would solve all our problems. View this image  What is your favorite thing about living together?  J: Shannon cooks really well. She cooks great brussels sprouts. I eat healthier now. S: You can just go home but it feels like youre still being social because theres someone else at home! J: You always have someone to cuddle with. Thats the best part! You always have someone to cuddle with, always. S: Sharing clothes! Lesbian perks. We also basically have the same shoe size. My feet are a little bigger but I can force myself into your shoes. We make it work. J: I like sharing books with you. S: This is the first time in my adult life Ive had a full bookshelf a floor-to-ceiling bookshelf. I loved filling it with our combined collections. Advice to anyone about to ~merge~ with their significant other? J: See how well they do the dishes. S: Observe their dish patterns, but its not a total deal breaker. J: We are making it work! S: Really think about what habits you like having at home and think about how living with someone might infringe upon those habits. J: Make sure youre mature enough to have disagreements with someone and be able to talk it out. Just be a good roommate? First and foremost. Nothing is worse than living with an immature roommate, let alone a immature significant other. S: Before you can even support each other in a relationship sense, youve got to be able to clean up after yourself and be a respectful roommate. J: Do those dishes.

aS'On the eve of his starring role as pioneer trans woman Lili Elbe in The Danish Girl, Eddie Redmayne expounds on the complexity of gender: his own and everyone elses. Eddie Redmayne is not the type of movie star whose electricity courses through you the second he walks into a room or, in this case, the intimate courtyard of a downtown Manhattan hotel on an unseasonably warm fall day. Hes the type who drills into your consciousness with his large eyes the moment he courteously shakes your hand, with a smile that says, Were just two humans, you and I, except I happen to have an Oscar. In London, I still go on the Tube, Redmayne says when I ask him how becoming famous worldwide after the success of Les Misrables and The Theory of Everything has changed his life. Occasionally people stop and ask for photos, but they dont disrupt. Its hard to tell whether this is literally true or hes being protective of his fans. Whats more apparent is Redmaynes solicitousness, the gentlemanly way he opens the door for me as we move from the courtyard to an adjacent drawing room. The space is appointed in Edwardian-inspired burgundy and beige decor, a blend of patchwork-upholstered couches and floral plush chairs. Its appropriate for a conversation about a film set in the beginning of the last century. View this image  Redmayne in New York City on Nov. 7, 2015. Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News We move to a couch overstuffed with pillows, which Redmayne clears away so the two of us can talk over morning coffee. I lean forward to take a closer look at those eyes, which he deployed to great effect when playing a transgender woman in his upcoming movie The Danish Girl, a David Ebershoff novel adapted by Lucinda Coxon and directed by Tom Hooper, who directed Redmayne in Les Mis. That woman, the Danish painter Lili Elbe, was one of the first people to undergo gender reassignment surgery in 1930. Throughout multiple scenes in which Redmayne portrays Lilis various stages of self-recognition as she moves from fascination with womens clothes to a deep conviction in her womanhood Redmaynes eyes are filled with wonder and fear, ever on the verge of tears. In life and out of character, Redmaynes eyes communicate sincerity and an amiable readiness to do whats asked of him. He steadily drops his formality, relaxes his muscles, and settles into an even pose on the couch, both feet on the ground, hands cupped together on his lap. Theres a neutrality to Redmayne, the way his boyish build isnt overly masculine; his features shift back and forth between strength and delicacy. His ability to embody femininity allowed Hooper to envision him for The Danish Girl. I look like my mum, Redmayne admits without any hint of embarrassment. Ive played women since I was a kid and Ive always enjoyed it. Though he became a global movie star by playing straight men, as Marius in Les Mis in 2012 and in his Oscar-winning turn as Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything, a full catalog of Redmaynes roles reveals many gender-bending and queer parts. At his exclusive boarding school Eton in South East England, where he was in the same class as Prince William, Redmayne played fish-out-of-water ingenue Adela Quested as a teenager, in a stage adaptation of A Passage to India. He also played the bisexual, fishnet-wearing emcee in a 2001 production of Cabaret at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. So its not surprising that Redmayne also played a woman in his first professional role. While still an art history major in undergrad, he was handpicked by renowned theater actor and director Mark Rylance to play Viola in a traditional Elizabethan all-male Shakespeares Globe production of Twelfth Night in 2002. His performance immediately thrust Redmayne into the limelight as a bona fide actor. Independent critic Paul Taylor notoriously commented: I think that Eddie Redmayne (the undergraduate from Trinity College, Cambridge who is scandalously persuasive as Viola) would bring out the bisexual in any man. These witty, ironic turns may have given Redmayne some preparation to play Lili, but there are clear differences between her and his previous roles. One of the most searing moments in The Danish Girl occurs when a man who Lili believes is attracted to her as a woman suddenly calls her by her birth name, revealing that hes attracted to her as a man dressed in womens clothes. As Lili recoils from the mans arms, its at this moment that she discovers for herself how her commitment to being Lili extends beyond playing dress-up. Its the sort of realization that goes far beyond any of the gender-bending that Redmayne has explored before. The difference is trans experience, Redmayne emphasizes, and learning about it from trans people. To prepare for Lili, Redmayne relied in part on books and pictures. Apart from Ebershoffs novel, there was Elbes posthumously published memoir, Man Into Woman, which Redmayne examined for clues into her character. There were also photographs of Lili and paintings by her wife, Gerda Wegener, which he describes as super-stylized and quite mannered. But Redmayne also made sure to consult with living transgender women from various generations, to get both emotional and physical pointers on how to play the part. View this image  The Danish Girl. Focus Features Jumping up from the couch, Redmayne shows me how one of the women he consulted with would look in the mirror before leaving the house every morning and sling a backpack over one shoulder here he mimes putting on an invisible backpack, glances at me over his shoulder, and juts out his hip before testing her stance, to find curves that she didnt have in her body. This influence is evident in Redmaynes performance, as there are several scenes in The Danish Girl where Lili looks in mirrors in various outfits and stages of dress, trying to find her womanhood in her posture not as a form of imitation, but as a way of being. There were even times when Redmaynes research exposed divergences between The Danish Girls script and the lived experiences of trans women he heard from. What a lot of the women I met told me about were the disastrous failures of the first time they were going out [dressed in womens clothes], Redmayne confides, but the script demanded that an audience at moments and the public believe Lili instantly in her femininity. In the movie, Lili first discovers her fascination with womanhood when her wife, Gerda, asks her to stand in for a female model in one of Gerdas paintings. But as Lilis interest grows, she decides to find womens clothes for herself and go to a party with Gerda, who introduces her as her husbands cousin from out of town. Many of the men at the party are instantly fascinated with the beautiful yet shy woman, and there is no hint in the movie that anyone suspects Lili to be the same person as Gerdas husband. Redmayne indicates that he took steps to reflect trans experience more realistically with the movies makeup and hair artist Jan Sewell. I dont know what you think of the early stages of transition, of hyper-feminization or of trying too much makeup on, Redmayne says, politely acknowledging my experience as a trans woman, as he does throughout our interaction, but one of the things we came up with because I look nothing like Lili, or Lili when she was known as Einar working with Jan Sewell, the wig that she wears to begin with was quite strong. This overly theatrical flourish during Lilis first public appearance in womens clothes was how Redmayne was able to play Lili as being instantly convincing as a woman, while still reflecting the common experience of trans women taking time to figure out how to occupy their new gender roles. View this image  Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News This concern for passing the degree to which a trans woman can convincingly appear to others as cisgender in public is a substantial and complicated one for Redmayne, which reflects his discussions with the trans women he consulted. He describes what a trans woman told him about how passing creates divisions among trans women. She would be with a friend of hers who does not blend at all, Redmayne says, and she would get worried about her association even though she hated herself for feeling that. Yet its also clear as Redmayne and I continue to talk that his concern does not just have to do with the trans women he met, or whether The Danish Girl accurately reflects trans experience. Its also his own self-consciousness about being believable as Lili, both in the movie and in life (he interacted with the film crew in womens clothes, and tabloid pictures were taken of him while on set). One of the things that I felt constantly scrutinized by was, am I passing? And then I was also constantly frustrated with that term because its not about in some ways it was maybe to begin about [Lilis] passing in some ways, but then I hope by the end its not, its just about her being who she is, Redmayne says, overlapping his own feelings with those of the character he plays. I certainly felt the scrutiny and judgment of the people around me about how I was looking. Its hard to tell whether this self-consciousness is about Redmayne wanting to create a convincing performance as an actor, or not fucking it up when it comes to convincingly and accurately portraying a trans womans experience. The two goals are perhaps one and the same. When I ask about his own relationship to gender, Redmayne is noncommittal. If gender is on a spectrum, where one finds oneself is completely unique, he says, shifting back and forth between thoughtfully putting a hand on his chin and gesturing in explanation. I also think it is wherever we are born that you are influenced by where you are, [and by] what your circumstances are as well. So I think its very difficult to know, also particularly as an actor, when your job is to go into different versions of gender. He cites the range of his roles, from Viola to the World War I soldier Stephen Wraysford in the 2012 BBC miniseries Birdsong, who Redmayne describes as a very broken but very male figure. So whats interesting is that you dont really know about your ownthe specifics of your own. Regardless of specifics, he presents himself to the world as a thirtysomething male actor whos married to a woman, public relations executive Hannah Bagshawe, and lives in London. I ask him whether hell ever play someone more like himself. I dont know if Id be very good at it, he demurs, then explains that part of what allows him to act effectively is creating a separation between his own nervous self and the character hes playing. Theres something scary about acting always, because basically you do all this work in a vacuum and then suddenly theres a lot of money spent making a film and theres suddenly a camera here! Redmayne thrusts out his palm and stops a couple of inches from my face Going, right? What are you gonna do? View this image  Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Impulsively, I ask him if I can see his right hand after he pulls it back into his lap. He presents it to me, and I take it with my left hand, briefly feeling his surprisingly soft palm with my fingers. Then I move my hand from under his and put his palm against mine, so that our hands are mirror images of each other. People often tell me I have unusually small hands, but Redmaynes hand is not much bigger, his fingers thin and delicate. I explain that trans women often compare hands early in transition, to see whether they can pass easily as cisgender. Its the biggest tell, I say. Hands and feet. Really? Hands and feet, he replies pensively. Redmayne continues to talk about the trans women he met in preparation for the role how open they were, what he learned from them, and how he incorporated lessons into his part. Every single woman I met, bar none, would pretty much start the conversation going, There is no question Im not willing to answer, in an attempt to educate me, he says. The idea of upsetting them or not doing a good enough job is the thing that has fueled the work that I did. Yet there is also a significant faction of the transgender community that bristles over how, once again, a cisgender man is playing a trans character in a big, Oscar-courting movie. This tradition has a long history dating back to Jaye Davidsons Oscar-nominated performance in The Crying Game, to Hilary Swank in Boys Dont Cry and Jared Leto in Dallas Buyers Club. Many trans leaders and activists are calling for these plum roles to go to transgender people, who are becoming increasingly present in Hollywood. Theres been a huge history of cisgender success on the back of trans stories, which is something Im deeply aware of, Redmayne says. My take on it, I suppose, was that I do think actors should be able to play anything. He cites the casting of transgender actress Rebecca Root in the small part of Lilis nurse in The Danish Girl as a small example of progress. But at the same point, Redmayne continues, I also realize there are so few trans parts and so many brilliant trans actors and actresses that I understand [the backlash] not only understand it, but absolutely see the anger. Redmayne envisions a future where more compelling trans stories will be told by trans people, both in front of and behind the camera. He cites the upcoming Jen Richardspenned web series Her Story which stars Richards and another trans actress, Angelica Ross as a promising example of trans lives depicted onscreen by trans people. Ive got to say I think shes pretty extraordinary, Redmayne says of Richards. It is a tipping point and it is changing. He also cites the importance of training as a means for trans people to gain more chances to play both cis and trans roles. There is a course in London, which I went to, for trans people being trained, and its a grassroots thing, he says. Its not only giving people enough opportunity but also encouraging people to train. But some trans people arent only concerned with the lack of professional opportunities for trans actors they also fear that an ignorant public will equate trans women with men dressed in drag if they keep seeing cisgender actors playing these roles. Contemplating this concern, Redmaynes mood turns solemn. I just hope we get to a point in the world in which the acknowledgement that wherever you are on the spectrum and whoever you want to be is validity enough, he says, that one doesnt have to look a certain way or pass in any sense of the word. Redmayne continues: Theres no way that [The Danish Girl], this performance, is ever going to please everyone; thats the nature, I suppose, of what we do. I do just hope within a political sphere, if it continues this conversation, and I mean that conversation and debate and dialogue, and forces people to understand and educate themselves, particularly in the cisgender community, enough to be able to have a point of view then thats, I hope, only a good thing.

aS"Carol, starring Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, is a luxurious lesbian period film so luxurious, in fact, that the women can seem like beautiful symbols just beyond our reach. View this image  The Weinstein Company Theres a scene in Carol, Todd Haynes sumptuous new lesbian drama, when the films heroines finally, at long last, touch. Following many little moments a squeezed shoulder, a brushed hand this scene is the long-awaited apogee. Carol Aird, played with usual exquisiteness by Cate Blanchett, is the archetypal Older Woman, on the run from a husband denying her visitation with her daughter; Rooney Maras Therese is the Younger, a wide-eyed and short-banged shopgirl aspiring to the photography big leagues. In a cramped hotel room, Carol leans over Therese, whos splayed before her on the bed, and removes Thereses clothes. The camera affords us Carols eager perspective: We see a swath of Thereses exposed and lamplit skin. Before leaning down to kiss her, Carol takes a breath. I never looked like that, she says. And for this viewer, at least Carols panted observation momentarily broke the films spell. An Older/Younger lesbian storyline can potentially shoehorn both women into mere foils of one another: two distinct symbols of Womanhood at different stages of life, yearning for the trappings of the others lifestyle rather than flat-out yearning for the other woman herself. In another gay lady film this awards season, Freeheld, the two main characters also have a significant age difference. While its wonderful to see depictions of these kinds of relationships theyre quite common offscreen, and its always a big gulp of fresh air to see any woman over age 40 (gasp!) portrayed as sexy and desirable the devils in the details. In that dizzying, blissed-out moment of anticipation right before sex, most of us are thinking some version of the same thought: yes, yes, yes. If anything, thats all the more true if the moments been a long, slow time coming. So when Carols first spoken thought before enveloping Therese in her arms is I never looked like that, it sticks out, seemingly implying that she sees Therese for what she, Carol, no longer is: young, new, untouched by the emotional and physical toll of passing years. Instead of desiring Therese, its as if Carol is seeing a lost but still inferior version of herself play out against Thereses body. Its just one little line. But it made me consider the ways in which lesbian storylines can sometimes veer into explorations of feminine life stages colliding, in ways that can threaten to supersede explorations of flesh-and-blood relationships between real women. Carol, an extraordinarily beautiful film set in 1950s-era New York, hovers somewhere in that dreamy space between. View this image  Wilson Webb / The Weinstein Company Carol was adapted from Patricia Highsmiths novel The Price of Salt, a groundbreaking work for lesbian readers in the 1950s (and, for that matter, many lesbian readers since); by all accounts, the film would follow suit. The early reviews, starting with its gushed-over premiere at Cannes earlier this year, triumphantly announced that the best lesbian film ever made had finally arrived. For a demographic particularly starved for good, high-quality films, this was an exciting moment indeed. One of my colleagues referred fondly to Carol as Lezzie Mad Men. On the Mad Men front, I agree with her wholeheartedly in terms of aesthetic vibe. The costuming, by Sandy Powell, is a total dream: We first see Carol looking devastatingly luxe in a caramel-colored mink coat, and shes frequently bedecked in scarlet; the whole film is awash with reds. A rapturous score by Carter Burwell floods the film with feeling when otherwise thoughts go more or less unspoken. Judy Beckers production design, too, is slinky and sultry, a divine scenescape of 1950s New York at Christmastime; its rich without quite being warm. In fact, thats how Id describe the film at large. Carol is gorgeous a marvel, even. But its so masterfully orchestrated that the emotional takeaway, to me, is overall more style than substance. Much of the communication between Carol and Therese occurs just under the surface, which could be construed as provocative and intimate. Cate Blanchett is a veritable master of the gaze: In one scene, the women are interrupted at a restaurant during a particularly high-stakes conversation, and the look that Carol gives Therese absolutely overflows with regret, and devastation, and longing. This just-under-the-surface emotional tactic works particularly well in the early stages of a courtship, when its enough for two pairs of eyes to meet across a crowded department store. Once these women actually fall in love, though, I personally would rather that love be verbalized, made explicit. Carols tremulous I love you, near the films end, is all the more shocking because of its expressive rarity. For the most part, Todd Haynes keeps us at a respectable distance one worthy of a gorgeous upper-class ex-housewife with a secret. Of course, on the streets of New York in the 1950s, lesbians did have to take the proper precautions. In that sense, the film relying so much on looks and gestures smartly reflects a time period wherein queer people found one another using physical signals, rather than dating apps. But alone in their many hotel rooms across the Midwest, Carol and Therese have the opportunity to lay themselves bare and those scenes dont carry nearly as much emotional weight as the ones in which either is battling with external elements, whether thats Carols husband or the publics prying eyes. Even moments when theyre alone in Carols car are more moody and visual than personal and revelatory. View this image  The Weinstein Company These women found each other while both adrift: Therese, plugging along in a relationship with a guy she wasnt all that into, itching to throw herself into a more exciting and artistic career; Carol, in the midst of a messy divorce, her husband aware of her past affair with a woman (Sarah Paulson) and threatening to deny her custody of their daughter on moral grounds. Carol and Therese seem to find connection in spite of themselves, thrust out of undesirable life circumstances and into each others arms. While I have no trouble believing their physical pull to each other, a harder sell is why theyd match emotionally beyond mere incidentals. I could see why someone might fall in love with Carol, even if that love was powered by Blanchetts performance alone: Shes glamorous, assertive, sexy, the one who cracks a handful of quiet jokes. Therese, on the other hand, is a relatively empty vessel into which the reserved Mara pours little. At times, these characters seemed more to me like symbolic stand-ins for women, rather than people with intense and complementary inner lives. While theres plenty to be gleaned from glances, Id rather see a relationship built on a little bit more than what simply goes unsaid. A similar sort of interplay defines Clouds of Sils Maria, an Olivier Assayas film and Cannes standout from 2014. Theres plenty of talking when the two main characters Juliette Binoche as aging actress Maria and Kristen Stewart as her younger assistant, Val rehearse lines for one of Marias upcoming plays, but the way both of these women actually feel toward each other is buried deep beneath the scripts in front of them. Maria and Val are acting out the parts of a lesbian relationship, and the sexual tension simmers steadily to their lived surface. Spoiler alert Maria and Val dont actually get together, but instead get steeped in layer upon layer of symbolism: Maria the Older Woman whos terrified of getting replaced by an ingenue, and Val the Younger whos intrigued by Maria, but ultimately not to the extent that shed sleep with her. Theyre foils of each other, womanhood through the looking glass. I once called this particular queerbaiting technique highbrow no homo. Clouds of Sils Maria IFC Films Blue Is The Warmest Color Wild Bunch Of course, in Carol, the women do actually get together, and that is something to celebrate. Whats more and this is major Carol has a (relatively) happy ending. Key word: relatively. In the end, this is still a story about queer oppression in the 50s, and Carol in particular does have to give up something major. But nobody dies! For a queer film, thats a pretty big deal. Weve all grown too used to queer hardship and devastation being refashioned as cheap Oscar bait, a tradition thats hopefully on the outs. Should Carol be critically and commercially successful and it certainly looks to be headed in that direction, with a 95% score on Rotten Tomatoes as of this writing it will signal to a world frustratingly slow on the uptake that queer storylines devoid of tragedy can still resonate, and producers should really start funding more of them. I cant help, though, but feel a slight similarity in the way both Carol and Clouds of Sils Maria treat their characters by allowing tremendous performances (Binoche and Stewart were both killer) alongside other cinematic strengths like camerawork and set design to make the women so ethereal, so representative of something bigger than themselves, as to make them more or less untouchable. So, too, is that the case with Blue Is the Warmest Color, the 2012 French film by the ethically questionable director Abdellatif Kechiche, with its infamous seven-minute lesbian sex scene. After the lead actresses contended theyd been horribly mistreated on set, its hard to watch the film without their revelations in mind especially because their naked bodies are so often graphically matched with marble statues, their characters more symbols of museworthy beauty than they are just plain old ordinary women in love with each other. Though Carol treats its women characters far more gracefully than Blue does, the fundamental love story between Carol and Therese still feels, on the whole, more feminine-figurative than practical. I want to believe that Therese and Carol would love each other beyond mere circumstance, long after the dust settles from their Midwestern getaway in Carols glossy Packard. Even though the film affords us the thrilling possibility of happiness for these women, its difficult for me to imagine what their happiness would actually look like in the gritty rhythms of day-to-day life, when theyre no longer running anymore.

aS"Exclusive: Charles Linden, a high-profile anxiety expert, has been reported to two professional bodies after BuzzFeed News found him offering to treat people who worry they might be gay by telling them theyre not. View this image  Linden Tree Education A high-profile anxiety expert whose clients include several public figures has been reported to his regulatory body after BuzzFeed News found him offering treatment for people who worry they might be gay by telling them they are straight. Charles Linden, dubbed by his publisher the worlds leading authority on anxiety, boasts a clinic on Harley Street and an international anxiety treatment business. He claims on his website to be able to help people recover from what he calls Homosexual Obsessive Compulsive Disorder or HOCD. HOCD also called Gay OCD is not recognised by the medical or psychiatric professions but is described by those who use the term as an obsessive fear of being gay. BuzzFeed News can reveal that Linden, who has no medical, psychiatric, or psychotherapeutic training, offers through his website to remove HOCD permanently, while displaying apparent endorsements from two major organisations for mental health practitioners: the British Psychological Society (BPS) and the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP). After being alerted by BuzzFeed News, the BPS said it would be contacting Linden to remove their logos from his website, and will consider further action. A fellow of the BACP immediately reported Lindens practice to the associations head of professional standards. And a former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, along with two leading LGBT psychotherapists, also condemned Lindens methods as dangerous. The term Homosexual OCD is simply conversion therapy under another guise and something we strongly condemn as damaging, added Prof Elizabeth Peel, chair of the BPSs psychology of sexualities section. BuzzFeed News discovered the website for the Linden Centre also called Linden Tree Education has a section devoted to HOCD entitled Do you get anxious about the possibility of being gay? under which Linden sets out what he sees as the features of the condition before advertising his services. He promises a 100% success rate. After being contacted by BuzzFeed News, the Linden Centre made some changes to the HOCD page on its website; however, BuzzFeed News had already taken screenshots of the original. View this image  Linden Tree Education If you are experiencing HOCD and the thoughts it causes, the site until recently said, you are not gay and when you do my Method to eliminate this and your other anxieties youll find out why you think you might be and why you certainly are NOT! Further down the page, Linden lists the supposed symptoms of HOCD: Do you 1. Obsess that you might be attracted to the same sex as yourself? 2. Look at people of the same sex and get sexual feelings? 3. Test your sexuality by looking at people of the same sex? According to the site, such behaviours arent the same as the thoughts and feelings homosexuals go through as they discover their sexuality. Instead, it advises: Nothing you are experiencing is realthe fact that you are having these thoughts means that you are NOT gay. Linden told BuzzFeed News he has treated 400 or 500 people for HOCD. View this image  Linden Tree Education The Linden Centre claims to have helped over 180,000 people in 60 countries recover from a variety of anxiety disorders, and pictures on its site a wealth of celebrities with whom Linden has worked, including Gok Wan, Jodie Kidd, and Coronation Street actor Kate Ford along with relatives of famous people such as Will Young and Linda Robson. Linden also claims on his site to be an advisor to government and Hollywood stars. Its site promotes a range of products and services through which members of the public can access The Linden Method (a structured programme of learning for myriad anxiety conditions), which includes DVDs, home-learning packs, one-to-one sessions, and residential retreats. A Linden Method pack with membership costs 137. While not claiming to convert gay people to heterosexuality, Linden instead prescribes his method as a cure for those who fear they are gay, and the centres HOCD page details how his method could eliminate such anxieties. How do you recover from Gay/homosexual OCD? it says. By, literally, switching off the mechanism that causes the thoughts to be generated and by correcting anxiety levels systematically in the autonomic nervous system. Its so scientific, simple and effective because it addresses the true causes of your HOCD. Linden describes his method as the ONLY humanly possible process to remove anxiety disorders, which he claims he has used on all ages including children of 5 years. The site also promises his treatment leads to a swift recovery within minutes. Will it work? the page says. It cant fail this is just like eating to satisfy hunger a preset process controls these thoughts what we show you deactivates them. View this image  Linden Tree Education Dominic Davies, founder and director of Pink Therapy, a prominent psychotherapy service for LGBT people, told BuzzFeed News: I am concerned that Linden thinks he can offer a rapid diagnosis of someones troubling mental heath concerns via a checklist of symptoms which could indeed apply to confused gay people, who would then get drawn into his organisation or buy his home treatment DVD and not get the skilled help they need. Davies, a fellow of the BACP Britains largest organisation for therapists expressed concern about Lindens simplistic view of homosexuality, adding: I doubt the confused and troubled client would be adequately served. Davies has reported Linden to the BACPs head of professional standards, as Linden might be in violation of the BACP Ethical Framework its code of conduct. The centres website uses logos from the BACP and the BPS throughout, with references to being regulated and accredited by these organisations. All my staff are MBACP/BPS accredited and members, it says. But the BACP and the BPS confirmed to BuzzFeed News that at least two employees are not members of either the BACP or the BPS, and none are accredited members (a higher level of attainment) of the BACP. While Linden Tree Education does not have corporate membership of the BACP, the BACP informed BuzzFeed News that the Linden Tree Corporation, its parent company, does. If we become aware that an organisation is falsely advertising themselves on promotional material then this is something we would investigate and potentially report to the Advertising Standards Authority and Trading Standards, the BACP added.  View this image  Linden Tree Education Prof Dinesh Bhuga, a former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, also criticised Lindens claims and use of this term. HOCD is not a recognised condition, he told BuzzFeed News. By creating such a condition there is a serious danger of medicalising normal human emotions and turning lots of people who are in various stages of coming out, and for various reasons are struggling to accept their sexuality, into ill individuals. Bhugra added: Creating false unscientific diagnoses like HOCD is also likely to undermine the seriousness of OCD which can be crippling. Dr Paul Blenkiron, a consultant psychiatrist at Tees, Esk and Wear Valley NHS Foundation speaking on behalf of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: I have not heard of anyone with OCD presenting as having an obsessive fear of being gay. So I doubt that this would be the same problem as obsessive-compulsive disorder, which is something different. When contacted by BuzzFeed News, however, Linden defended his service. There are a lot of people walking around that have HOCD, he said. They go through their lives not understanding why theyre having these thoughts, not understanding that theyre actually risk assessments. As a heterosexual man my risk assessment would be, what if I like men?because its the worst-case scenario. So when people with HOCD are having thoughts like, What if Im gay? then clearly its a risk assessment for them for the worst-case scenario. He added: You only have HOCD if youre heterosexual. If you read the page it says, If you suffer from HOCD its not because youre gay. Asked how he decides whether a client is gay or has HOCD, he replied: Its a bit of a process, like lining up the ducks. You just shoot down the ducks. He distanced himself from the term HOCD, which he did not coin, explaining that the Linden Centre uses it within the general terms of what we do as a business because it is what people recognise. View this image  Linden Tree Education The list of HOCD symptoms on the website, said Linden, is to comfort heterosexual men: You cant possibly provide information that reassures straight men that think theyre gay without mentioning how it makes them feel. But the BPSs Elizabeth Peel said: It is not a legitimate therapy. Perpetuating the notion that thoughts about, and desires for, people of the same or different genders, or both, is a disorder requiring treatment is harmful. She added: People should be wary of the way this therapy is being promoted, and there are no published peer-reviewed studies to back up the claims that are being made. The BPS is writing to Linden to demand he remove its logos from his website. We are concerned that the Linden Tree Education Centre appears to be inappropriately using official Society logos such as to give the misleading impression that the Society endorses their services, a BPS spokesperson said. We will be contacting them to advise that they should remove these logos from their websites immediately. We have written to this organisation raising our concerns and will consider further action if necessary. However, Linden insisted he is not trying to cure homosexuality and rebutted the suggestion there is any danger of people who might in fact be bisexual or gay thinking they instead have HOCD after seeing his page. My gay friends knew from an early age what they were, he said. That page is about HOCD, not about being gay. Gay men dont get HOCD where they question their sexuality, because they know theyre gay. When challenged that many gay people question their sexuality, Linden replied that these are not obsessive thoughts and therefore distinct from HOCD. Linden continued: This page is specifically angled to people who are heterosexual who are having inappropriate thoughts about the same sex. Ive never had anyone ever misunderstand this or anything Ive ever said to them before. View this image  Linden Tree Education Any confusion resulting from the page is not Lindens fault, he said, as people viewing the site have to be able to self-monitor. Furthermore, he added, one has to have a certain level of intellect in order to develop anxiety problems. Its a genetic prerequisite to having an anxiety disorder, he said. LGBT psychotherapist Matthew Stinson, an accredited member of the BACP and head of the counselling service at the University of the Creative Arts, told BuzzFeed News: A lot of people take a long time coming to terms with their sexuality they may not know what their sexuality is and particularly young people are often trying to understand their sexuality, so its completely nave to assume a gay person has a fully formed sense of their identity. Stinson also condemned Lindens use of the term HOCD to advertise the Linden Centres services. Its dangerous to pathologise people, he said. Particularly when someone doesnt have proper training to be able to make diagnoses. Using a term like HOCD can cause further damage to people if a young person comes along feeling uncertain about their sexuality, it may lead that person to believe they have a mental illness when they do not. It could be very damaging in the long term. He said the case highlighted the wider failure in Britain to properly regulate psychological treatment. In the UK there is no statutory regulation of psychotherapy and as a result anyone can call themselves a leading expert in anxiety or anything because theyre not bound by law to meet a certain level of standard, he said. Until that changes we will continue to have people call themselves anything they want. Linden defended his use of the term by referring to the fact that OCD UK, an organisation devoted to obsessive-compulsive disorder, mentions it on its website. However, the OCD UK website states that HOCD is not a medically recognised condition. He explained that when a patient asks him to treat their HOCD, the process involves removing overall anxiety. You have to lead them back to what I call physical and emotional equilibrium, he said, that kind of birth preset, that purity of when that first breath was taken after birth. Linden added: So if a gay man sat opposite me says, I dont know if Im gay or not I might have HOCD but I might be attracted to men, its not for me to answer to that, its for us to manoeuvre him to anxiety recovery, and then if the HOCD-type thoughts and symptoms regress and he gets a girlfriend, gets married, and has kids, hes solved his own problem. View this image  Linden Tree Education Linden told BuzzFeed News he has personally helped 400 or 500 people young men and women who go to sleep at night considering taking their own lives because they cant live with the consequences of their dad or mum believing they might be gay. His site claims over 2 million sufferers have used his Resources and Programs; that the Linden Method is recommended by the NHS, used by government agencies, used and referred to by doctors and psychologists world-over; and that Linden has received referrals from psychologists, doctors, psychiatrists, health authorities, insurance companies and other organisations around the world. He told BuzzFeed News he has also had meetings with mental health trusts and clinical commissioning groups (CCGS) with a view to providing the Linden Method through the NHS, but the Department of Health was unable to confirm this claim. A spokesperson told BuzzFeed News: We do not currently recognise HOCD as a condition separate to OCD We would advise anyone choosing to undergo mental health treatment to make sure that the person they choose is appropriately qualified and registered. It is completely unacceptable for anyone to claim to be a consultant or recommended by the NHS without the necessary qualifications. Linden and the Linden Method have been featured widely in the national press, including The Times (which called him the Allen Carr of anxiety), the Sunday Times, The Independent, and the Daily Mail, with Plum Sykes, the contributing editor of Vogue, personally endorsing its efficacy for treating anxiety. Lindens website features photographs of him with Gok Wan while filming an episode of Goks Teens, a Channel 4 series. But these scenes were not broadcast, and a representative for Wan told BuzzFeed News they had no idea Linden was using this material and would be contacting their lawyer to have such references removed from the site. In a statement to BuzzFeed News, the Linden Centre said: We treat causes of anxiety and the Method resolves the anxiety and any manifestations of that anxiety, regardless of how people describe it. On the use of the term HOCD, the centre said: Patients do refer to the condition in this way which is why we speak of it in the same terms. And following the claims on its website of a 100% success rate, the centre said: We do not claim 100% success trials indicate a reduction from GAD7 18.24 to 2.84 post treatment. However, the centre did not provide a source or explanation for these figures. View this image  Charles-Linden.com  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS'Chief Justice John Roberts likely played a key role in the October 2014 Supreme Court decision not to hear the first batch of marriage cases, a move that paved the way for a much less dramatic showdown the following year when the justices ruled for marriage equality. View this image  Chief Justice John Roberts Paul J. Richards / AFP / Getty Images WASHINGTON In October 2014, the Supreme Court declined to hear appeals of any of the cases challenging state bans on same-sex couples marriages. The decision set off a chain reaction in the days that followed, increasing the number of states with marriage equality from 19 to 29. Further moves by the Supreme Court and decisions of lower courts increased the numbers even more. By time the Supreme Court actually heard a marriage case appeals of the cases out of the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, led by Obergefell v. Hodges same-sex couples had married legally in thirty-eight states. In a new article published at the Ohio State Law Journal Furthermore, I detail the process of how that happened, why it matters, and what role Chief Justice John Roberts likely played in making it happen. Had the Justices accepted cert.which requires the vote of only four Justicesin one or more of the cases before it on October 6, 2014, it would have been reaching a decision expanding marriage equality to roughly sixty percent of the states, I write. Instead, its ruling [on June 26, 2015,] affirmed the right in roughly the final twenty-five percent of states still enforcing marriage bans at the time of the decision. The court did this, I write, without considering a single case on the merits or issuing a single precedential decision that would bind lower courts. Although I discussed these issues in articles over the past year, this article raises an additional, key point: The decision to deny cert in October 2014 was made with the support of at least one of the Justices who eventually dissented in Obergefell when that Justice (or those Justices) refused to provide a vote for cert. in October. Because Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas have, since October 2014, made it clear that they believe the court should have granted cert in the first batch of cases in October 2014, that leaves Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito the other two dissenting justices to the Obergefell decision. Although Justice Alito could have refused to vote for cert., a far more likely candidate is Chief Justice Roberts the man interested in protecting the Court itself, I write, explaining how several assessments about Robertss tenure as chief justice note how most notably in the Obamacare cases he has shown himself willing to consider the courts institutional interests as part of his role on the court. While Roberts has faced significant scrutiny for his Obamacare votes, I find it to be striking that there has not been similar attention paid to the likelihood that Roberts prevented a more aggressive showdown over marriage equality by not voting to grant cert in any of the October 2014 marriage case cert petitions. 1.

aS"Todd Haynes the director of Carol, starring Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara talked to BuzzFeed News about working with the actors, love stories, and the importance of preserving queer culture. View this image  Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett in Carol. Wilson Webb / The Weinstein Company Todd Haynes sat on a couch at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills, looking at the decorative magazines on the coffee table in front of him. He had been there all day to talk about Carol, a favorite from this years Cannes Film Festival. In nearby rooms, the films stars, Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, were undergoing a similar junket ritual in order to promote the film, which opens in limited release this weekend. As Haynes thumbed through the luxury magazines, pretending to read one rudely as the interview began, he pointed out Kate Winslet on its cover. Thats my other Kate, he said, referring to his and Winslets 2011 HBO miniseries collaboration, Mildred Pierce. Then Haynes gave a little gasp after noticing that Julianne Moore who starred in his films Safe (1995) and Far From Heaven (2002) was on one of the other covers. Come on, man, he said. Im a lucky guy. Carol is Haynes sixth feature, and the only film he has directed that he did not write. Its based on Patricia Highsmiths 1952 novel The Price of Salt Highsmith used the pseudonym Claire Morgan to avoid the taint of scandal from its lesbian plot and adapted by Phyllis Nagy. The movie tells the story of Therese Belivet (Mara), a young aspiring photographer working as a department store clerk who becomes infatuated with Carol Aird (Blanchett), a wealthy, soon-to-divorce suburbanite. While Therese who is the books narrator, and largely the films point-of-view character too falls for Carol immediately, Carol has bigger things to think about: convincing her estranged husband, Harge (Kyle Chandler), not to take their daughter away as punishment for her romantic interest in other women. Nevertheless, when Carol needs to escape from her life, Therese is there but can their relationship turn into more, especially in New York City in 1952? That is Carols question, and the source of its tension. Its almost a mystery. View this image  Blanchett, Haynes, and Mara at the 68th Cannes Film Festival in May. Anne-Christine Poujoulat / AFP / Getty Images Haynes features are dense with ideas that are surrounded by the physical beauty of their production design, cinematography, and costumes. Perhaps fittingly then, in the case of Carol, he originally heard of the project in 2012 from its costume designer, Sandy Powell, who had worked on Haynes Far From Heaven and Velvet Goldmine: She told him there was a frock film that might interest him. After eventually being hired to direct it, Haynes filmed Carol in spring 2014 in Cincinnati, which passed much more easily for 50s New York than current New York could. Cincinnati had an architectural integrity that was rare for a smaller city today, Haynes said. We literally shot on certain streets with existing signage to stand in for 1952 New York City. Haynes talked with BuzzFeed News about constructing this complicated love story, working with Blanchett and Mara, and why its still important to tell queer stories in a way that marks them as unique and different. What drew you to Carol once you were approached to direct it? Todd Haynes: I love that novel. I thought it was so powerful, and thought it was such an acute portrait of the kind of early grapplings of love the disempowerment of that position that weve all been in. I used to fall hard when I was younger, and it occupies a lot of journals and redundant preoccupation and analysis. It is a state in which you are in an overheated fervor of production of mental production where youre analyzing everything that happened. And what they said! And how they looked! Did that touch mean something, or not? Everything is sort of endowed with meaning, but youre also hopelessly boring and out of the world. View this image  The Weinstein Company And Phyllis Nagys script had been something she was working on for years, trying to get this movie made. TH: I thought the script was beautiful. I thought that I sensed perhaps the marks of some de-fanging of the story in an attempt to get it financed. When I talked to Phyllis about that and said, Some of the tensions in the book I think are so great maybe we can put them back in? She was like, Yes! Youre trying to appeal to financiers and make the two women have an immediate rapport and everythings nice. The book had so many more levels of disquiet. And discomfort. Carol is at times searing as a presence around Therese. Shell say things, and youll be, like, Ooh! Ow. Youve written all of your movies. How different was the experience not to? TH: It was different because it was so intact. I came upon something so thoroughly considered before my process entered into it. When I write my scripts, theres a point at which if Im not starting to see them visually, I feel like Im kind of cheating. So my scripts are laden with a lot of visual description, which makes them not so much fun to read I kind of weigh them down. This was not as true for this script; this was a very pleasurable script to read. But I still felt I needed to start seeing it. And seeing it meant, like, Whose eyes are we seeing these things through? And just wanting to be very mindful of how we find access to Carols world when Therese is not witnessing it. In the end, whether I write the script or, in this case, somebody else did, theres a point where you let it go when youre making a movie. You just have to. The thing that you shoot is not what you imagined in your head it never is exactly that. And it shouldnt be. View this image  The Weinstein Company Cate Blanchett was already attached to the movie when you signed on. Did you cast Rooney Mara? TH: I did. I had been watching her with great admiration and attention. Its a hard part because all the action is on the other side, in a way. I found that with Rooney, her instincts in films was always to underplay and to sort of reduce down what was necessary to bring you in a sense of economy, a sense of scale, which just seemed to understand the medium so well. When you see that in a younger actor, I always think it speaks to incredible knowledge. I cant exactly figure out where that comes from, that confidence to know how to be quiet. The Therese character is so held in, and when she does talk, she says things like, all I ever do is say yes to everything. Shes a passive person who is about to turn into something else. I wondered what its like for you as a director and also for the actors to shoot scene after scene where things are unsaid. TH: I never felt like I had to lay down the rulebook on the actors, or what the films language would be. Theres something festering and not verbalized about the book, because youre so inside Thereses head. I think everybody was oriented by that, even if we werent talking about it. I do remember being in the rehearsal process with Rooney and Cate, and at times saying, Rooney in particular, Does she need to say this? And Id go, No, she doesnt. Youre right. Lets cut it! We just realized by not saying it, there would be more power. It also meant that the camera had something more to do, and that the music had something more to do. And the small gestures meant more. It just changed the scale of information in general. View this image  Wilson Webb / The Weinstein Company When youre watching them do takes of the same scene in a movie where its so much about them looking at each other and doing those small gestures, are you seeing it work as it happens? TH: Because it was so much about Thereses desire for Carol as a way into the story and Carol as a sort of inexplicable object, someone you couldnt totally figure out, but who casts a spell both actors had to be aware of that, and know what the camera was observing, and what their performances need to reflect. And I think that speaks so much to what Cate was doing, because she has to sort of play the image of Carol as seen through Therese at very specific times in the film and then start to peel back those layers, and show us the complicated woman beneath that. But if she played it too intimately to the camera, or too colloquially, or too ingratiatingly Im not sure what the word is, but if she was just trying to appeal to your trust as a viewer, that illusion and that desire would be shattered. It wouldnt work. And the language of the film wouldnt work. So they knew how to pull back, particularly Cate, and play all these different proximities to the camera, to the viewer, to Therese. Thats a really subtle dance. Especially when youre shooting out of sequence, and the movie has a movement that gets closer to Carol, but has to maintain distance from Carol at certain key points. Carol seems to know what she wants, despite all of the terrible obstacles in her path. TH: Im not so sure about that. I think shes attracted to Therese, but Therese is such a foreign object in her world that I always felt that there are places where shes spending all this time with Therese, and it feels almost like an escape. I dont think she knew that this is what she wants. And I think there are times Therese is irritating she has no point of view, she has no criteria for what shes choosing. Its only when you look back sometimes and you look at some people in your life and youre like, Oh my god, there was something so pure about that. The thing that kind of bugged me, maybe, is the thing thats so unique. But ironically, by the time Carol re-evaluates Therese and comes back, Therese is no longer that person largely due to Carol! And thats so much more interesting than a story of two lesbians who just want to get together, but the world stops them from getting there. Its like, No! People are full of all kinds of questions and are two steps forward, one step back, in our choices that we make. Sometimes you make choices too late, and you lose the thing that you wanted that was there for you. View this image  The Weinstein Company Youve been such an important chronicler of queer culture. You told Manohla Dargis in the New York Times that in the pre-Stonewall era, there was no other choice but to form a critical subtext to dominant society and to use wit and humor and art and language to basically stand outside. Do you think theres a future when that difference will have completely collapsed? TH: I think were getting there. I think thats what happens with assimilation of minority cultures into majority cultures. And of course its a trade-off: You gain all of the rights and privileges and respects that are afforded the majority, and thats ultimately what matters for your kids, or anybody because were all innocent of the fact that we are the way we are. But it also means the ways that you coped, and the languages and narratives and points of view that you had no choice but to make from the sidelines and that often carried with them really acute readings of dominant society those no longer have the same need. But will there ever be a gay James Bond? Will there ever be a lesbian Katniss Everdeen? When youre talking about mass culture, at least in film, stories about gay people usually have something to do with their gayness. TH: I guess? I just dont mind that. Im not ready to give up gayness in and of itself as something unique and different. A litmus test for me for all of it was the bisexual imagination and the androgynous imagination of the Glam era. Because that meant everybody was implicated in this uncertain sense of sexual self, and it meant that everything was unstable. I guess Im just not that interested in stable notions of identity, whatever they are. Velvet Goldmine Miramax Films Far From Heaven Focus Features Your early work felt so directly informed by 80s academic theory. Years after the Brown University semiotics program, do you still feel like you approach film as a semiotician? TH: I dont know that I ever did. It more became a parallel language for questions I already was having. I didnt know what semiotic theory was, I just knew that was where they had their film production courses at Brown. I went to one of my first theory courses, and I remember the teacher talking about the classic Hollywood text, and saying, And then it ends with the obligatory heterosexual closure. And I was just, like, Wow, he just stated the thing that we never say, but is just a given. Simply by saying it, all of a sudden its no longer a natural thing an automatic preset mode. Its a decision, its a tradition, its an imposition, whatever you want to call it. That one moment felt so empowering. I knew that inside, but somebody stating it gave me a tool. Do you make as many movies as you want to make? TH: I guess I do. Theres things on the horizon Id love to do that Ive been like, When am I going to have time to really develop that? But Carol was such a great example of something I didnt see coming. And it became such a great learning experience. Doing a love story as a genre, and looking at love stories in movies, and feeling like I learned stuff about that, and that it broadened my view and my idea of what I can do, and how I can work with the people around me, that was such a great, really satisfying experience.

aS"More trans women were killed in the United States in the past 12 months than any year on record and nowhere do the violence and homicides appear as concentrated as the Palmer Park area in Detroit. BuzzFeed News went to ask trans women who live there what they think is happening. I know of seven girls who have been murdered out here, said Lakyra Dawson. Out as a transgender woman for seven years, Dawson was standing across from Detroits Palmer Park on Woodward Avenue. The area is known as an enclave for LGBT people during the daytime, but at night, the parks 300 acres of fields and forest are the citys epicenter of violence against transgender women a problem worsening at the same time awareness about transgender people has been growing. People are kinda ruthless now more than ever, you know, said Dawson. The killers, the murderers. The violence is getting more wild and more crazy. I feel like we are being targeted. In a three-month span, three black trans or gender-nonconforming people were killed in Detroit this year, two near Palmer Park. During one week in summer 2014, three transgender women were shot, one fatally, near the park. Those incidents dont include countless other stories relayed to BuzzFeed News by police and trans women about robberies, knifings, sucker-punchings, more homicides, dismemberment, charred bodies, trans women being shoved out of moving cars, and other acts of violence against trans women nearby in recent years. I seen people get shot, jumped on, robbed, everything, said Beyonc Carter she has a name like the singer while checking over her shoulder every few seconds to keep her eye on a man standing on the corner. I dont want to be out here hell no. But some days, I just say, Fuck it, I need some money. For Carter, Dawson, and other trans women BuzzFeed News interviewed in Detroit, facing this environment isnt a choice. I want to be a girl, so if thats the risk you take, Im taking it. Im sorry, Carter said. Its about who I am, and I love me. I do what I got to do to survive. Woodward Avenue begins at the Detroit River, forming the citys central aorta through downtown. The six lanes go northwest past glass towers, then chic bars and salons, then strip malls and auto shops and empty industrial buildings, and eventually reaching the hulking beige Dj Vu strip club near the southern tip of the park at the intersection of Six Mile Road. Six Mile and Woodward? the front-desk man at the Holiday Inn Express said. Thats where all the trans women are. Just past the intersection, directly across the street from Palmer Park, northbound drivers slow down to assess the stroll, as its called, a strip for johns to find a date. The women sometimes linger, or they strut south past the Fontaine Motel. They check themselves out in what they call the mirrors dark reflective windows of a real estate office on the corner of Worcester Place and head south past a coin laundry, the Bread Basket, a 24-hour video store, and a sports bar, until they reach a gas station. From where she stood on Woodward Avenue on a frigid Thursday night, Dawson pointed out where 20-year-old Amber Monroe was shot dead after she got out of a car on Aug. 8. Dawson was around the corner from the side street where a person who simply went by the name Melvin who numerous people said was a gay man who worked as a transgender woman was found fatally shot on Oct 5. Dawson said she was pistol-whipped and robbed one night last year by a man behind a restaurant up the street. And down the block, a 53-year-old transgender womans body was found two years ago stuffed into a trash container in the back alley, the womans corpse so badly burned that police could not identify her remains (a medical examiner identified her weeks later by the male name Calvin Curtis Lipscomb). People say were not normal, were freaks or something, said Dawson. They just feel like they can dispose of us, because we really dont matter to them. My reaction is kinda like, tired, because its still going on and its not enough justice. The police come, and they ask questions and do their slight investigations, but I dont see any change. Confirmed homicides of transgender women have nearly doubled in the United States within the past year. Friday, Nov. 20, marks the annual Transgender Day of Remembrance. The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs reported 24 homicides between Nov. 20, 2014, and the same date in 2015, compared with 12 during the previous year. Seventeen of the victims since this time last November were black trans women or black gender-nonconforming people; four were Latina; just three were white. The circumstances of each killing are different, and by no means is sex work a common thread among all transgender women or among those who were killed. Still, in several cases in recent years, cops have treated transgender women as sex workers regardless sometimes making arrests and then releasing the women even though there was no evidence of sex work. Many other people undoubtedly assume the same. But in Detroit, the six black transgender women or gender-nonconforming people who were killed in the last three years had been involved in sex work, Officer Danni Woods told BuzzFeed News. It was not known if sex work was linked to their killings. Among the victims was Ashton OHara, who was reportedly stabbed on July 14 on the citys east side before being run over by a car. I dont think its a target on the back of trans women or trans women of color, said Woods, who serves as a liaison between the Detroit Police Department and the LGBT community. But its more violent to me than other crimes like you hate this person. It tends to be more aggressive; it tends to be more hostile. Its definitely more graphic. But trans women in Detroit who spoke to BuzzFeed News believe they are targeted, attacked simply for being who they are or because they are in a neighborhood where trans women are known to congregate. Ashia, who declined to provide her last name, said she was standing on Woodward one night when a man approached. How are you? he said. I said, Hi, how are you? Then he just hit me. He hit me as hard as he could. Like you know when you see the light? she said, touching the side of her eye. Next thing I know I am fighting this strong man, and I cant get away. He didnt try to rob me or anything, she said. He was way stronger than me. He wasnt stopping. He would have killed me. I would have died. I ran, and he chased me, but he didnt catch me. He didnt say, Give me your purse, give me your phone, give me your money. It was nothing. He just fought me. Around 11 p.m. on a cold, wet, windy evening, one woman walked the stroll heading south, then north, then south again. Im assuming she has no other way to eat or a place to stay that is the only reason why anybody would subject themselves to being out here, said Julisa Abad, a trans woman and activist. She works a 21-hour-a-week job that pays $8.50 an hour barely making enough to eat and pay rent but uses her spare time advocating for trans women in Detroit. They always say theyre scared, Abad continued. But if this is the only way you know to make money to eat, or have a place to stay, where else are you gonna go? If attackers were trying to do something, were kind of making it easy for them. Were just sitting ducks, she said. We are making it too easy for them. View this image  Julisa Abad at the mirrors. Laura McDermott for BuzzFeed News Dawson came back out to Woodward a month after Monroe was gunned down. Once someone gets killed, some girls come out here the same night, the next day, said Dawson, getting into a Toyota sedan parked on Woodward. But some girls, we stay away for like a month, probably two. When things like that happen, and you dont have another route, you just have to suck it up and do what you have to do. I needed to get my hair did, buy clothes, eat, you know. Personal anecdotes and academic studies echo common explanations for how transgender women end up working in a survival economy: Families ridicule or beat transgender girls when they try to come out. Kids tease them at school, and teachers punish them for wearing clothes that clash with gender expectations. They leave home young, often without diplomas, and move to cities and neighborhoods where they can find transgender families that offer emotional support. And then, turned away from employers who make empty promises to call you back, the women come to places like Six Mile and Woodward for money. Joblessness among transgender people was at 14% in 2011, double the national average at the time, according to the most comprehensive survey to date on anti-trans discrimination. Black transgender respondents were unemployed at double that rate, 28%, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Forces survey. Ive tried to apply for jobs before, said Dawson, but I never gotten a lot of callbacks. I cant say what happened. We want to have careers. Everybody dont want to be out here. Forty-four percent of the surveys 6,450 trans or gender-nonconforming respondents believed they didnt get a job they applied for due to gender identity. And those who had been unemployed due to their gender identity were far more likely to be engaged in sex work. Again, the survey authors wrote, black trans women reported the highest rate at 44%. Those national figures were reinforced by a November study by the District of Columbia Office of Human Rights. The government-run investigation found that 48% of employers tested in the capital preferred a less qualified non-transgender applicant over a more qualified transgender person seeking a job. In 33% of the cases, the less qualified applicant was offered an interview when the trans person wasnt. Ashia was invited to sign paperwork and give fingerprints for a job in Detroit, she said, but the hiring manager paused after seeing her ID. Once she figured out what was going on and that I was born male, she kinda totally changed her whole demeanor, Ashia recalled. Then she was like, Well call you. Ashia remembers thinking: You called me to come in today. What happened between now and then? They never called. In Detroit, the city council has banned LGBT discrimination in employment and housing but its not clear that employers in the city know about the law, or that job applicants feel they have recourse if theyre turned away. Discriminating on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation is legal in Michigan. (There are no federal laws explicitly protecting LGBT people from employment discrimination, though several federal agencies argue current civil rights laws provide those protections.) None of the transgender women in Detroit who spoke to BuzzFeed News felt like victims, powerless to get a job, intractably subjected to violence they all had agency to work as they wanted and defend themselves. But they didnt like their conditions, either. I dont wanna do this, but I have got to eat, have to have somewhere to go. Its $60 a day here, Ashia said, sitting on the edge of a bed in a motel room. An empty Little Caesars pizza box was by the door. Lately I havent really applied myself, and thats because I got comfortable with the sex work. Its fast money. But she knows its dangerous money. It is scary not knowing if this could be your last time living or your last time being able to speak to your family because you were trying to eat. Stats on trans women are scarce, but the scant examples show that anti-trans discrimination is also common among landlords. In a report released in June, 67% of landlords gave different treatment to transgender people seeking apartments in a test conducted by the the Seattle Office for Civil Rights. In one case, the Seattle Times reported in June, the city agency found a property manager who told a transgender person that no units were available. But within 30 minutes, the company told a cisgender person the term for people who are non-transgender about two units for rent. View this image  Rebecca OHara with Ashton OHaras remains in her home. Laura McDermott for BuzzFeed News Thats Ashton in that box, Rebecca OHara said, gesturing to an end table in her living room. She carried the black container, which bears the date of her childs cremation, to the dining room table. Im trying to get an urn. I sit with him every day. Ashton was gender-nonconforming, using female and male pronouns and sometimes identifying as transgender. At home, he would say he was my son. So maybe you could word it in a way where he could be identified the way he wanted to be identified, but when you refer to me speaking about him, you can refer to me speaking about my son, she said. Like many mothers who love and support their transgender kids, OHara feared for Ashtons safety. I would always ask him, If you are going to dress like a girl, could you please do it while youre on your way to the club so youll be among your peers, where people accept you? she began. Please dont do it in the daytime, and please dont feel free to walk at night, because somebody else may not agree with it, get violent because of it. Although many people wont answer calls from unfamiliar phone numbers, I always have, she said. I never knew if it was somebody calling to say something was wrong with my son. So every time my phone would ring late at night, I was always terrified it was going to be that call, and one day, it was in the morning, and it was actually that call. So it was something I was trying to prepare myself for. He was such a free spirit and he never really felt like something was going to happen to him, she said. He always felt like he would be able to handle it. I mean, all the way back in middle school people used to try to attack him, and he had never had a problem with fighting his way out of the situations. Its been a long time coming, I believe. The attack on Ashton happened around 4 a.m., she said. By the time we got the phone call, it had to be about 11 in the morning. When the ambulance got there, he still had a pulse, so he had to be laying there that whole time. OHara said the violence against transgender women in Detroit has been getting worse as support for marriage equality grows and transgender people gain prominence. Ive known for the maybe last 10 to 15 years that violence against transgender people was a problem, she said. It wasnt highly publicized. She stood up to grab some tissues and wipe her eyes. I wouldnt want anybody to misinterpret my feelings about this, but there were, like, mixed emotions, OHara said. For years I was living, waiting on this call. And so when it happened, I was mortified because I knew I was going to miss my son forever. And I really didnt how to deal with that. But at the same time, it was like this heavy burden was lifted, like its happened, you know. So I dont even really know how to express that feeling because I felt bad for feeling like a weight had lifted off of me. View this image  A photo of Coko Williams a transgender woman who was killed in April 2012 in a remembrance display at the Ruth Ellis Center. Laura McDermott for BuzzFeed News As the number of trans homicides sharply increased this year, antiviolence advocates described the trend as a crisis and an epidemic. Yet nobody knows, exactly, why the number of confirmed homicides of transgender people is rising. Among the theories: They are simply better reported. A growing national consciousness that trans people exist means that people press police to correctly report and record the murders beyond just noting a man in a dress. Or reporters connect the dots when police dont. Or families are growing more forthcoming about publicizing a victims gender identity. On the other hand, the homicides could just be increasing. There has never been accurate reporting; people are always misgendered, and families dont want to admit that their loved one is trans sometimes, said Leah Taraskiewicz, the victim advocate at Equality Michigan, an LGBT antiviolence group and a member of the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, which attempts to track trans homicides. The size of the transgender population is not well-studied, so it is impossible to conclusively compare homicide rates of trans people to other populations. That said, its worth making an unscientific, back-of-the-envelope estimate. And it makes sense to examine the population getting killed: overwhelmingly black trans women. Most federal surveys designed to estimate populations simply dont account for trans people, according to the Williams Institute. A 2011 report by the UCLA think tank pegged the total national trans population at just below 700,000, based on various data sources. If about 6.5% of the trans population is black and female like the percentage of the general population that is black and female that would suggest there are roughly 45,500 black transgender women in the U.S. With 17 black transgender women confirmed killed in the past 12 months, that would suggest there would be a homicide rate of about 37 black trans women in a population of 100,000. This rate comparing a figure to a 100,000-person population is a little odd when it is likely there are not even 100,000 black trans women in the U.S. However, this is the formula that the Bureau of Justice Statistics used for other crime stats in a survey released in 2012. It found that black people had the highest homicide rate of any race about six times that of whites. The Violence Policy Center found that, according to those federal stats, the homicide rate for black male victims was 31.67 per 100,000 people, and for black female victims was 4.54. There are almost certainly more homicides of black trans women, because police chronically misgender trans homicide victims leaving many deaths never accounted for.

Laura McDermott for BuzzFeed News Officer Will Williams drove a squad car south on Woodward, pointing out the stroll to his left. This is where everything happens. On a warmer night, youll see 10 to 15 bodies, maybe more, he said. I dont think they know the risk they are putting themselves in, just someone who is looking to hurt them. Officer Linda Gilbert, sitting in the passenger seat while Michael Jackson played on the radio, added, I think that some of them are targeted because of their sexual choices what they choose to be, men dressed like women. Some people think that transgender people are sick. But she added, I dont have a problem with transgender people. They are very respectful. Then the pair did a U-turn at Six Mile Road. The city of Detroit surrounds the small city of Highland Park. The jurisdictions share a border at Six Mile Road in the middle of the strip of Woodward where many women work and walk. These women cross the border regularly, as do police for the Highland Park Police Department, responding to emergency calls or stopping transgender women on the street, several women said in interviews. They will pull over and, on the bullhorn, say loud as hell, What the fuck are you nasty-ass men doing out here? Get your triflin, ugly asses across the street, said Abad, the activist. They call you a man, a fag. Carter recounted the same: They do it to humiliate. Detroit Officer Woods has heard the same stories about Highland Park cops and trans women. I have yet to hear a positive story. Its all negative, she said. But Officer Calvin Wimberly of the Highland Park Police Department told BuzzFeed News that transgender women never come on our side never for some reason. That is, he contended, trans women simply reach Six Mile Road and never cross it. Not only did transgender women and antiviolence advocates laugh at this claim, they pointed out that the Ruth Ellis Center, a popular LGBT facility that transgender women visit daily, is located in the center of Highland Park. Wimberly, though, insisted there is no reason officers from his department would ever interact with transgender women and said he is not aware of any instance of his officers speaking to trans women. Dawson said the Highland Park polices behavior could actually encourage more violence. When they are the ones doing the harassing, it makes it looks like its OK for everyone else to harass us. She says people think, If police are doing it, maybe we can do it. A 2014 study of transgender women in Detroit, published in Sexuality Research and Social Policy, reported that police in the area the study doesnt specify which departments were also implicated as participants in sex work as johns or clients. In two cases, participants told researchers: Oh, the police are no different than johns to me. They use their authority to get what they want The same thing that the rest of them want, but they want it for nothing Because they are police, I can take you to jail if you dont suck my dick. I had a client before and after we, after we got finished, he told me, You know not to come out here Thursdays or Tuesdays. And I said, What do you mean? He said, You know, thats sting night. I said, How you know its sting night? He said, Im an officer. View this image  Inside Ashias room at the Motorama Motel. Laura McDermott for BuzzFeed News BuzzFeed News spoke to women who also said they had heard from sex workers that Highland Park police have dated the women a euphemism for meeting for sex. They believe that relationship, combined with instances of humiliation and misgendering, further alienates trans women, who witness crimes and could provide key information to identify suspects or catch assailants. Abad explained, What makes you feel like they are going to be comfortable enough to come forward if these same people that we are supposed to trust are not only taking us to jail, beating and ridiculing us, but you also have some crooked ones on the force who are dating us as well? Highland Park Police Chief Kevin Coney, reached by phone, did not say whether his officers have had sex with trans women. What people do in their personal life you heard that some officers were dating transgenders [sic] I dont know if its a fact or a lie. I dont listen to hearsay, the chief continued. If its not on paper, I dont listen to it. Coney also could not confirm whether his officers had ever interacted with transgender people, saying it was a possibility. Asked if he knew of violence against transgender women, Coney said: Not that I am aware of, any violence. And he described his thinking on transgender identities like this: If you say you are transgender, then thats what you are. I might say I am Superman. Some people might say Im crazy. Police around the country often misgender trans women as men particularly after death, when police rely on IDs that refer to a victims birth sex. A dead person cant divulge their gender identity. For example, police in Maryland called Zella Ziona, who was murdered in October, a man because they went by the drivers license, even though her purse lay in plain view at the crime scene. Police later issued a press release with Zionas correct gender. Police in Louisville, Kentucky, insisted to BuzzFeed News that a victim killed in January was also a man, yet a BuzzFeed News investigation of records and an interview with a witness found that the victim was presenting as a woman at the time of the homicide she had just told the shooter she was trans, and he got angry before he shot her. Police still refused to acknowledge that gender identity may have been a factor in the case. This pattern can hamper investigations by misidentifying victims and alienating people who could assist. When Amber Monroe was shot in Detroit, her boyfriend, who asked to be identified only as K, was a few blocks away. When I got there, she was laying on the ground and police told me to get back. Police were being rude and told me it was none of my business. Shelly Hilliard was burned and dismembered in Detroit three days after working as an informant for the nearby Madison Heights police, according to Courthouse News. The murder was investigated in the documentary Treasure. I have seen too much stuff happen out here, Carter said. But Im not going to tell [police] anything, because I risk myself. Officer Woods said that when cisgender sex workers are shot or stabbed, you know, they go to the hospital, they call. Citizens are more apt to say this lady is out here, there is a lady on the ground. Whereas if its in the trans community, sometimes people ignore it. Theyll drive by. Its not reported. Officer Woods recounted stories from inside the Detroit police department from the past 15 years: An officer once called her a dyke, and police responding to a household of two men concluded the guys must be fags, for example. But more officers are developing competency with LGBT people, slowly. I dont want to totally say everybody is over that cultural hurdle, said Woods, because everybody is not. Twinges of discrimination still linger with some cops. Its still there. And that is going to take time. Woods acknowledged that derisive behavior from police creates mistrust among trans women. When you call the police for help and they talk at you or mistreat or refuse to help you, where do you go from there? she said. But at the same time, she said that when some trans women talk about being harassed, they need to be reminded what they do for a living. Because I wear both hats, I have to give it to them straight: Youre prostituting; that is a crime. Detroit police convened an LGBT advisory board on Tuesday for the first time, and Woods said she did not invite the Highland Park police. Its also difficult to ascertain how much of the forces LGBT outreach is backed up with anything more than gestures. Misgendering victims further upsets people when families do it. Monroe was buried by her family in male attire, her boyfriend said. Jessie Fullenkamp, the youth services director at the Ruth Ellis Center, recalled, Amber was buried as her family knew her very masculine. She was wearing a plaid button-up shirt and slacks. She didnt have her hair or her nails done. Monroes mother, Pamela, declined an interview with BuzzFeed News. But Jerry Peterson, executive director of the Ruth Ellis Center, confirmed with Pamela that she has been unable to get any information from police about her daughters homicide since the initial interview. Its still under investigation, so she hasnt been able to get Ambers things back, Peterson said. There is just no movement at all. Its also difficult to ascertain how much police prioritize tracking these homicides. For two weeks, BuzzFeed News asked Woods and others at the police department if they had any press releases or announcements even a list of homicides of transgender people documenting the trend. Although police officials initially said they had that information handy, they later punted, suggesting two days before this story was published that BuzzFeed News would have to file a request under the Freedom of Information Act, which could take weeks or months to fulfill. View this image  Detroit Police Officer Danni Woods, the departments LGBT liaison. Laura McDermott For BuzzFeed News In the last 12 months, Christian conservatives and Republican politicians have increasingly raised the specter of transgender women, and men posing as them, sexually assaulting young girls. Such arguments have been raised to challenge or defeat transgender nondiscrimination laws in Arkansas, North Carolina, Missouri, Florida, California, and Texas. That message was the primary rallying cry in Houston over the past two months, saturating radio and TV stations with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of ads to repeal a nondiscrimination ordinance there. A man who says that he is a transgender female is still a man, no matter what he thinks he is, said a mailer from the Houston campaign. It said being transgender is deviant behavior and suggested that the citys trans nondiscrimination law allowed perverted men to harm women in the bathroom. A TV commercial showed a man trapping a young girl inside a bathroom stall. Seventeen states and 200 cities have nondiscrimination laws for gender identity, and there are no examples of those laws enabling a trans woman or anyone to assault a woman. But still, Texass governor and lieutenant governor raised that argument in order to repeal the Houston law and voters did, by a 22-point margin, on Nov. 3. The underlying message of this nationally viral narrative is obvious: that transgender people are dangerous and sexually scheming. That transgender people are a threat for even being alive. Hyper-visibility doesnt always mean that people are more safe, warned Ahya Simone, a 23-year-old transgender woman who recently graduated from Wayne State University in Detroit and works as a freelance harpist. Hyper-visibility can also make us vulnerable to violence. It makes you a target. Simone is sick of the bathroom debate and sick of what happens when she uses restrooms herself. Staff at a library recently banned her from a womens restroom after finding out she was trans. Last month, she encountered the opposite problem at a bar when she used the mens restroom. The bouncer was at the door, and he said, You have to go, said Simone. I was laughing in my mind. I mean, where am I supposed to go then? I dont think any of it is a fluke, but I dont think it is a Law & Order conspiracy, Fullenkamp said of the killings in Detroit. If we are not going to allow someone to do the most simple acts of a human existence use a bathroom, live in a home, have a job we are creating a society that is setting those individuals up for violence. Simone said when lives like hers are devalued, people think they are almost doing a favor by removing us. Even when you talk about the murders, you have to talk about how these people were murdered and most of them in gruesome and disgusting ways. Part of that comes from that feeling of having to erase these peoples existence. View this image  Ahya Simone in the Ruth Ellis Center office. Laura McDermott for BuzzFeed News After Zionas killing in October, U.S. Sen. Al Franken sent a letter to the Justice Department and the FBI asking how federal officials planned to deal with or even track what he described as the disturbing trend of anti-transgender violence this year. He pointed out that federal hate crime statistics accounted for only 33 anti-transgender bias crimes in 2013, the most recent year theres data for, a figure so implausibly low as to be meaningless. The FBI office in Detroit did not answer questions from BuzzFeed News about whether the bureau, which tracks crime statistics, had any records of anti-transgender violence in the city. The city also produced no information. Absent substantial data, people can only speculate on how bad the problem is and how to stop it. Trans women and advocates who spoke to BuzzFeed universally wanted government leaders especially local figures to take a more visible role condemning anti-trans violence. They said Michigan Republicans, who control a majority in both chambers, should pass a transgender nondiscrimination bill that has languished in the legislature. They said human services should boost provisions for trans people, and police need more basic training on cultural competency. In making its recommendations, the academic study of transgender women in Detroit from 2014 added that the minimum investigative mandates for reported assaults should be enhanced and that sex work should be decriminalized and regulated. Its unclear how much violence stems from anti-transgender bias and how much results from the circumstances these women live in. It could also be a combination or none of the above. Often, readers will speculate on social media that a transgender woman tricked a man who then became angry. But it seems implausible in many cases: Women working Woodward Avenue in Detroit are essentially all transgender; cisgender women work on John R. Street, and men work on Covington Drive. We all know that, said OHara. Everyone from police officers interviewed for this article to hotel clerks and cab drivers knew that the women in that area are transgender. Trans women also self-identify before getting in cars. The girl will just come out and say, Im a tranny, said Abad. And the guys are ready for you to get in the car and go. Rather than blame victims, Dawson said, the public needs to embrace trans women like other women. We still have the same heartbeat; the same blood pumps through us. I shouldnt be able to walk down the street, and a group of people laugh at me, and nobody says anything about it. Real women walk down the street and get her purse snatched, everyone is going to hurry up and defend and get justice served. But if I get my head cut off, this month people say, Lets say her name, but next month, nothing is said about it. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Gwen Araujo, a trans teenager, was killed in 2002. Thirteen years later, whats really changed? A look back on Trans Day of Remembrance. View this image  Ruth Gwily for BuzzFeed News I was in an online chat room, in October of 2002, when someone asked whether we had heard about the girl who was killed not too far from where I lived in San Francisco. Her name was Gwen. A group of guys beat her up for hours before she died, someone typed. She slept with a couple of them, then they found out she had a penis. My first thought: Why did Gwen put herself in that situation? But of course I knew why I put myself in Gwens situation many times, trying to find affirmation at a time when a trans woman like me was either someone to hate or a fetish object, with no option in between. Back in 2002, I thought it was my obligation to disclose as trans to possible partners not because of my safety, but because it was somehow the worst type of deception if I wasnt upfront about my status. People understand if you dont divulge other sorts of private information on a first date alcoholism, being adopted, whatever. But somehow, being attracted to a trans woman who hasnt had bottom surgery is such a harmful affront to a mans sense of self that even other trans women made me feel as though the potentially violent consequences of nondisclosure were my responsibility. Yet I couldnt help but keep my trans status to myself, repeatedly, because it often felt safer. Ive had several experiences of disclosing to men who hit on me at parties or bars, just to realize 15 minutes later that everyone around me was in on the joke, laughing openly at me. It was often hard to tell whether it was safer not to tell the one person who was pursuing me, or risk an entire party knowing about my status when I might have become the target of any strangers hate. At the time, the world taught me that even when it was those men who approached me in the first place, the fault still lay with me if something bad were to happen. Just by being assigned male and dressing in a way that would cause others to perceive me as a woman, its already my fault our fault, as trans women when we are shouted at with slurs, beaten, or worse. But still, what happened to Gwen I could not even imagine. I was already out of college. She was a vulnerable trans girl in high school, that time when being cute and finding acceptance in others, especially boys, is often the most important thing. California is one of those odd states that has pockets of trans acceptance, but Gwen lived in Newark, 40 miles away from the Bay Area. For her, San Francisco might as well have been that unreachable queer oasis in a desert of straights. Yet Gwen dared to be who she was dared to present the way she saw herself, as a young woman. And when men began to see her the way she wanted to be seen, she decided not to tell them about her history. And when they found out, their hate and disgust drove them to murder her.  View this image   I went to a vigil in Gwens honor on Nov. 8, 2002, on the opening night of Newark Memorial High Schools production of The Laramie Project, Moises Kaufmanns play about the death of Matthew Shepard in Wyoming in 1998, an event that became a rallying point for preventing anti-gay violence in the U.S. That vigil was not so different from others Ive been to since, involving candles and words remembering the fallen, recalling Gwens spirit and life. My friend Robin shot video of that night, of the gathered crowd, some dressed as angels, as we all strained to light candles in the rain. Both Gwens lawyer Gloria Allred and her mom Sylvia Guerrero spoke about Gwens life and her conviction in her womanhood, even though they and others repeatedly shifted back and forth between pronouns and names. Allred asserted her conviction that Gwens killers would be brought to justice, as Allred asked the crowd to shout the refrain, We have no doubt! We have no doubt! What I remember most clearly now is the way that Matthew Shepard and Gwen Araujo were treated as though their cases were really similar to each other: that Gwen was the victim of a hate crime, and her attackers needed to be brought to justice. Within the small confines of that supportive group, the possibility that Gwens killers would receive the same harsh punishments Shepards attackers did life imprisonment for first-degree murder didnt seem so remote. This wasnt the way things played out in court. Gwens killers received second-degree murder convictions of 15 years to life, while their accomplices were convicted of manslaughter and given six- and eleven-year sentences. (In contrast, Shepards attackers each got two consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole.) Even the prosecutor who secured the convictions in Gwens case, Chris Lamiero, said afterward: I would not further ignore the reality that Gwen made some decisions in her relation with these defendants that were impossible to defend. I dont think most jurors are going to think its OK to engage someone in sexual activity knowing they assume you have one sexual anatomy when you dont. In other words, Gwen was culpable simply for having sex as a trans woman who has not had bottom surgery. Even when I and other trans women give myriad reasons for why upfront disclosure is not always practical the way it puts us in a position to either risk widespread ridicule or be expected to remain largely celibate many people still believe that its our responsibility to disclose. Its our responsibility to give people we barely know information that can cause us great harm, and if we dont tell them and they find out anyway, any potential violence is our fault for not telling them.  View this image   I would like to think, in 2015, that trans women are in a better place. The trans panic defense is banned in California, in part because of the legacy of Gwen Araujo, but its still legal in the rest of the country. More than 20 trans women have been killed this year in the U.S., almost all women of color, while violence against gay men has significantly diminished. What began as confidence in a legal system that could fairly try Gwens killers has, since her death, become nothing but doubt. Shepard and Araujo may have been directly compared to each other in 2002, but in 2015, the enormous differences in their positions have come to light. Many people who think gay people shouldnt be harmed just for acting gay or demonstrating affection in public still think trans women are at least partly at fault for expressing our gender whenever we are harmed. And because people continue to think this, trans women are still put in a position where violence against us is our own responsibility. No case illustrates this better than that of CeCe McDonald, who accepted a plea bargain in 2012 and spent nearly two years in a mens prison for killing a transphobic attacker in self-defense, because she was afraid that a jury would convict her simply because she was walking around in the world as a trans person. But at least McDonald lived. For trans women and gender-nonconforming femmes who have died, and for the thousands of others who experience harassment and violence on a daily basis, the harm to our bodies and our psyches is the price we pay for being who we are. And as far as weve come, Trans Day of Remembrance today, Nov. 20 is still important: In the 13 years since Gwen Araujos death, we continue to live with the same ignorance and danger that cost that young trans woman of color her life, have claimed the lives of many others, and stand to claim the lives of many more. This is why we must remember, and fight. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .  Tagged:transgender, gwen araujo, tdor, trans panic Hey!

aS"Now listen Im the father of two daughters, and the idea that the federal government is coming in saying that boys, with all the god-given equipment of boys, can be in the shower room with junior high girls this is lunacy! View this image  Joe Raedle / Getty Images During an appearance on conservative radio show Louder With Crowder, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz addressed transgender rights saying it was lunacy for the federal government to mandate that boys with all the god-given equipment of boys share a shower room with school-aged girls. Cruz was talking about Islamic extremism during his appearance posted online Thursday, when host Steven Crowder pivoted to the issue of genetically proper pronouns. Well listen, senator I dont mean to say youre out of touch, because youre dealing with it politically, but were talking about a generation of people who get offended if you use the genetically proper pronouns, said Crowder. So getting to the point of calling something Islamic terrorism is a little further down the trail. Look, these guys are so nutty that the federal government is going after school districts, trying to force them to let boys shower with little girls, Cruz replied. Now listen: Im the father of two daughters, and the idea that the federal government is coming in saying that boys, with all the god-given equipment of boys, can be in the shower room with junior high girls this is lunacy! And I bet you there are a whole lot of parents particularly parents of daughters that are not eager to have the federal government saying Guess what? Your daughter has to shower with a boy, if he wants to be in there, added the senator. Cruz added later in the interview, You know, the funny thing is, my five-year-old knows theres a difference between boys and girls. And yet modern Leftists cant figure that out.

aS"The prominent feminist academic delivered a lecture at Cardiff University despite protests and a petition. View this image  The feminist academic and writer has consistently stated she doesnt believe transgender women are actually women, regardless of whether or not they have undergone gender transition. Recently, Greer referred to Caitlyn Jenner as he/she and accused the prominent transgender reality TV star of merely wanting the limelight enjoyed by the female Kardashians. In the lecture at Cardiff, titled Women and Power: Lessons from the 20th Century, Greer did not discuss transgender issues. However, in the following Q&A, she was asked about whether views such as hers harm transgender people. I dont believe a woman is a man without a cock, she said. You can beat me over the head with a baseball bat. It still wont make me change my mind. Being a woman is a bit tricky. If you didnt find your pants full of blood when you were 13, theres something important about being a woman you dont know. View this image  Taz Rahman, Photographer / @amonochromdream / amonochromedream.com Protest organiser Payton Quinn told The Independent that little had been done to challege Greer in her anti-transgender opinions through the years. Germaine Greer has been, for 20 years, using violent language against trans people, especially trans women, Quinn said. But theres been very little done to challenge her. We oppose her speaking here unchallenged. Interviewed trans-activists, students, & locals outside #GermaineGreer lecture. Here is their leaflet of quotes: Police and security staff were stationed at the event. In the lead-up to the lecture, just over 3,000 people signed a petition calling for Greer to be banned from speaking and describing her views on transgender people as hateful. Trans-exclusionary views should have no place in feminism or society, read the petition, organised by Cardiff University Union womens officer Rachael Melhuish. Hosting a speaker with such problematic and hateful views towards marginalised and vulnerable groups is dangerous. In response to the campaign, Cardiff University vice chancellor Colin Riordan said there was no case for withdrawing a distinguished and exceptional academic speaker such as Greer on the basis that she has voiced opinions that are offensive to others.

aS" James Bradfield worked the graveyard shift at a factory that built airplane parts in Jackson, Mississippi. It was a new job and he didnt like the hours. Hed previously worked for a company that made radiators, but the company went out of business and Bradfield had to take the next job he could find. And so he was tired on the morning of June 26, 2011, when the detective arrived at his home and told him that Craig Anderson, his partner for 18 years, had died. Hed been hit by a truck, the detective said. Bradfield felt his body go frozen, his mind go blank, his stomach drop. He thought about their 4-year-old son, DeMariouz, and he realized that he did not know what to say to him. He called his mother and his pastor, Rev. Terry Davis, and they rushed over. The four of them sat down in the living room. Bradfield tried to hold back his tears. Davis turned to DeMariouz, Bradfield recalled, and asked him if he remembered hearing about heaven at church. DeMariouz nodded. Thats where Craigs gone to heaven, Davis said. He gone to heaven? Why he gone to heaven? DeMariouz said. The Lord said he wanted him to go to heaven. Im gon miss him. Why he have to go like that? I didnt get to say goodbye to him. DeMariouz began crying. Bradfield couldnt hold his tears back any longer, and they hugged and sobbed. The next few days were a blur, and Bradfield said relatives later told him that during those days, he seemed in a trance, zoned out, as he made Andersons final arrangements. He went to the courthouse and met with District Attorney Robert Shuler Smith, who explained to him how Anderson had died. The suspects had confessed. Witnesses had given statements. A security camera captured footage You dont want to see it, a detective told him. Bradfield, 44 at the time, learned the horrible truth this was no accident. The suspects were teenagers. They were white. They had attacked Anderson because he was black. They had taken pleasure in his suffering. The young man who killed him had celebrated his death. This was not simply a murder. This was a lynching. View this image  Craig Anderson and James Bradfield Courtesy James Bradfield Nearly 5,000 people, most of them black, were lynched in the United States between 1882 and 1968, about 500 of them in Mississippi. More than simply murders, these were political killings, tacitly endorsed or ignored by authorities, designed to strike fear into those who might question white supremacy. The lynching of Craig Anderson echoed a brutal and violent form of racism that many locals had thought long gone. Yet here it was manifested in a group of teenagers born more than two decades after the civil rights era. What disturbed so many people was the ages of the kids, said Charles Bolton, a history professor at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro who has written extensively about 19th- and 20th-century Mississippi. These kids had supposedly grown up in this integrated generation. Instead they had shown that sons and daughters had inherited the sins of their parents and grandparents. The seeds were sown somewhere, said Jody Owens, managing attorney for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which has an office in Jackson, Mississippi. You are raised to develop this. Where did these kids learn this? Its not just an idea its a culture. Its a culture that bursts into public view with each instance of white supremacist violence: In the United States, white supremacist terrorists have caused more deaths (31) than jihadis have since 9/11 (26), according to the nonpartisan New America Foundation. Over the four years following Andersons death, Bradfield would have to cope with the particular type of pain, confusion, and despair that had been common for black Americans for generations. The murder of the man he loved had become a public symbol of Mississippis ongoing struggle to wash away the blood staining its history, of the tensions that lingered between the sins of Americas past and the ideals it aimed to fulfill. To Bradfield, though, it was a private grief. Nobody else could understand what I lost, he said. They took everything from me. That was everything. At the arraignment of Deryl Dedmon, the 18-year-old charged with murder, the judge set bail at $50,000, which meant Dedmon needed only $5,000 to walk out of jail. Andersons loved ones were shocked. Some of them gasped and shook their heads. Bradfield went into a rage. This aint right! he shouted. This aint right! And he kept shouting it over and over as the bailiffs pulled him out of the courtroom. Bradfield remembered the stories his father and his grandmother told him about what Mississippi used to be like. His grandmother told him about the years of Jim Crow, the lynchings in the woods, and the burning crosses on lawns. His father told him about separate water fountains and schools, and about how a gang of whites beat and shot Mack Parker before throwing him in the Pearl River for allegedly raping a white woman who was likely attempting to cover up an affair with someone else. Those days felt distant by the time Bradfield was a teenager. He was friendly with his white classmates. He dated a white girl for a few months. He had white neighbors and saw white people at all the places he hung out around town the roller-skating rink, the movie theater, the football games. With each year, he saw fewer and fewer of them, though. Jacksons white residents were fleeing for the suburbs. In the early 1980s, white people made up more than half of Jacksons population. By the mid-90s, the city was nearly 70% black. He lived with his grandmother in north Jackson then. Every few weeks, he drove out to Madison County to visit some family, and on one of those visits, his cousin told him she knew somebody she wanted him to meet. She gave him Craig Andersons phone number, Bradfield called the next morning, and the two met that afternoon. For their first date they drove 45 minutes into Louisiana to buy lottery tickets and then drove 45 minutes back, with nothing but conversation to occupy themselves. They fell for each other that day, and soon they were together every weekend. They made a good pair. Andersons warm demeanor loosened up Bradfield, whose cautious temperament and organized mind kept Anderson in check. They took care of each other. When Bradfield played his regular card games, Anderson fixed him a plate. When Anderson hit the pool halls, Bradfield served him drinks. Anderson cooked Bradfield hearty, delicious meals. Bradfield surprised Anderson with trips out of town, to Chicago, New Orleans, Miami. In those cities, they held hands and kissed in public, which they never felt comfortable doing in Jackson. After three years of dating, Anderson moved in with Bradfield. Two years later, they bought a house. They joined a local church and sang in the choir. It was Bradfields idea to adopt DeMariouz, and at first Anderson was hesitant because he wasnt sure theyd be able to handle a newborn. But from the minute DeMariouz came home with them, he jumped right into being Mr. Mom, Bradfield said. He changed the diapers, bought the clothes, installed the car seat, set up the bassinet, and bought more toys than Bradfield thought their son needed. He spoiled the baby, Bradfield said. When DeMariouz was older and asked if his parents could buy him a candy bar or a stuffed animal, it was Anderson who indulged him while Bradfield played bad cop. Anderson went overboard on Christmas, putting up the lights and ornaments and persuading Bradfield that they should get DeMariouz something big and nice and expensive, like a baby grand piano. By then the men both knew they wanted to spend the rest of their lives together. Mississippi did not recognize same-sex marriage, but Anderson and Bradfield planned their own private ceremony. They drove to New Orleans and during dinner at a restaurant in a hotel on Canal Street, they spoke their vows and exchanged rings. A few months later, Anderson got hired for a job as a production technician at a Nissan plant. The job paid much more than his previous one and he didnt think hed get it. He was jumping around, smiling like it was the best day of his life, Bradfield said. They celebrated with a trip to Memphis. Those were the years when we were like, This is it. We gon like our life. We both got good jobs. We were living real comfortable. We had everything we wanted, Bradfield said. We had the home. We had the child. We go to church, we go to work, we pay our taxes. Go to work and come home to your family thats all you can ask for. The couple planned to celebrate Andersons 48th birthday, on June 30, 2011, with a trip to Chicago. On his way to work on the evening of June 25, Bradfield called to remind Anderson that he should start packing soon. Then he said I love you and headed into the factory. It was the last time they spoke. View this image  Craig Anderson, his cousin, and James Bradfield are seen in this undated handout photo. Courtesy James Bradfield The night Craig Anderson was killed, a group of teenagers gathered for a birthday party on a farm in the suburbs of Jackson. Soon their names would become infamous, but for now they were merely high school students getting drunk around a bonfire on a warm summer night: Deryl Dedmon, John Aaron Rice, Dylan Butler, Kirk Montgomery, Shelbie Richards, Sarah Graves, John Blalack, Jonathan Gaskamp, Robert Rice, Joseph Dominick. Late in the night, Dedmon suggested they go into Jackson to fuck up a nigger, Blalack told police. Blalack said that Dedmon seemed bloodthirsty. Dedmon told his friends that a group of black people had stolen his wallet in Jackson the night before, Montgomery told police. Deryl was upset that he had got robbed in Jackson and he was having girl trouble also, Montgomery said. Richards and Graves tried to persuade others to join. Blalack collected empty beer bottles. They had done this before. At least four times over the previous three months, the teens had terrorized black people in Jackson, a mostly black city they called Jafrica, according to court documents. The first time, Dedmon, Blalack, Robert Rice, John Aaron Rice, Gaskamp, and Montgomery threw beer bottles at black pedestrians, then beat up a drunken black man outside a golf course. The second time, Dedmon, Montgomery, Blalack, Robert Rice, and John Aaron Rice accelerated their Jeep toward a black pedestrian crossing the street, then swerved out of the way at the last moment. The third time, Dedmon, Graves, Richards, Robert Rice, John Aaron Rice, and Montgomery drove into a residential area, rolled down the window, and told a man standing on the corner that they wanted to buy drugs. When the man approached, Blalack punched him in the face and they sped off. The fourth time, Dedmon, Blalack, Dominick, Butler, and Montgomery threw beer bottles at black people they passed on the street. They hit at least one person, who fell to the ground. They then stopped at a sporting goods store, where Blalack bought a slingshot, which they used to shoot metal ball bearings at black people they drove past. On the night of the birthday party, seven of them headed into Jackson. Montgomery drove Butler, John Aaron Rice, and Blalack in his white Jeep. Graves and Richards rode in Dedmons green pickup truck. It was a 15-minute drive into Jackson and Montgomerys group arrived first, just past 4:30 a.m. They threw bottles at homeless black people they passed, then pulled into the parking lot of a motel just off the highway, where they saw Craig Anderson standing beside an orange Chevy Avalanche. Montgomery told Dedmon to meet them there. Rice and Blalack got out of the car and approached Anderson, and Anderson said that he had locked his keys inside his truck. He asked if they had a coat hanger to open the truck. The teens told police that Anderson appeared drunk and that they continued the conversation to stall him until Dedmon arrived. His truck pulled up a few minutes later. Dedmon stepped out and shouted, Nigger, get away from my truck! Rice threw the first punch. Anderson fell to the ground. Dedmon jumped on top of him and punched him in the head repeatedly. I did hear Deryl call him a stupid nigger and he was cussing him while he was hitting him, Butler told police. The barrage lasted about a minute or two. When it was over, Dedmon took Andersons wallet, Blalack and Montgomery told police. Then Rice and Dedmon headed back to their vehicles. Dedmon raised a fist and shouted, White power! and somebody in the Jeep responded, White power! Montgomerys Jeep drove off. View this image  Screen shot of the CCTV footage When he got back into his truck, Dedmon said, Stupid nigger, according to Graves, and then, just as Dedmon was about to turn onto the road, he stopped. In his headlight beams, Dedmon saw Anderson stumbling to his feet at the edge of the parking lot. Dedmon backed up and angled his truck at Anderson. Then he hit the gas, jumped the curb, and ran him over. As the green truck took off down the road, two witnesses at the motel heard the woman in the passengers seat, Richards, shout Fucking nigger! out the window. Montgomery said Dedmon called and told him, I ran that nigger over. The two groups reconvened at a McDonalds around the corner. Dedmon had this big smirk on his face, Montgomery said. Dedmon walked around to the front of his truck. He was looking at it, laughing, Butler said. At least three witnesses had seen the truck hit Anderson. They described the vehicle to police and ran to the victim. One witness, Charlotte Shaw, saw the white Jeep and the green pickup drive past the parking lot on the way back to the highway. Shaw told police, They were pointing and laughing.

Rogelio V. Solis / AP Photo Details of the murder slowly trickled out to the public. Police officers testified, lawyers held press conferences, local news outlets spoke to witnesses, a judge raised Dedmons bail to $800,000, and the Department of Justices Civil Rights Division opened an investigation. Then, on Aug. 8, CNN broadcast the security camera footage showing the beating and the murder, and the story made national headlines. Outrage spread across the country. People were shocked, said Winston Thompson III, the lawyer who represented Andersons family. Weve always had racial issues in Mississippi, but prior to this happening, I never would have thought it would have been that systematic, that pervasive, that virulent: This is what they did for fun. It might not have been so shocking decades before, in the years before white people fled Jackson by the thousands, when white supremacy held the force of law. From 1877 to 1950, 22 people were lynched in Jacksons Hinds County, more than anywhere else in the state, according to a study by the Equal Justice Initiative. In June 1963, a white supremacist shot and killed civil rights activist Medgar Evers in front of his Jackson home. In 1967, Ku Klux Klan members bombed the Congregation Beth Israel synagogue in Jackson and two months later bombed the home of its rabbi, who had been a vocal supporter of the civil rights movement. Racist aggression was a constant in those years, and locals recalled white people driving past Jackson State University, a historically black school, shouting slurs at students. Andersons murder revealed that the racist violence from those years had not completely vanished in the decades since. Yet the community refused to be terrorized. In mid-August, around 500 people marched through the city and gathered for a vigil in the parking lot where Anderson died. We are here to unify, one leader declared. Later that month, activists from Atlanta organized a rally at the crime scene: Maybe it sounds crazy, but we want to forgive what he did, one of the them said to the crowd. In September, Andersons sister, Barbara Anderson Young, sent District Attorney Smith a letter on behalf of her family asking that he not seek the death penalty for Dedmon: We also oppose the death penalty because it historically has been used in Mississippi and the south primarily against people of color for killing whites. Executing [Andersons] killers will not help balance the scales. James Bradfield did not take part in the letter. He did not attend the vigil or the rally. He did not support the tone of racial reconciliation. He stayed away from the news. He only wanted to escape it all.

Solis / AP Photo Bradfield spent his days in bed crying. He kept the lights off and the shades down. He stopped going to work and he stopped going to church. He rarely left the house and some days didnt leave his bedroom. I guess I took myself from society, he said. His son went to live with Bradfields mother. She came over to make Bradfield sandwiches, but he had no appetite hed lose more than 50 pounds in those first several months after Andersons death. The story was everywhere, it seemed. News stations played the footage over and over, hed heard, and he feared accidentally switching onto a channel that was showing it. He didnt want to see it. Still, he often thought about Andersons death. He wondered what Anderson had thought about in his final moments and how much pain he had felt. He lost his faith in God because God had allowed Anderson to be alone that night. I kept asking myself why he had to be by himself, he said. I should have been there. I always had protected him. That was my job. Now Bradfield worried about protecting himself. I was scared, he said. I thought some of those other guys would come and get me. He bought a gun, got a license to carry, and learned to shoot. Some nights he would stare into space and shake with fear. Even DeMariouz could sense it. One night, when the boy was at Bradfields house, he said, Daddy, Ima protect you. They not gonna get you. It seemed to Bradfield that DeMariouz was coping better than he was. He didnt cry as often as Bradfield did. He didnt ask anymore questions about Andersons death. He barely even mentioned Anderson at all. But Bradfield thought about the big dreams Anderson had had for DeMariouz, and he agonized over whether those dreams were still possible. Anderson had hoped DeMariouz would one day go to Ole Miss, and he was adamant that they send him to private school, and at the end of first grade DeMariouz had impressed his parents with all As and Bs on his report card. With Anderson gone, though, Bradfield couldnt afford the tuition on his own. Before the start of DeMariouzs second-grade school year, he transferred him from his private school to public school. A few months into the school year, DeMariouzs report card showed Ds and Fs. I felt like I let Craig down, Bradfield said. Every day brought fresh reminders about the life with Anderson he had lost a life they had planned to spend in the house they bought together a decade earlier. It had three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a big backyard, and a breakfast nook and sat on a small hill draped with 40-foot-tall trees. View this image  The home that Craig Anderson and James Bradfield bought together. Courtesy James Bradfield When they first saw it, Bradfield told Anderson that he thought it was ugly. But Craig saw something in it, he said, and over the months and years, Anderson fixed it up. Put in a new floor, redid the kitchen, painted the walls, planted a garden, built a garage and a screen-room patio. Anderson picked out all the furniture and decorated the whole place himself. The green carpet, the gold lamp in the living room, the painting of tigers, the mahogany clock, the chairs on the patio they all got Bradfield thinking about Anderson now, and every day Bradfield felt a thick knot in his stomach and his cheeks swollen from crying. The days blended into each other, like in a nightmare, Bradfield said. It felt like it wasnt real and I was just going through the motions. One afternoon, Bradfield was driving DeMariouz to Bradfields mothers house, when DeMariouz suddenly said, You cant go that way. Thats where Dedmon killed Craig. And Bradfield, startled, looked around and there, indeed, was the motel parking lot. How you know that? he asked his son. I saw it on TV. Years later, Bradfield remembered the moment the reality of Andersons death hit him. He went to Walmart to buy a gift for DeMariouz a few weeks before Christmas. I just walked in and all I could do was cry, he said. I couldnt do it. I couldnt accept that I had to do it on my own. He watched the security footage of the murder shortly after that, seven or eight months after June 26. He thought it would help him accept the reality and move forward. He watched it once and never again. He still rarely left the house and still spent most of his days in bed crying. The hardest days that first year were the days of the court hearings, he said. There were many hearings because authorities had built up many separate cases. The District Attorneys office had a murder case against Dedmon and an assault case against John Aaron Rice. The Department of Justice charged all 10 teenagers with civil rights violations for the attacks on Anderson and the anonymous victims from their other four admitted trips into Jackson. Federal prosecutors split the 10 defendants across four cases, which meant a total of six cases to follow and attend. We had to keep replaying the same incident over and over, Bradfield said. Before some hearings, prosecutors asked him if he was willing to speak on the witness stand. He declined each time. He didnt think he could make it through without becoming overwhelmed by tears. And so he sat at the far end of the courtroom bench and watched. He looked at the white people on the benches across the aisle. Some of them were crying. Some of them shook their heads and wore sad, anguished expressions. Bradfield tried his best to look away. I hated to sit there and see the look on their faces, he said. Looking at the faces of their parents, the only thing that was going through my mind was All of yall are damn racists. There was so so much anger in me. They were acting like they wanna cry and I look at them like, What the hell you crying for? View this image  Family members of Deryl Dedmon cry as he is sentenced to two concurrent life sentences after pleading guilty to murder and committing a hate crime, March 21, 2012, in Hinds County Circuit Court in Jackson, Mississippi. Rogelio V. Solis / AP Photo Deryl Dedmon and most of the other defendants lived in Brandon, a suburb 15 miles east of Jackson. A white-flight town, history professor Bolton called it. Brandon is around 80% white and signs around town boast of its school districts A+ rating. The teenagers reflected the economic spectrum of the town and the surrounding suburbs: Dedmon lived in a big brick house on a cul-de-sac in a subdivision with grassy medians between the lanes; Butlers mother lived in an apartment complex whose residents were predominantly black; Blalack and Dominick lived in a winding residential neighborhood with sloping two-car driveways; John Aaron Rice lived in a trailer that sat next door to a two-story house with a jungle gym in the yard on a narrow, rocky street; Graves lived a 30 minute-drive from town, in a wooden trailer tucked behind a thicket of trees up a slope from a secluded country road. The defendants and their families declined interview requests for this story. John Aaron Rice told BuzzFeed News he would answer questions only in exchange for money. Kirk Montgomery and Joseph Dominick offered brief comments. I lost my freedom, family, and everything else for a crime I didnt commit, Montgomery said. Right now in society, were in the most volatile times with racism, Dominick said. But Ive changed. Its been a different experience in [prison]. Most of the black guys in here know what Im in for but they still love me. In court, the teenagers and their supporters denied they were racists. Richards told the court she followed a lot of people with hate in their hearts. Graves said that she was a teenager who partied too much and wanted to fit in with the crowd. In a letter to the court, her friend, who noted that she was engaged to a black man, wrote that Graves babysat my mixed son for me many times and he always came back happy. A family friend testifying for Blalack said that he lacked a great deal of self-esteem and wanted to fit in. John Aaron Rice said in court, I wasnt a racist. I wasnt ever raised or taught any of that. Butler, who had a black uncle and a black stepdad, said, I was never raised to have a hatred for African-Americans. View this image  John Louis Blalack enters the federal courthouse in Jackson, Mississippi, Jan. 7, 2012. Rogelio V. Solis / AP Photo Most of them cited drunken judgment, youthful foolishness, and peer pressure as their explanations for joining the rides into Jackson. As a neighbor of one defendant explained, Some kids acted like they were racist because it was the popular thing to do in some groups. Like theyd have black friends and theyd never say the n-word around them, but then when theyre with their white friends, its different. In police and court statements, the other teenagers pointed to Dedmon as the source of racist peer pressure. At a press conference organized by the Anderson familys lawyer, a white local pastor recounted that he had warned Brandon Police about Dedmon after he bullied his son. The pastors son told news outlets that Dedmons crew picked fights with kids who had black friends and that when Barack Obama was elected president, Dedmon wrote on Facebook, no niggers for president. A convenience store manager told a local paper that Dedmon and his friends once entered his store, saw a group of Jackson State fans, and said, Wow, looks like niggers are taking over Brandon. Southern Poverty Law Center attorney Jody Owens said that his offices investigation into the case discovered that Dedmon had relatives who were members of white supremacist groups. When Dedmon pleaded guilty to the state murder charges in March 2012, he said, I was young. I was dumb. I was ignorant. And then he echoed the same refrain as most of his fellow defendants: I was not raised the way that I acted that night. That refrain reflected an idea that resonated across Brandon: This was an isolated circle of racist aggression and did not emerge from a deeper culture of racism. Shelbie Richardss boyfriend, who identified himself only as Bradley, said that the media coverage of the murder ignited racial divides that did not previously exist in the area. The news coverage was about trying to bring racism back, he said. This kind of stuff is what brings racism into the world. I dont see the point in saying anything about race or involving race. It just makes blacks hate whites and whites hate blacks all the more. View this image  This is an undated mug shot released by the Madison County Sheriffs Department of Sarah Graves. Madison County Sheriff's Department / AP Photo The racism present was not the public and proud strain common in Americas past. This was racism clouded by denial and shame. Sarah Graves mother, Mary Miles Harvey, wrote a letter to the court saying that she didnt raise her daughter to be a racist. At Graves sentencing hearing, Judge Harvey Wingate called Harvey to the witness stand to ask her about the letter. He noted that Graves had told investigators that when her and her brothers rooms were messy, Harvey would tell them they were living like niggers. Harvey denied saying that. I would have said Negroes, not niggers, she said. I just meant that their rooms were nasty, like a pigsty. Wingate asked her what she thought the word nigger meant. An ignorant, nasty person, Harvey said. I was taught in school that a nigger was a nasty person, and a Negro was a black person. After a year, Bradfield repainted the house, cut down five trees in the front yard, ripped out the carpet and polished the hardwood underneath, replaced the wallpaper, and sold all the furniture and bought a new set. After a year and a half, he went back to work and took DeMariouz back in to live with him. After two years, he took off his wedding ring and placed it in the jewelry box in his bedroom. He returned to the day-to-day routine he once had. He was not healed, but the responsibilities of work and child care taught him to bear the pain. Life had gone on over those months hed spent crying in bed with the shades down and the lights off and there were mortgage, credit card, and car payments to make. The life he and Anderson had built with their dual incomes he now had to support with one. He could not. In 2014, he filed for bankruptcy. The court appearances continued. By January 2015, all 10 defendants had pleaded guilty to the federal hate crime charges. In February, Judge Carlton Reeves was to hand down the sentence for three of them Deryl Dedmon, who had already been sentenced to life in prison for his state conviction, John Aaron Rice, and Dylan Butler. Bradfield did not want to get out of bed that morning and he clung tightly to his covers. Long after his alarm had sounded, he got up and showered. He brushed his teeth. He put on his nicest blue jeans, black leather loafers, and a white pinstripe dress shirt with silver cufflinks. Then he fell face first onto his bed and sobbed. I just felt like I couldnt go through it anymore, he said. I was just so tired. The prosecutors had asked Bradfield if he wanted to speak at this hearing and he told them he wouldnt be able to. He gave them a written statement instead, and he silently watched Andersons sister, Barbara, step up to the witness stand. She had served as the face of Andersons family from the start. She had given speeches and signed her name to letters. She had been strong and poised through these four years, and when she addressed the three young white men in orange jumpsuits in the federal courthouse, her voice was sharp and forceful. The Anderson family forgives, as Christians should, she said. We refuse to bear the burden of hate because it is such, such a heavy load to carry. We will leave it to our father in heaven to repay you all. May God have mercy on your sin and sick souls. View this image  Barbara Anderson Young, sister of James Craig Anderson, reads a statement as Hinds County Circuit Court Judge Jeff Weill Sr., looks on, March 21, 2012, in Jackson. Rogelio V. Solis / AP Photo But Bradfield could not forgive. He felt it was unfair for anybody to expect him to. I hate them, he told BuzzFeed News. I hope I do get over this, the anger part. But every time I have to think back to that day, that day when the detective told me he was killed, and I have to relive that all over again, that anger rises up. When Andersons sister finished speaking, a federal prosecutor stood up to read Bradfields statement. My heart gets so heavy at times because I feel like a failure because I couldnt keep up on the things Craig did for us, he said. I wish none of you would ever see daylight again. There is no room on Earth for people like you. The defendants spoke next. They said sorry and asked for forgiveness. They said they had changed. And when they finished, Judge Reeves prepared to read his sentencing statement. Usually defendants stood to hear their sentences, but this statement is a little long, Reeves said, and he asked them to sit. Reeves had lived through a changing Mississippi. His generation was born into the center of the states struggle between, as history professor Bolton calls it, Old Mississippi and New Mississippi. Reeves grew up in Yazoo City, in the Delta, and in the early 1970s he was part of his elementary schools first integrated class. While at law school at the University of Virginia in 1993, he saw a flier for a fraternity party that stated, No Jews, No Wops, and No Nigga Babes. In 2010, President Obama appointed him to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, making him the second black federal judge in the states history. Reeves seat had once been held by Harold Cox, a segregationist who was known to call black people baboons from the bench. Twenty-seven years after Coxs final day in the courtroom, Reeves looked down from that bench at three young white men convicted of lynching a black man. There is something different about Mississippi, Reeves said, quoting historian Anthony Walton, something almost unspeakably primal and vicious; something savage unleashed there that has yet to come to rest. He spoke of the states bloody history and read the names of some of those who had been lynched. The lynching of Craig Anderson, Reeves told the courtroom, ripped off the scab of the healing scars of Mississippi, causing her, our Mississippi, to bleed again. View this image  Judge Carlton W. Reeves Courtesy Cleoinc The sadness of this day also has an element of irony to it, Reeves said. The three white defendants had committed their crimes in a city with a black district attorney and a black mayor; had been escorted into the court by agents who worked for a black U.S. marshal; had been prosecuted by lawyers working for a black U.S. attorney under an office led by a black U.S. attorney general; were being sentenced by a black federal judge; and would be sent into a federal prison system headed by a black director. In order to continue that progress, Reeves suggested to the courtroom, the state had to recognize the blood in its soil. See, today we take another step away from Mississippis tortured past, Reeves said. We move farther away from the abyss. Indeed, Mississippi is a place and a state of mind. And those who think they know about her people and her past will also understand that her story, our Mississippi story, has not been completely written. Deryl Dedmon received 50 years for the federal charge on top of his life sentence on the state charge. John Aaron Rice was sentenced to 18 years and Dylan Butler was sentenced to six and a half years. The other seven defendants awaited their turns. Two weeks later, Reeves sentenced the second set of defendants. James Bradfield arrived before the courtroom doors were unlocked. A dozen or so white people huddled outside the door. A few of them complained about the job the defense lawyers did in defending their children. Bradfield sat on a bench down the hall from the crowd with his head in his hands. After the courtroom doors opened, he waited for the rest of the people to file in and find seats and then he entered and took his place at the far right edge of the courtroom. He wore a pink shirt and brown leather shoes. He was not crying. Montgomery, Gaskamp, and Dominick shuffled in. Bradfield did not look at them. A few minutes into the hearing, Barbara Anderson Young took the witness stand and spoke about her brother and his death as she had in previous hearings. When she finished, Bradfield stood up. He walked slowly past the defendants, lowered himself into the chair on the stand, and then turned toward them. He had not prepared a statement. He told the three young men that they had taken away the man he loved, the father of his child, a gentle and good man. He told them he would never recover from what they did and that he hated them for what they did. He began to tear up, but he did not cry. He didnt feel sorry for them, he said, and he didnt forgive them. Then he stood, marched past them, down the aisle, and out the door. He sat on the bench in the hallway and sobbed. Inside the courtroom, Reeves sentenced Montgomery to 18 years in prison and Gaskamp and Dominick to four years. By the end of April, the last of the defendants had been sentenced and the long process was finished. John Louis Blalack was sentenced to 20 years in prison, Robert Rice to 10 years, Shelbie Richards to eight years, and Sarah Graves to five years. The court process had worn on Bradfield and he was relieved when it ended. Now I can start trying to live my life, he said. Now I can start trying to have a life. Every time I would go to court, it would wake up all that anger and bitterness. It was hard to keep afloat. The state had moved on from the lynching of Craig Anderson, and Bradfield hoped to as well. The pain, he said, had not dulled over the years. He had only gotten better at living with it. In his head, throughout the day, he pictured an alternate reality with Anderson. When Bradfield woke up, he imagined Anderson lightly shaking his shoulders, pleading with him to get out of bed and get ready because they were running late. When he poured his coffee, he saw Anderson out on the porch smoking a cigarette. View this image  Courtesy James Bradfield It was not enough to imagine Anderson, though. Bradfield had to fill the hole left in his absence. He had to serve as both parents for DeMariouz the disciplinarian he had always been and also the softer, lenient pushover Anderson had been. When he spoiled DeMariouz he reminded him that he was only buying the toy because Anderson wanted him to. DeMariouz had stopped talking about Anderson, and Bradfield feared that his son would lose all memories of him. On the four-year anniversary of Andersons death, Bradfield took DeMariouz to the cemetery where he was buried. They stood on the gravesite and DeMariouz placed a bouquet of flowers in the bronze holder above the headstone. DeMariouz, why you dont talk about Craig anymore? Bradfield said. Daddy, you know why I dont talk about Craig. No, I dont. Tell me why. Cause if I talk about Craig you gon cry and I dont want you to cry and Craig dont want you to cry.

aS"Human Rights Campaigns new corporate equality index takes international operations into account for the first time. View this image  Nabil Al-jurani / AP  Companies doing business in countries with harsh anti-LGBT laws are among the top scorers in the Human Rights Campaigns first ever corporate LGBT scorecard to consider international operations alongside domestic ones. On Wednesday, HRC will launch its 14th annual Corporate Equality Index, which scores hundreds of companies on measures like health insurance coverage for transgender workers and employee benefits for employees same-sex partners. To highlight the new international measures, HRC President Chad Griffin is scheduled to travel to Mexico City on Thursday for a global launch event partly sponsored by the U.S. Embassy and including companies such as Dow, IBM, and American Express. Today, businesses no longer reserve basic workplace fairness for part of their workforce, but are instead making protections on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity consistent across their global operations, Griffin writes in the introduction to the report. This is not only a great step forward for the LGBT movement, but for the entire world. Only one area that employers were scored on this year actually applied to work overseas: whether the company has a nondiscrimination policy covering LGBT workers that applies throughout its global operations. Some of the companies that met this requirement have operations in countries that not only make same-sex relationships or wearing non-gender conforming clothing illegal, but actively seek out LGBT people for arrest, have extreme jail sentences or flogging as penalties, or criminalize support for LGBT rights. In such countries, invoking a companys nondiscrimination protections might require LGBT employees to out themselves to company officers in a way that could expose them to arrest or extortion. That could mean policies on paper have little effect on the ground, or might force companies into difficult confrontations with local governments. The most striking examples may be the oil companies Shell and Chevron, both of which get perfect scores in this years report. Both have extensive operations in Nigeria, which passed a law in early 2014 that made it a crime even to support LGBT rights or engage in public displays of affection with someone of the same sex, with punishments of up to 14 years in prison. Both companies also do business in Saudi Arabia, where homosexuality is routinely punished by flogging and a school was recently fined $25,000 for being painted with rainbows authorities reportedly described them as emblems of homosexuality. Shell and Chevron did not answer questions on the record about the implementation of nondiscrimination policies in these places. But Deena Fidas, director of HRCs Workplace Equality Program, said even if these policies dont rapidly translate to a better situation for LGBT workers in hostile countries, they are an important starting point. Our team would be the first to admit that policy doesnt equal practice, Fidas told BuzzFeed News. This doesnt mean that its sunshine and roses globally in terms of the LGBT worker, but we need to start with this first step. Support for LGBT policies has already brought at least one other company highly ranked in the index into conflict with governments where it operates. In 2014, the investment bank Goldman Sachs clashed with a cabinet minister in Singapore which criminalizes homosexuality for hosting an LGBT student recruiting event. The minister said the country is a largely conservative society and that foreign companies here should respect local culture and context. In 2012, Goldmans Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein also said the bank had lost a client due to its support for LGBT rights. Large banks and other corporations whose business centered primarily in major cities like law and consulting firms tended to score most highly in the report. Companies working with natural resources tended to perform poorly. ExxonMobil is one of the most closely watched, because it opposed calls to introduce LGBT protections until President Barack Obama issued an executive order last year requiring such provisions from federal contractors. This year the company scored only 40%, among the lowest of any major corporation. HRCs Fidas said the organization planned to incrementally expand its criteria in the coming years to place more emphasis on global operations. The hardest criteria to apply globally, she suggested, would be equalizing health care benefits for LGBT employees and their partners, since many national health care systems are not under an employers control as they are in the U.S. The next step, she said, would likely be to encourage companies to provide support for LGBT employee groups abroad. Such groups have been important tools for promoting broader policy changes within corporations. In a statement accompanying the report Fidas said a true culture of inclusion wont be achieved until companies turn inclusive policies into everyday practice across their organizations.

aS"Ive been pretty good over the years with separating my two lives: my skiing mindset and my personal life. Following his ESPN cover, the U.S. Olympian is ready to reconcile his two lives at last. View this image  Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News U.S. Olympic freeskier Gus Kenworthys favorite part of competition is not being upside down, midgravity-defying stunt: Its actually the moments just before and just after. Theres never really another moment in my everyday life where I feel so emotional, 24-year-old Kenworthy told BuzzFeed News. This crazy culmination of feelings thats going on in your stomach. Its almost nauseating and it can be nauseating I sometimes throw up when I get really nervous. The building of suspense, the seconds that drag on like years, and the relief of a safe touchdown these are all feelings Kenworthy has experienced lately, even when he was nowhere near fresh snow. During the 2014 Sochi Olympics, crowds congratulated Kenworthy on his silver medal and heroic puppy rescue, unaware that the athlete was busy wrestling with a larger secret. Last month when he appeared on the cover of ESPN The Magazine, Kenworthy finally touched down from a leap he had been working toward since he was 5 years old coming out as gay. On Dec. 10, the freestyle skier will return to the Winter Dew Tour as the defending champion of Slopestyle, but everything will feel like a first his first competition since recovering from a serious injury (surgery for a break in his femur last March), and his first appearance as an out skier. BuzzFeed caught up with Kenworthy over the phone after strolling around New York City with him just a week earlier to discuss how it feels to have landed one of the biggest jumps of his life and what challenges are up next. Its been a few weeks now since your ESPN cover. How have you been doing since the big day? View this image  Photographed in New York City on Nov. 3, 2015 Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News GK: Its been a crazy couple of weeks since the cover came out. It hasnt really been as shocking, maybe, as people thought it was going to be? I feel like it has been really comfortable, allowing me to be who I want to be and be who I always have been. I think I kind of lived in a perpetual fear of outing myself always making sure I was doing the right thing to stay in the closet and keep people from wondering or assuming anything that I wasnt ready to let them know. Its been really nice to be able to be really open, transparent, and honest. Its been weird to suddenly talk about my sexuality, something that I havent ever really been very vocal about. Its a little bit new, I guess, and crazy to be in [this] position? I dont ever want to feel like Im selling out my sexuality. But it has been amazing to get that weight off my chest and just finally be able to talk about it. I hope that Im helping and inspiring kids to be themselves and be comfortable and honest, not feel ashamed or feel like they have to hide anything which I know is easier said than done. But I hope that thats kind of the point thats coming across with the interviews Im doing. A lot of coming out, for me, is sort of when I already did it to my agent, my friends, and my family. When I did it publicly it was more to inspire change in opinions and battle intolerance. You mentioned in the past how difficult it can be to come out when youre in the world of action sports. How have your fellow athletes reacted? GK: I think Ive been surprised its been a good surprised. Theres been a little bit of mixed feedback, but overall I think people are genuinely happy for me. I think most of the people Ive grown up skiing with, and that I compete with they didnt know at all. Because of that, I wasnt sure how people were going to react, but [overall they have] been supportive. I got a lot of tweets of encouragement, texts from friends, and calls. It made me feel good. I wasnt sure if that was going to be the reaction because of what the industry is and what the sport is the image that it projects and the way that sometimes people talk. I was pleasantly surprised. View this image  Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News In the ESPN story, you said that you never got to be proud of what you did in Sochi because you were closeted. What would you tell yourself at Sochi if you could go back in time? GK: I think I would have told myself not to get hung up on the fact that I wasnt out yet because in a way it would have been very comforting to be out in that scenario, to be able to talk honestly and openly throughout those interviews and in that media onslaught that pursued the Olympics. In hindsight, I dont think I would have changed anything. I dont think I was ready to come out then. I think that even though it was a struggle, those few weeks and that month of media, the games, and everything? I think that was actually a turning point for me where I realized I did want to come out and I realized how important it was to me that I couldnt continue this charade any longer. I wouldnt have changed that because it was a critical moment in my life. I think its important that I had the time to talk to my family and close friends these people that are so directly involved in my life to tell them first and have that open discussion so that they werent blindsided. I think had I done something at the Olympics or after it would have been such a shock to them. I dont think it would have necessarily been the best move. Im glad I got to tell them in my own time. View this image  Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Coming out was such a huge hurdle for you personally now that youve had the big moment, whats your next goal? GK: Now that Ive had this big weight taken off my shoulders, I think the next thing I want to do is really focus on my skiing and the sport. Ive always had my mind being pulled in two different ways this internal battle going on. Its hard to give my skiing my complete focus, so Im looking forward to skiing uninhibited. The next Olympics is my next hurdle, though its a few years away. How do you think it will feel to get up at your next competition and perform completely and authentically as yourself? GK: I think thats going to be such an amazing feeling. Ive been pretty good over the years with separating my two lives: my skiing mindset and my personal life, my love life and everything else. Ive been compartmentalizing those different things and it still weighs heavy on me and it weighs heavy on my soul. Its allowed me to be easily distracted because Id be in the mindset to compete and Id be thinking about my run and what Im about to do and Id get distracted. I think having [my sexuality] out there in the open and me being able to feel comfortable and confident will change a lot. Do you have any pre-event rituals when youre competing? View this image  Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News GK: The events that are less important to me I dont get very nervous for. I can eat a good breakfast, stretch, and feel good. In the contests that I put more emphasis on, in my own mind, I sometimes get really nervous so I have a hard time eating breakfast that day. Its more just me trying to calm my nerves breathing and visualizing it, trying to be mellow and preserve as much energy as I can until I need it. I dont really have any superstitions, I dont wear one kind of underwear or anything like that. Whats your favorite thing about competing? GK: My favorite part of competing is actually the moment right before I compete and then right after I compete. Its the buildup before an event and the feeling you get before youre going into your competition run, the mix of excitement and nervous energy. This crazy culmination of feelings thats going on in your stomach, its almost nauseating and it can be nauseating I sometimes throw up when I get really nervous. I love that feeling. Theres never really another moment in my everyday life where I feel so emotional. Theres just so much going on and then theres the moment right after a competition run when you land a run youre happy with, theres never a better sigh of relief. Its such a crazy feeling to feel like you gave it your all and it went well. That feeling is the kind of the feeling I live for: landing the last jump or that last hit in a half-pipe. I hold my breath almost on the last trick and when I land, I let out everything. Its a good feeling. Do you have advice for athletes, or non-athletes, who are currently closeted and possibly struggling with some of the same emotions you were before coming out? GK: Ive had so many kids reaching out to me in the last few weeks. I try to just tell everyone that it does get better. I know that sounds crazy. Its really difficult being in the closet. Its not fun. Its really scary, and really emotional, and its kind of traumatic. I want to encourage kids absolutely to be themselves and embrace that part of themselves, but I also dont think its my place or anybodys place to tell someone when they should come out or how they should come out. I think its really a personal thing, a personal journey. Its something I kind of wish I had embraced a little sooner. I dont think Ive met anyone who said, Oh man, I wish I had stayed in the closet a little bit longer. Because once you come out you realize how much happier you are and how much weight is off your shoulders, how much less pressure you feel in your everyday life. I would encourage anybody to do it just because that feeling is so great and its such a release. I would want anyone to feel that release. I think its important that people know that the people that do love them and are there for them and are their supporters are still going to be those people, regardless of your sexual orientation. The people that dont feel that way, and arent supportive, and cant come to terms or accept it theyre not really people you need in your life anyway. In a way it can be sad, but it does show you who your true friends are and, in a way, thats kind of beautiful. View this image  Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News What is your favorite event to compete in? GK: The X Games! It hasnt really gone my way its not an event that I always do well at. Theres something about the X Games thats larger than life; it has such a crazy energy. I put a lot of emphasis on it and its really an emotional event for me. Im really looking forward to it and I hope it goes better for me. What are your most used emojis right now? GK: Those girls with the pink sweaters are the ones I use the most, its ridiculous. Do you have a celeb crush? GK: Ill say Matt Bomer. Whats your favorite television show right now? GK: How to Get Away With Murder, for sure. Im not caught up I only started watching it a little while ago, so Im in the first season, but Im definitely hooked. Ideal first date? GK: My ideal first date would be something where you get a lot of time to talk with someone. I dont really understand why people go to shows or movies on a first date. I definitely want to use that time to talk and get to know someone. Maybe meeting for a drink with plans to go to dinner somewhere? So you can get a drink and talk, then walk to dinner. Do you have any automatic dating deal breakers? GK: Oh god, Im sure there are so many. I cant deal with someone who has bad breath, its just the worst. That sounds really shallow but I just couldnt deal with that. I guess really bad manners would be a big turnoff. I dont need someone who is super prim and proper, but, I dont know, I think I would be turned off if someone was a sloppy eater or wasnt genuinely courteous. Also no sense of humor or a bad sense of humor would be a huge turnoff. And someone who cant spell! If we are texting and there are tons of spelling mistakes, I cant deal with that.

aS"New research has revealed that despite gains in legal equality for LGBT people, verbal bullying remains commonplace. LGBT Foundation Stonewall A study of more than 2,000 adults in the UK found that nearly 1 in 5 admitted to having used offensive language against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people in the past year. The research, carried out by Stonewall, the LGBT equality charity, found that 19% of respondents said they had made comments against the LGBT community over the period, while a further 63% nearly two-thirds of those who had heard others use such remarks said they failed to step in to challenge them. Thirty per cent of those surveyed said they had heard homophobic, biphobic, or transphobic comments such as poof or dyke in the last month alone, while 49% had witnessed similar words uttered in the past year. The study found that although nearly a third 31% did intervene when they heard anti-LGBT remarks, only 3% offered support to those on the receiving end of it. And women were twice as likely to confront people making offensive comments to or about LGBT people. Perhaps most telling in the data was how it breaks down according to age. The youngest surveyed 18-24-year-olds were the most likely to use such offensive language (at 32%) but were also the most likely to intervene when hearing abusive remarks (at 42%). By contrast, among people aged 55 and over, 15% admitted to saying anti-LGBT words, but only 24% said they had stepped in when others did. The results of the study, which was conducted by YouGov, have been released during Anti-Bullying Week, a nationwide initiative to challenge bullying in all forms. View this image  Stonewall Stonewall has now launched a campaign called No Bystanders to encourage people who hear derogatory comments towards LGBT people to either challenge the person making them or offer support to the recipient. More than 16,000 people have so far signed up to the initiative, pledging to be brave, be heard and be kind. Were not asking people to step into situations that are dangerous or to put themselves at risk, said Ruth Hunt, the chief executive of Stonewall. Not being a bystander can be simply offering support to someone who has been bullied. Challenging bullying requires courage but it does make a difference. View this image  Stonewall Earlier this year, Joseph Flinders, a gay radio producer from Manchester, posted a Facebook status directed at his younger sisters anti-gay bully, which went viral, as it both challenged the language she was subjected to and championed her. After hearing about the results of Stonewalls survey, he told BuzzFeed News: One in five people: youre almost guaranteed to know someone that makes a comment directed at someone thats fuelled by hate. Thats a shocking ratio of people. More shocking is the fact that more than half of people dont say anything. View this image  Facebook / Joseph Flinders Flinders added: When I was in high school if anything [homophobic] was said to me, rarely did anyone ever step in. As an adult Ive heard homophobic language on the street and no one challenged it. Sometimes it is hard to challenge someone you dont know but if you dont say something to oppose it youre almost agreeing with it. He also believes it is more important to assist the victim: More attention should go to the victim than the perpetrator because you cant force a perpetrator to understand. If a victim of homophobia is shown support thats the burden halved instantly. The more people that show support, the less of an audience homophobes will have. If you dont feel alone, you dont feel as alienated.   Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!  Tagged:bullying, bullying by Sarah A.

aS"BuzzFeed News went to a dance for queer kids and their friends in Adelaide, Australia. View this image  Minus18 Traditionally, school formal night itself pales in comparison to the weeks of anticipation. Thoughts of table configurations, outfits, fake IDs, and, of course, dates cloud the collective psyche of the average graduating class. But for kids who are gay, bisexual, and transgender, such everyday worries easily magnify as they wonder where they fit in this particularly straight mainstay of the high school experience. Consider the transgender girl who has long dreamed of the opportunity to wear a ball gown, but fears ridicule by her peers. Or the out guy who wants to bring his boyfriend from another school, but is met by a hostile administration. For this girl, this guy, and many, many others, the formal can be a minefield of awkward situations and social exclusion. Enter Minus18. A group for LGBTI young people based in Victoria, Minus18 has run several successful formals for queer young people and their friends in Melbourne over recent years. The group has tapped into a market with clear demand numbers at their last Melbourne formal swelled to about 500. And this year, the group took the formal to Adelaide, South Australia. BuzzFeed News was there as a group of 120 nervous teenagers and young people turned up to experience the kind of formal they never got to enjoy at school. View this image  Lane Sainty / BuzzFeed News Jeremy, 19, is a Minus18 volunteer. A bunch of them trekked over from Melbourne to Adelaide, crammed into two cars along with tablecloths, booklets, and other important miscellany. Identifying as a transgender, non-binary person, Jeremy uses the gender-neutral pronoun they. At their all-girls Catholic school in Melbourne, same-sex formal partners werent allowed, and Jeremy felt compelled to hide the fact they are transgender from all but a few close friends. You know how things are in high school, they say. Shit spreads. The experience left them bummed out, Jeremy says but also eager to pitch in and help, so younger kids can have a different experience. Were talking on the stairs just outside the Adelaide Freemasons Hall. Inside, the Minus18 crew are madly tying balloons together and constructing table settings out of glass jars, fairy lights, and glitter, while a playlist titled electronic chill blasts through the sound system. View this image  Margot Fink / Minus18 Its through this productive group of teens and twentysomethings that Jeremy found the words, the confidence, and the resources to come out as transgender to their family. Its a lot for them to take in, but theyre pretty supportive, Jeremy says. Theyre doing the best they can. Is it fair for them to take that time? They still get my name wrong, they still get my pronouns wrong, but I know that they are trying, Jeremy says. And I think thats enough for me. Jeremy adds: I definitely have it a lot better than some of the other people, which is why I wanted to help out tonight. Minus18 Minus18 A couple of hours later, Freemasons Hall is fully decked out gold leaves artfully scattered over the cute table settings, the bar stocked with cans of Solo, Fanta, and Coke, and a pizza catering company set up out the back. Its a classic school formal setting, but as the young people roll in, the queerness of the event becomes clear. Kids stand out, blur the gender binary, do away with the girls-in-dresses-and-heels, boys-in-black-suits mentality. One has a fringe dyed in the colours of the pride flag. Another turns up in a full-length ball gown. Plenty of baby-faced teens are looking dapper in chinos, blazers, bow ties, and suspenders. They all look great. Two quiet boys with matching red roses on their lapels tell me theyre 17, in Year 11, and very excited to be here as they pose for the photo booth. Their hands remain entwined as they barely change their pose for all four flashes of the camera. After theyve picked up their strip, a more boisterous group clamour in front of the tiny screen. Mid-session, a boy rockets up to the group and ebulliently plants an kiss on another boy, holding him and rocking back and forth for at least 10 seconds. No one bats an eyelid. This is going to sound really daggy, but every time we run one of these it takes me back to my first year, says Margot Fink. Margot is 21, and a nominee for the 2016 Young Australian of the Year award for her activism and advocacy within the transgender community. Her first formal with Minus18 was in 2010, when she started working with the organisation and she hasnt looked back. View this image  Lane Sainty / BuzzFeed News I wasnt really out to that many people, and a friend had kind of dragged me along and walked me into that room, with hundreds of other people, she says. Id never been in a space like that before, and I went from being one of a handful of people to part of something massive. Approximately 120 people come to the Adelaide formal making it small by Melbourne standards, but the biggest event for queer youth in Adelaides recent memory. Later, Minus18 regulars tell me the night had a special vibe to it, and some Adelaide youth workers comment that theyve never seen some of the kids so relaxed. Minus18 Minus18 Even for a regular formal, the mood is surprisingly unrestrained particularly given the non-alcoholic bar. The teens hit the dance floor before pizza is even served, bopping along to the tunes of two separate bands. A conga line snakes its way around the room, picking up almost everyone in attendance. When a DJ starts up around 8pm, the stampede to front of the hall is immediate. Instead of a brave group or two venturing out onto the floor to kick off the night, its 100 of them, immediately, jumping up and down as though they are in the moshpit at Stereosonic. There are sweet, quiet moments too. I walk past the quiet couple with red roses on their lapels taking a break on the stairs outside the hall. The shorter one is resting his head on the taller ones shoulder as they murmur quietly about how happy they are to have found one another. When one of the bands breaks out a slow, violin-inspired version of Macklemores Same Love, the dancefloor rapidly transforms to a sea of slow-dancers couples and groups of all shapes, sizes, genders, and outfits swaying gently. View this image  Minus18 But the strangest part of the formal isnt whats there, but whats missing: self-consciousness. It pervades all kinds of teenage social interactions, but particularly the lives of queer kids, who tend to feel as though their very being is something to be ashamed of. The Adelaide formal is a stark reminder that the social awkwardness often accompanying teenage queerness is entirely contextual that when you put those kids in a room where they have nothing to be ashamed of, they stop being ashamed. Thats it. Events like the formal are important to let kids know there is a happy future out there for them, says Margot. For me, growing up, I had no one I could look to, she says. That sucked, because I was like, OK, I can be open with who I am and what I am, but I probably wont be successful in my career, Ill probably lose a bunch of friends, my family might reject me. In hindsight, those werent correct assumptions. But because there was no one I could relate to thats the only thing I could believe. Being able to break that down for other people is huge.

aS"Now we can relax and get old together. A day after it was legally possible for same-sex couples to marry, history was made as two men became the first to tie the knot. View this image  Richard Dowling (left) and Cormac Gollogly, saying I do. Charles Mcquillan / Getty Images Six months after Ireland became the first country in the world to enact same-sex marriage by a vote of the people, two men have married each other in a simple celebration at a community centre. The nuptials, between Richard Dowling and Cormac Gollogly, took place at 8:30am on Tuesday, in Clonmel, County Tipperary, as November rain tipped down outside, the Irish Times reported. View this image  Charles Mcquillan / Getty Images The happy couple had already enjoyed a lavish civil partnership ceremony in September complete with a honeymoon in the Maldives and so opted for a scaled-down event, with no guests and only two women who work in the register office as witnesses. But in order to become the first gay couple to marry in the previously strictly Catholic country, the grooms held the ceremony in a waiting room outside the registrar office at Clonmels HSE Community Care Centre. They signed their historic wedding register on a hospital trolley belonging to the centre. View this image  Charles Mcquillan / Getty Images Gollogly, a barrister from Dublin who has been with Dowling for 12 years, told the Irish Times: We didnt want to detract from the main ceremony and debated what to do. We decided to keep it simple and decided to have lunch with the families in Dublin. He added: This is the icing on the cake. Dowling had proposed to him two years ago, on a beach in Spain as fireworks erupted. View this image  Charles Mcquillan / Getty Images Although the results of the referendum on same-sex marriage were revealed May 23, showing 62% of voters supported the change to the constitution, it has taken six months for the necessary legislative changes in particular the Marriage Act 2015 to be implemented before register offices could begin to officiate same-sex weddings. View this image  Charles Mcquillan / Getty Images Mary-Claire Heffernan, senior registrar for South Tipperary, who conducted the wedding of Dowling and Gollogly as well as their civil partnership ceremony, said before the occasion: They kind of wanted to be the first so they have to do it as early as possiblethey have been planning this for the last two weeks and waiting to see when we could do it. They were finally given the go-ahead Monday after the Marriage Act passed into law, enabling registration procedures. Dowling, who works for a bank, added: We are really delighted to be able to do ithaving a full marriage was important to us so now we can relax and get old together. Heffernan concluded the ceremony by telling the newlyweds: Richard and Cormac are now going to seal their marriage with the giving and receiving of a ring. A ring is an unbroken circle it has no beginning and no end. It symbolises unending and everlasting love and is an outward sign of the lifelong promise that you have made to each other. And then the groom kissed the groom. View this image  Charles Mcquillan / Getty Images  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!  Tagged:ireland, same-sex marriage by Sarah A.

aS'In September, the Alabama Supreme Court held that an adoption granted years earlier in Georgia to a same-sex couple was void. One of the womens lawyers calls the decision glaringly, clearly wrong, and they are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to take up her appeal. View this image  Mark Wilson / Getty Images WASHINGTON The Supreme Court could revisit the issue of same-sex couples rights as soon as this term if the justices take up the appeal of a woman whose Georgia adoption of her former partners children was ignored as void by the Alabama Supreme Court in September. The legal issue here, however, doesnt directly relate to marriage or even same-sex relationships centering instead on whether Alabama violated the Full Faith and Credit clause of the Constitution by not respecting the Georgia courts adoption ruling. Warning of the grave practical harm of the decision, the lawyers for the woman on Monday asked the Supreme Court to hear the case, in part, because it presents the ultimate conflict of authority dueling court orders in different states and threatens to shatter the legal ties that bind numerous Alabama adoptive parents to their children. The complex procedural case involves a now-ended relationship between two women whose names are presented only as initials V.L. and E.L. in the court filings. The women lived in Alabama, were in a long-term relationship, and had three children. E.L. gave birth to the children, and, eventually, the couple decided it would be smart to have V.L. adopt the children so both mothers would be their legal parents. Because Alabama would not allow such an adoption, the couple secured the adoption in Georgia. And while questions have now been raised about whether that adoption should have been allowed, both V.L. and E.L. supported it at the time it was sought and granted in 2007. The couple later ended their relationship, though, eventually leading to V.L. going to court in Alabama seeking to have the adoption decree enforced because she claimed that E.L. was denying her access to the children. While lower Alabama courts sided with V.L., the Alabama Supreme Court sided with E.L. in a ruling that rejected not only the validity of the Georgia adoption because, the opinion stated, Georgia law only would allow an adoption like the one entered into by V.L. if E.L. had given up all of her parental rights but the jurisdiction of the Georgia court even to have heard the adoption request. The Georgia judgment is accordingly void, and the full faith and credit clause does not require the courts of Alabama to recognize that judgment, the opinion stated. Indeed, it would be error for the courts of this State to do so . In contrast, the lower court held, as V.L. argues, that the court had jurisdiction to hear all adoption cases, so the question of whether the adoption should have been allowed is a question on the merits of the issue and, as such, an issue that only Georgia courts could upend. Under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution, V.L. argues, Alabama courts must respect that Georgia adoption. Because it found the Georgia adoption to have been a jurisdictional defect, however, the Alabama Supreme Court reasoned that the Alabama courts should give the Georgia adoption decree no effect. The lower court decisions were reversed, meaning V.L. would not be viewed as a parent in Alabama. In effect, eight years after the adoption decree was finalized by a Georgia court, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that the adoption never could have been approved under Georgia law, and so, now even though no Georgia court had ever ruled that way the Alabama Supreme Court could and did refuse to enforce the adoption decree. The facts of the dispute and ruling led Adam Unikowsky, a partner at Jenner & Block, to join the National Center for Lesbian Rights and the Alabama lawyers for V.L. in filing the petition for certiorari in the case at the Supreme Court on Monday. Unikowsky also enlisted the help of fellow Jenner & Block partner Paul Smith best known in gay legal circles for arguing successfully against sodomy laws at the Supreme Court in 2003. The thing about it is, its so glaringly, clearly wrong to have a judge in one state decide that the court in the other state got that states law wrong and make it jurisdictional on top of that, for no reason is just trampling on the basic principles of full faith and credit, Smith told BuzzFeed News on Monday afternoon. And, its doing it in the adoption context, which is the area where you want to have finality most of all. You cant tell someone theyre no longer a parent 8 years later based on what state youre in. Its a terrible decision. Unikowsky, a former clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia, is the counsel of record in the cert petition to the justices, as well as a request, also filed on Monday, asking for expedited consideration of a request to recall and stay the Alabama Supreme Courts judgement in the case. That request was submitted to Justice Clarence Thomas, who can decide the request on his own or refer the matter tot he full court. Notably, the cert petition presents the issue as a procedural case not a gay rights case declaring, This Court should grant certiorari. The decision of the Alabama Supreme Court conflicts with a century of this Courts Full Faith and Credit case law and deals a serious blow to the principles of comity and finality underlying the Clause. Smith echoed that in talking with BuzzFeed News about the filing, saying simply, This doesnt have to do with the identity of the parents; it has to do with finality of judgments. Of course, there is no guarantee the justices will take the case especially when, as here, the ruling is an outlier and not part of a series of conflicting rulings among appellate courts. Discussing the filing on Monday, though, NCLR Family Law Director Cathy Sakimura said that, despite the unprecedented nature of the ruling, she hoped the court would take up the case. As a result of that serious constitutional violation, the children in this case have been wrongly separated from one of their parents, and the stability of adoption judgments across the country has been called into question, Sakimura said in a statement. We are hopeful the Court will review this unprecedented decision and ensure that other states do not go down this dangerous and unlawful path. Even in the absence of disagreement among lower courts on the issue, Smith said, There are times when the court just decides something needs to be fixed even though its not a circuit split or something like that. Well see. At least we have to give them the opportunity to fix this because its such an egregious thing, to take away parenthood in this kind of situation . If the justices decide to take up the case and do so by mid-January, the case likely would be heard by the justices this term meaning a decision would be expected by the end of June. UPDATE The court-appointed representative of the children in V.L. and E.L.s litigation weighed in at the Supreme Court on Wednesday, seeking a stay of the Alabama Supreme Courts judgment in order to give the children access to both of their mothers.

aS"The painting is a protest against UK rules which ban men from donating blood within 12 months of having sex with another man. View this image  Conor Collins The painting was commissioned by campaign group Freedom to Donate, who unveiled it at an event at a reception at the Houses of Parliament on Monday. Artist Conor Collins told BuzzFeed News that almost all the blood is from medical professionals who are unable donate blood, because of their sexuality. With the exception of one person, all the blood in the painting is from GPs, surgeons, nurses. Theyre all medical professionals who, because of who they are, cant donate blood, he said. One of them was a heart surgeon and you literally trust him to open you up and hold your heart in his hands and yet we apparently, according to the law, dont trust him to donate blood. It was surprisingly easy to get the blood. Once I started telling people about the piece and the protest we were making, they were instantly eager to help. Men who have had sex with another man in the last 12 months cant give blood, according to NHS guidelines. View this image  Twitter: @AttitudeMag The first thing is that he anonymously through his actions saved the lives potentially of millions and millions of people, he said. And when you donate you anonymously save the life of someone youve never met and who youll maybe never meet. The second thing is that Alan Turing, despite all the actions and great things he did, if he was alive today he wouldnt be allowed to donate blood either. Conor Collins Conor Collins The blood makes up the majority of the image but theres a lot of varnish. Id use six or seven vials of blood then Id varnish it, leave it a few days then varnish, varnish, varnish. Then another layer of blood, then more varnish, said Collins. And this might be the last blood-based painting from Collins despite even using his own blood, hes scared by the sight of it. Im squeamish I feel so ill at the sight of blood, he said. It was obviously very important so I had to work through it. But blood knocks me sick, ironically. View this image  Conor Collins 8. WWII Codebreaker Alan Turing Granted Royal Pardon buzzfeed.com 9.

aS"Danial risked his life to get to Turkey, trusting that the refugee system would look after him when he got there. Instead, it was just the beginning of his problems. Lester Feder reports for BuzzFeed News. DENIZLI, Turkey There was only one way Danial could think of to get out of Iran: He would have to sell his kidney. He got the idea from fliers offering cash for organs, which he had seen pasted to walls in the northern Tehran neighborhood of Tajrish. Danial had vague memories of them tacked near the bus stop where hed get off to go to his painting classes. Those classes were how he kept his dream of becoming an artist alive, despite the fact that hed never been allowed to go to school. His situation felt hopeless. His mother had confronted him about being gay one December morning in 2013. By noon he had fled the family home, taking nothing but the clothes on his back and 50,000 rials about $2 in his pocket. His boyfriend lived in the city of Isfahan six hours to the south, but it wouldnt be safe for them to stay together even if he could afford a bus ticket. Danial had a job at a glass factory in southern Tehran he still has scars on his emaciated body from where the furnaces burned him but it didnt pay enough for him to rent an apartment on his own, let alone escape across the border into Turkey. I had no way forward, no way backwards I just wanted to escape from that place, Danial said. For most Iranians, getting to Turkey would be as simple as buying a plane ticket, which can cost less than $200; a few hundred LGBT Iranians make this trip every year because its an easy jumping-off point to a new life in the West. Iranian passport holders dont need a visa to enter Turkey, and the United Nations fast-tracks LGBT refugees for resettlement because it considers them especially vulnerable. But Danial couldnt get an Iranian passport. He was the son of an Afghan, one of the estimated 3 million who have come to Iran since the 1980s, fleeing decades of war and looking for work. The Iranian government wants them out; it generally doesnt grant their children citizenship and deliberately makes it hard for them to access basic services thats why Danial hadnt gone to school. Without documents, Danial could only get to Turkey by hiring smugglers to sneak him across the border, which would cost a seemingly impossible amount: around $1,000. Selling his kidney turned out to be harder than Danial had hoped. He initially marched into a government-run clinic on Valiasr Street in the heart of Tehran and announced he wanted to sell his kidney, but they wouldnt even let him past the front door because he had no ID to prove he was an adult. Then he got a break, of sorts. A man followed him out of the clinic and introduced himself as the uncle of an 8-year-old boy who needed a kidney transplant. They had a short conversation establishing that Danial had a compatible blood type, and the man offered him 50 million rials, about $1,700. I had no other options, so I accepted, Danial said. Like millions of other refugees from across the region, Danial saw going to Turkey and then on to the West as his only path to the future. But as their numbers have grown from around 25,000 to over 2 million in just four years the system for processing refugees in Turkey is being strained to breaking point. Danial sold his kidney to get to Turkey, trusting the system would take care of him once he got there. Instead he discovered that he had to fend for himself, navigating a system so complicated that the refugees with the fewest resources can easily fall through the cracks. View this image  Danial and Parsa. Bradley Secker for BuzzFeed News Danial had met his boyfriend, Parsa, at a birthday party for a mutual friend about two years before he fled his family. (Both men asked to be identified by their nicknames out of fear for their safety.) Parsa, a 21-year-old aspiring musician with an electric, angular smile, was DJing, and he chatted Danial up about a painting of a flower hed made as a birthday present for their friend. Parsa was about four years older than Danial and had also struggled to pursue a career in the arts after his family forced him to abandon his studies. They started dating soon after but could see each other only occasionally. When they couldnt be together, Danial and Parsa traded text messages every night before bed. I could not go to sleep without those messages, said Danial, whose high cheekbones make him look pixieish when he smiles. He suspects the messages were what tipped his family off to their relationship. I kept every single one. So Parsa was alarmed when he hadnt heard from Danial in the month after he left his mothers house. Danial finally broke the silence with a short message telling Parsa to meet him the next day at a hospital in Tehran. Parsa was frantic when he arrived, convinced Danial had been in an accident. But Danial looked perfectly healthy when he found him. Parsa was furious when he learned what he planned to do. For how much money did you put your life in danger? he recalled shouting at Danial. He started arguing with the doctors: With what authorization would you operate on someone who has no one with him and cut a part of his body how could you let him decide to do such thing? Danial had known Parsa would react this way, which is why he kept the plan a secret until all the arrangements were made; hed even rented a motel room for his recovery. Now it was too late to back out. The buyer had already invested around $350 for medical tests to confirm Danials kidney would match, and they had no way to repay it. The couple also felt for the child who was due to receive his kidney, whom they saw being wheeled into surgery. He was a very small boy who had so many scars all over his body his kidneys were failing since he was born, Parsa remembered. Danial realized what a terrible mistake hed made immediately after his surgery. His stitches became infected, and he burned through some of his profits to have them treated. Months flew by and he was still not well enough to travel; the bill for his room was beginning to add up even though he was paying just $14 per night. After six months, he had just about $1,060 left, and he was still very weak. I had no way back to undo what I had done, Danial said. I realized I had even more problems. View this image  Danial shows the scars on his body left by the operation to remove one of his kidneys. Bradley Secker for BuzzFeed News Many LGBT Iranians who seek asylum in Turkey simply fly to Ankara and go straight to the office that registers new refugees. Iranians make up the majority of the 700 LGBT people currently in the pipeline for resettlement who have identified themselves to the local office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). One NGO that supports queer Iranian refugees reports getting an average of 30 new requests for help every month. Hundreds of LGBT Iranians have been resettled in the West especially in Canada over the past several years, and many arrive in Turkey with a good deal of information about how to navigate the process. It now generally takes about two years for them to get a ticket out of Turkey even though UNHCR considers LGBT people especially vulnerable and fast-tracks them for resettlement. Many LGBT Iranians have had friends whove already been resettled or at least know the general outline of the process; some save up for the wait before they come or even have support from their families, making the wait easier to bear. But Danial had to travel before he was really ready. If he waited any longer to recover his strength, he wouldnt be able to afford the smugglers fee. Parsa would have to meet him in Turkey. He was an Iranian citizen and so would be able to fly to Turkey legally, but it would take a little time for him to get his passport issued. In early August 2014, two smugglers guided Danial and a few others on a four-day trek through mountains and forests from the Iranian town of Maku to Van in southeastern Turkey. At night they would sleep in clearings in the brush. Despite Danials fragile condition, he had to run in places where they might encounter border patrols. In Van, the smugglers put him on a bus to Ankara. As the bus left the station, he realized that he was now totally on his own and had very little idea about what would happen next. He could speak no Turkish. He didnt even know that Turkey used a different currency than Iran and got cheated out of half his remaining cash when a money changer took advantage of his ignorance. He had a sheaf of papers documenting his kidney surgery, but nothing to prove his identity. He couldnt even definitively tell refugee officials how old he was his best guess was around 21 or 22 by that point because his family never told him his birthdate. The only thing I knew was there is something called the United Nations, he said. I thought because we are gay and we are different, there is nothing to be scared of. View this image  The center of the Turkish city of Denizli, home to many LGBT Iranian asylum seekers. The rooster is Denizlis official symbol. Bradley Secker for BuzzFeed News Danial followed a group of other refugees from the bus station in Ankara to the office of the Association for Solidarity with Asylum Seekers and Migrants (ASAM), an NGO that registers refugees on behalf of UNHCR. Others who passed through that ASAM office around the same time described it as an off-white building in a well-off residential neighborhood that appeared to have been built for the time before Turkey became one of the worlds top destinations for refugees. Iranians and Afghans waited alongside Syrians and people from a number of other Arab countries in chaotic lines that streamed out the front door. Refugees choked the narrow hallways inside, waiting to be summoned for processing. The walls echoed with the cries of screaming children and exuded the smell of the thousands who had passed through the building in a desperate search for shelter. Danial wound up in line with a bunch of Afghans, who advised him to say he was Afghan when his turn came to explain his case. They told me Afghans are being accepted easily [as refugees], compared to Iranians, he said. So I just said I was Afghan and gay I had nothing else to say and I had no documents. This proved to be a serious mistake, according to Saghi Ghahraman, director of the Toronto-based Iranian Queer Organization (IRQO), which assists Iranians with the refugee process and ultimately took up Danials and Parsas cases. Most of her Iranian clients leave the ASAM office with a date for their first face-to-face meeting with a UNHCR official called a pre-interview but Danial left without any appointment at all. Its impossible to know for sure if Danials case would have progressed differently if hed said he was Iranian. But a number of refugee advocates told BuzzFeed News that UNHCR appears to have generally put all Afghan cases on hold, largely because the countries that take refugees from Turkey allocate very few slots to people of Afghan origin. Danial didnt get a pre-interview date at that time because he said he was Afghan, Ghahraman said. Selin Unal, spokesperson for UNHCR-Turkey, did not comment directly on this case, but she denied that the agency is treating Afghan refugees differently than any others in an email to BuzzFeed News. UNHCR continues to process vulnerable Afghan asylum seekers and refugees, and provides protection assistance to those in need in collaboration with the Turkish government and NGOs, she said. But, she said, Resettlement opportunities depend on quotas [set] by resettlement countries. Parsa, who showed up at ASAM on Dec. 18 with an Iranian passport, sailed through the system compared to Danial. He had his first interview with UNHCR on Jan. 27, was granted refugee status by the agency in April, and his paperwork was with the Canadian government by the end of June to be considered for resettlement. His case may have been accelerated because they enlisted the help of IRQOs Ghahraman shortly before he registered. Danial said they learned about IRQO by chance when they struck up a conversation with some trans refugees they overheard speaking Farsi in a public park, and it took a couple of tries before they convinced Ghahraman about the urgency of their case. Her intervention also nudged Danials case forward UNHCR brought him in for his pre-interview in January, after she described his case to an agency contact. But in the months after Parsa learned he might go to Canada, no call came telling Danial he was going too. They had spent much of their year in Turkey on the edge of homelessness. Danial had followed other refugees he met at the ASAM office in Ankara to the city of Denizli, a fast-growing city of about 600,000 people nestled at the feet of dramatic mountains in southeastern Turkey. Turkey bars refugees from most countries from living in major cities like Istanbul, and Denizli had become a major hub for Iranians especially LGBT Iranians awaiting resettlement. Denizlis downtown is clean and new, but its economy is built on textile manufacturing allowing refugees who are prohibited from working legally to eke out a living under the table in sweatshops. The work was hard on Danial, whose urine sometimes turned red from internal bleeding at the end of 12-hour days hauling bolts of fabric that could weigh more than he did. Sometimes the bosses wouldnt pay the wages they owed, and Danial and Parsa were thrown out of one apartment after another. Danial became convinced he would never be freed from this purgatory and worried Parsa would give up his chance to go to Canada in order to stay with him. He grew so weak that his dark black hair began falling out in patches, making his scalp look almost leopard-spotted. UNHCR referred him to a psychiatrist, who said he couldnt do anything to advance his case and instead offered him a prescription for anti-anxiety pills. My case will not end up anywhere and [Parsa] is stuck because of me, Danial remembered thinking to himself one night when Parsa went out to buy bread. I knew that if I have to stay here, he will stay with me and not leave. I wanted him to go and live free, Danial said, so I took all of those pills. Danial was unconscious when Parsa found him. Parsa frantically searched for a neighbor who knew the number to call for an ambulance and spoke enough Turkish to give them the address. The paramedics would not let him ride with Danial in the ambulance, and he had to be careful about how he showed his feelings because they lived in a building filled with other Iranian refugees who they were terrified would figure out they were a couple. It was like a nightmare, Parsa said. The doctor said that Danial could die anytime within the next three days but if he survived that period he would live. Danial survived, but when the couple spoke to BuzzFeed News two weeks after his suicide attempt, he was feeling more alone than ever. No one can ever help us, Danial said. What does U.N. believe in? Why does U.N. exist? When they dont help me, who are they helping? On Oct. 12, Danial finally got a piece of good news: He would also be considered by Canada for resettlement. Their problems arent over yet; it often takes about another year from this step in the process before a refugee actually boards a plane. But at least the end is in sight. But their story shows just how easily the most vulnerable refugees can fall through the cracks in the system that should be trying to help them most, said Ghahraman. If they hadnt found an advocate with contacts inside UNHCR, Danial might never have even learned that it was a mistake to say he was Afghan, let alone had a chance to correct it. Many of the people who work in UNHCR are doing it for all the right reasons, Ghahraman said, and she has seen individuals leap into action when they learn of a refugee who needs extra help. But the system as a whole is set up to comply with the policy and the rules and laws nobody helps somebody out just based on humanity, she said. Danial is still painting while he waits mostly pictures of flowers though he was using up the last of canvases and had no money for more. Other than his medical records, just about the only other things he brought with him from Iran were 12 small tubes of oil paint. Its more than a year that I am waiting in Turkey; for someone who is in good situation, this might not feel like [even] a month, but for me it feels like years I cannot take it anymore, Danial said. My art is painting and I really cant do anything else. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

View this image  Bishakh Som The project hopes to expand the scope of Transgender Day of Remembrance to encompass the uplifting of trans people, especially trans women and femmes of color. What the poster is talking about is specific to indigenous culture from that part of Colorado, Som told BuzzFeed News, asserting the importance of cultural specificity in looking at gender-nonconforming identities. For me that was a great experience, learning about two-spirit culture, and how it weaves together with current trans activism. View this image  Bishakh Som Kluding-Rodriguez is thrilled with how the poster turned out. Im nearly speechless. Its absolutely beautiful. Literally in awe, she said. Kluding-Rodriguez added that Soms inspired interpretation of indigenous imagery and their tribute to victims of violence in the local community were the most deeply moving elements of the poster. We were all really inspired by being able to be connected to ancestors who at one time or another werent persecuted or shamed or subjected to violence because of their gender, Kluding-Rodriguez said.

I scrambled, while having a massive coronary, to exit the message before the photo loaded. Thankfully, it wasnt a dick pic. I lived to see another day, but I did send Matt a screenshot and whined like a small child.

Its a really strange place that takes some getting used to. Much of Grindr is just about the transaction and you have to be really active about it.

Sarah Karlan / BuzzFeed Sarah Karlan / BuzzFeed Sarah: I did respond to a few messages I had received overnight in my best Matt Ortile style. At one point I thought I had a pretty solid conversation going. My confidence at an all-time high, I sent a screenshot to Matt. He quickly informed me I was chatting away with a bot. Looking back, that makes sense, since whoever I was chatting with really wouldnt quit talking about his gym shorts. I realized maybe I needed to have more of a tutorial. I had Matt sit down and explain a few things, like, Why are people saying Im a field researcher?* I needed guidance and wasnt afraid to admit it. Matt: *My bio on Grindr says, oh, you know, doing field research. Its actually led to some cute convos. The way people open a chat is very telling, so if they riff on that bit of my bio, I can tell they might actually be down to talk or have a drink. Sarah Karlan / BuzzFeed Sarah Karlan / BuzzFeed Sarah: Now that I know how to tell a real person from a bot and no longer feel weird about having a swath of naked man chest on my phone screen, I struggle to get an actual conversation going. Even if dudes are way more forward on Grindr, its clearly a universal struggle to get past the hey stage of things. I find myself getting sort of insulted if conversations dont go anywhere, even though it isnt anything against me. I try different tactics and see what works. Funny and coy? Aggressive and forward? Reminding myself that Im THE Matt Ortile, not myself, boosts my confidence. Who cares what I say? There is no wrong answer just get the people talking. I changed Matts profile picture to a classy B&W number hoping to get some more serious takers. Matt Ortile / BuzzFeed Sarah Karlan / BuzzFeed Matt: People often write losing messages on their profiles on Grindr, claiming that the app is dropping conversations which is why they may not reply to you. Its a fair disclaimer, but also a convenient one. Sorry! Not gonna reply because youre not my type! is a rough thing to say on any sex/dating app. And so we end up with radio silence: a universally acknowledged and polite-ish no thank you. View this image  Sarah Karlan / BuzzFeed Sarah: I can remember it like it was yesterday, because it was today: sitting on the train and trying not to let the person next to me see my screen as I opened up a new message. PRAISE, the dick pics finally happened. I was dreading the moment so much it was actually sort of a relief when they popped up. Is there a golden rule of threes when it comes to dick pics? I didnt respond to his offerings, but silently considered the confidence it must take to send a stranger a nude of yourself. Like I could never? Good for you, sir. But also, no thanks. Matt: The one thing I have to say about dick pics is that sometimes its not even theirs. I was with a friend who once sent a dick pic to a guy over Grindr, but the dick in question wasnt his! He sent it just to appease the thirsty, he said. He thought it was harmless, but Id feel pretty awful if I wound up getting a dick pic that was actually my own. If you learn one thing from this post, gang, let it be this: Trust no dick pic. View this image  Sarah Karlan / BuzzFeed Sarah: I finally was able to hold a conversation that lasted throughout an entire day. We chatted about work, weekend plans, and outside hobbies. He was the total package. I felt a pang of guilt about not ~ really ~ being Matt, but I was also excited that I had actually gotten though to someone. View this image  Jon Premosch / Sarah Karlan / BuzzFeed Matt: Im glad Sarah got to play around as a decent-looking Filipino boy on Grindr for a bit, although it turns out we didnt see eye-to-eye with her pick and I never met up with the chosen one \\_()_/. Sorry, no wedding bells this time. Once, a guy on the app asked whats your background? When Sarah asked me if I was fully Pinoy, then told the guy, the guy replied, Thats hot. -1 for a possible fetish, +1 for being well-intentioned? Its just a weird world out there thats still worth exploring if youve got a 30 minutes to kill. But otherwise, I dont terribly miss Grindr. Ill stick to Twitter for now. Sarah: Grindr is a lot about dicks, but if you dig past them theres real heart there. I feel like if I was a gay dude I would absolutely use it, if not for date-hunting then for at least for entertainment? It also made me feel silly for stressing out so much back when I was single and using dating apps. Why wait for the other person to message you? Who cares what you say? The One might be passing you by if you dont reach out. I would say to any queer women out there hustling that dating app life: Take a page out of Grindrs book and be a little more aggressive and dont be afraid to go big! LIFE IS FRAGILE AND FLEETING, SEND NUDES. No, maybe dont do that. But you should put yourself out there, because you just never know. And Grindr Guys? Maybe at least strike up a conversation before you send the dick pic its just good manners. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .

aS"April Hoagland and Beckie Peirce, who were licensed as foster parents this year, have been taking care of the girl and planned to legally adopt her. View this image  kutv.com  A Utah judge reversed an order that would require a married couple to give up the 1-year-old girl theyve been fostering for the past three months because they are gay, according to the Associated Press. April Hoagland and Beckie Peirce, who were licensed as foster parents this year, have been taking care of the girl while the state moves to end the biological mothers parental rights, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. The girls biological mother has asked Peirce and Hoagland to adopt her daughter, the couple told the paper. The couple is also raising Peirces 12-year-old and 14-year-old biological children. We are shattered, April Hoagland told KUTV. It hurts me really badly because I havent done anything wrong. Earlier this week, 7th District Court Juvenile Judge Scott Johansen ordered the girl removed from the home within seven days, citing research that children do better in heterosexual homes. Removing a child from a loving home simply because the parents are LGBT is outrageous, shocking, and unjust, Human Rights Commission President Chad Griffin said in a statement. It also flies in the face of overwhelming evidence that children being raised by same-sex parents are just as healthy and well-adjusted as those with different-sex parents. At a time when so many children in foster care need loving homes, it is sickening to think that a child would be taken away from caring parents who planned to adopt. facebook.com The Division of Child and Family Services wis looking for a new placement for the child, as to not violate the judges order, director Brent Platt told BuzzFeed News. Ultimately, I need to do whats best for this kid, Platt said, adding that he will be looking in to ways of keeping the girl legally with Hoagland and Peirce. The division on Thursday afternoon announced it had filed a motion with the judge to keep his order from going into effect. If the judge does not take back his order, a spokesperson for the division said they would take the case to the court of appeals since they do not believe removal is in the best interest of the child. We had no reason to want to move the child, Platt said. Were going to look at options to keep the child there theres no reason not to. Platt said DCFS does not keep track of how many children are currently placed in same-sex homes. If youre licensed and youre qualified, and youre a good fit, were going to place a kid with you, he said. Johansen has made headlines for his courtroom behavior in the past, reports the Salt Lake Tribune. He was reprimanded in 1997 by the Utah Judicial Conduct Commission for slapping a 16-year-old boy in the courthouse. He also drew criticism in 2014 for ordering a mother to cut off her 13-year-old daughters ponytail in court as punishment. In his monthly news conference on KUED, Utah Governor Gary Herbert said he believes judge Johansen should follow the law. I expect the court and the judge to follow the law. He may not like the law, but he should follow the law, Herbert said. We dont want to have activism on the bench in any way, shape or form. Laws, sometimes people dont like, but the judge should not interject his own personal beliefs and feelings and supersede the law. Calls to Hoagland and Peirce were not immediately returned.

aS"But Greens MP Adam Bandt says its the ACL that should apologise. View this image  Earlier this week, a report from the parliamentary joint committee on human rights found Warren Entschs cross-party bill for marriage equality would help end discrimination. However, government MPs Michael Sukkar, David Gillespie and Matthew Canavan penned a dissenting report, arguing the reform would infringe the human rights of marriage celebrants, service providers, and children. Greens MP Adam Bandt described the three politicians as bigots scraping the bottom of the barrel on Wednesday. View this image  Its time for the Greens to start engaging the arguments instead of name-calling said managing director Lyle Shelton. Adam Bandts labelling of three parliamentarians bigots simply because they are standing up for marriage between one man and one woman is a new low in Australian politics. Shelton argued changing marriage to include same-sex couples would strip freedom of conscience, thought and religion from millions of Australians and deny children their parents. All Australians must be free to discuss these consequences without fear of being labelled a bigot, he said. I was making the point that the bigots are those grasping at straws by saying marriage equality is a breach of human rights, he told BuzzFeed News. When 59% of Australian Christians support marriage equality, its the ACL that should apologise for pushing prejudice and misrepresenting Christian values. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Its better to have a gay parade than Russian tanks in the center of the Ukrainian capital, said a lawmaker urging his colleagues to vote for the bill. View this image  A woman holds a placard reading The rights of gays, lesbians and bisexuals are human rights during a demonstration outside the Ukrainian parliament Sergei Supinsky / AFP / Getty Images The Ukrainian parliament passed a law on Thursday barring employment discrimination that includes protections for LGBT people, a step the European Union had made a condition of closer ties with the former Soviet country. Lawmakers had twice rejected the nondiscrimination bill earlier this month over opposition to the LGBT protections. This was the last of a suite of legislation required by the EU which also included controversial laws against corruption for Ukraine to qualify for a program allowing its citizens to travel to the EU without needing visas. The bill only passed after six rounds of voting on Thursday. After the bill narrowly failed on the the fifth attempt, Speaker Volodymyr Groysman called a recess to lobby for the vote, the Kyiv Post reported, telling lawmakers, Seven votes stand between us and a visa-free regime. Ukraine has been in the process of forging a closer relationship with the EU for years, but the link has grown increasingly important since the Ukrainian territory of Crimea was annexed by Russia last year and Russian-backed rebels seized control in eastern parts of the country. Generally the EU requires nondiscrimination protections be adopted at an earlier stage of the process of association with the EU, but Ukraine was given more time after former President Viktor Yanukovych walked away from signing a long-negotiated agreement with the bloc, leading to an uprising against his government. Yuri Lutsenko, leader of a junior party in the governing coalition, had urged lawmakers to vote for the bill, saying, its better to have a gay parade on Khreschatyk Kievs central thoroughfare than Russian tanks in the center of the Ukrainian capital. I believe that if were going to Europe, we should recognize the accepted rules in the European community, reported Korrespondent. Russian allies have used hostility towards LGBT rights to try to build opposition to the EU for several years. Association with the EU means same-sex marriage, said billboards that went up around the Ukrainian capital shortly before Yanukovych announced he would abandon European ties and instead join a customs union created by Russia. Evelyne Paradis, executive director of the European LGBT rights group ILGA-Europe, praised Ukraine for adopting the bill in a statement following the vote, but called on lawmakers to truly embrace the spirit of the legislation they have passed. The vote was not just about visa liberalisation, it could be the start of a new chapter of engagement on the rights of LGBTI people in Ukraine, Paradis said. Now, the work of the Ukrainian government enters a critical phase; they have an obligation to ensure that the Code is implemented in its entirety.    Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The head of Costa Ricas Civil Registry has already annulled the marriage and is calling for charges to be brought against the couple and their lawyer. View this image  A man waving a gay pride flag is reflected in the pavement as he protests outside the Supreme Court in San Jose, Costa Rica AP Photo/Monica Quesada A lesbian couple whose marriage was registered in Costa Rica last month are waiting to learn if they will face jail time for formalizing their union. Same-sex marriages are not recognized in Costa Rica and the law provides for a jail sentence of up to six years for those who knowingly violate the law. But its not clear whether the case of 28-year-old Laura Florez-Estrada and 24-year-old Jazmin Elizondo will meet the requirements for criminal charges to be brought. Due to a clerical error, Elizondos birth certificate actually lists her sex as male. The lawyer who notarized their marriage contract on Oct. 27, a leader of the LGBT rights group Movimiento Diversidad named Marco Castillo, also could be charged. But he argues there was nothing illegal about their union. I legally married a man and a woman, Costa Ricas La Nacin quoted Castillo as saying. But after news of the marriage broke, the director of Costa Ricas Civil Registry, Luis Bolanos, issued a new birth certificate for Elizondo listing her as female, nullified the union, and referred the case to prosecutors, Castillo told BuzzFeed News. We believe that these people were aware that a marriage between people of the same sex warrants a complaint, that parts of the Criminal Code might have been broken, Bolanos said in calling for criminal charges, according to AFP. Castillo said he could not comment much about the case in an interview with BuzzFeed News because charges were pending, though he said they had various ways to defend ourselves if a prosecutor choses to bring charges. He said he and the women went ahead with the marriage knowing that there was a risk that charges could be filed against them. This is fundamentally about civil disobedience he said. The public discussion favors a climate in favor of same-sex marriage. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The power of the woman has just not even been unleashed around the world. View this image  View this image  Over the last six months its really been a progression. I have found that women have so much unleashed power that they dont really utilize because they dont have confidence in themselves about who they are, and what they can do. I have always actually been with and attracted to very strong women, and I think Ive learned a lot from them. The power of the woman has just not even been unleashed around the world.

Im kind of at this point in my life where Im trying to figure this womanhood thing out. It is more than hair, makeup, clothes, all that kind of stuff. Theres an element here, that Im still kind of searching for. And I think thatll take a while. Because I think as far as gender, were all on a journey. Were all learning and growing about ourselves.

aS"Shane Jenek, better known as Australian drag queen Courtney Act, spoke to BuzzFeed about his friendship with Chaz Bono, dealing with anxiety over his gender identity, and how RuPauls Drag Race changed his life. View this image  Courtney Act (far right) with (L-R) Andrew G, Jamie Durie, Warren Sonin, Gavin Atkins, Mark Holden, and Marcia Hines at the 2004 TV Week Logie Awards nominations in Sydney. The next day, a determined Jenek returned but this time as his drag persona, Courtney Act. Courtney sufficiently wowed the judges to not only make it on to the show, but also end up a semifinalist. Her appearance on the show led to a record deal, a host of live performances, and the introduction of drag to many households across Australia. In the ensuing decade, Courtney cemented herself as a stalwart of the Australian LGBTI community. Both a vibrant performer and an actual singer as opposed to many other drag queens who are talented mimes Courtney performed regularly, participated in the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, and released singles as a recording artist. View this image  Her drag name a play on the words caught in the act didnt translate well to the American accent, she jokingly tells BuzzFeed News. But everything else was perfect, and Courtney was one of two runners up in Season 6 of the widely watched show. Since then, the charismatic drag queen, now 33, has toured the globe, dealt with a flurry of increased media interest, and has experienced what she terms an epiphany about gender itself. View this image  Jenek is perched on a chair in the BuzzFeed kitchen, dressed as Courtney. His makeup is flawless. It went from zero to a hundred in a week, he says. After Drag Race you do club shows, your social media figures balloon, youre doing five cities a week performing around the world, literally, all through Europe and the UK, all through America, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Asia, its just insane. Even in countries where its not on television, Ive done shows. I was worried nobody would turn up but then they were packed. View this image  The gay community has got these sorts of unspoken guidelines about masculinity, like muscles, tans, and all of these sorts of things, he says. And because I perform as Courtney, I always had this struggle between wanting to fit in with the boys and wanting to pursue this thing that I loved so much. With one foot in the drag world and one foot out, Jenek felt torn between two opposite ends of masculinity and femininity. There were two ideals in my head, the male underwear model or the Victorias Secret model and I remember not knowing which one I wanted to be. View this image  The pair met through Drag Race, on which Bono was a judge who quickly became smitten with Courtney. He said something about my femininity, and even that, it got my back up again, Jenek says. I said, What do you mean, femininity? Im a man whos dressing up in drag. There were other occurrences throughout my twenties where people who in no way were trying to attack or insult me asked me questions about my gender, and I just got really aggressive about it. With Bono, Jenek would talk at length about gender, sexuality, masculinity, and femininity, detailing his own conceptions of gender and his struggle with his own identity. It was in one of these conversations that Bono suggested to Jenek the word he might be looking for was genderqueer. I had just explained to him my concept of my gender, Jenek says. And he said, I hear what youre saying, but what about this idea? And I just heard the word genderqueer. I had this aha! moment when I realised that I didnt have to be a man and I didnt have to be a woman, I didnt have to be either of these things, and that I could just be me. View this image  I like the terms genderfluid and genderqueer, but ultimately those terms helped me get to a place where I didnt need labels any more, I was like, Oh, Im just me, he explains. If there was a scale I would say Im on the male side, but close to the middle. The fame Jenek found through Drag Race has led to young people seeking out Jenek to send him messages of support and thanks. A day doesnt go by when somebody doesnt send me a message, he says, adding that he mostly gets messages from kids who identify as queer, or are figuring out their gender. A lot of young queer kids reach out to me and say thank you for saying that thats who you were and giving me the vocabulary and those ideas, he says. While Jenek is appreciative of an increasingly diverse representation of genders on TV, he would like to see more people who identify as genderqueer or genderfluid in the public eye. Obviously theres Caitlyn Jenner and Laverne Cox and all these trans people who are so inspiring and so brilliant, he says. But people who might feel gender diverse may feel transitioning is the only option. I like to represent that theres some grey area as well.

aS"The Bring Your Own Body exhibit, on view now at The Cooper Union in New York, showcases trans art inspired by history. Walking into the gallery at The Cooper Union in New York for the Bring Your Own Body exhibit, Im greeted by the faces of Transparent producer and visual artist Zackary Drucker and her mom Penny Sori, who play the fictional mother and daughter Moxi and Patti in an odd and hilarious video called Southern for Pussy. As Moxi and Patti engage in an X-rated crafting session, scrapbooking what look like body parts and illustrations from transgender porn magazines, Patti opines: View this image  Then the two of them discuss better substitutes. Eventually, the conversation gets even deeper as Moxi asks Patti an intimate question: View this image  This all leads to Moxi cruising for dates on her phone as Patti does her hair: View this image  Druckers video is the perfect introduction to an exhibition that plays with transgender identity and history in unusual ways. In Southern for Pussy, theres no clear indication whether Moxi is meant to be cisgender or transgender, which opens up many fascinating ambiguities, especially as Moxi eventually meets her date. Below are some other highlights from Bring Your Own Body, which features contemporary artists engaging with historical sexology archives, such as those of The Kinsey Institute, to create dialogues between gender ideas of the past and the present moment of transgender visibility. View this image  One of the most inviting and enigmatic pieces in the show is an installation by genderfluid stalwart Justin Vivian Bond, whose My Model / MySelf evokes both the hominess of a favorite relaxation spot, along with the fabulousness of a low-hanging chandelier at the center. View this image  Bond also combined their image along with 70s artist and model Karen Graham to create gorgeous wallpaper, further heightening the fab-domestic effect. View this image  An Asian-American transgender femme artist with a large online following who committed suicide in 2012, Mark Aguhars varied work occupies a whole wall of the exhibit as a set of works called Moving Looks, but her most viscerally affecting works are simple text drawings that challenge perceived stereotypes and expectations of trans women. View this image  Aguhars wall also features loose-fitting red and white clothing pieces that function somewhere between costume and identity expression; Polaroid images of bondage acts; and text and image watercolors that play on gender and race, making the show function almost like a mini-retrospective for an artist who died just as the public was becoming more aware of her art. View this image  View this image  The piece in the show that most deeply engages with historical archives is Chris Vargass Transvestites in the News. The piece is named after the scrapbooks of Louise Lawrence, a trans correspondent of Alfred Kinseys who clipped transgender-related articles in the 1950s and sent them to him. Vargas, who also founded the Museum of Transgender Hirstory and Art (MOTHA), has copied headlines from these clippings and turned them into a collage that has been reprinted as a broadsheet and is available for free as part of the exhibition. Headlines like I Just Love Being a Female Impersonator and Swish Set Demands Equal Rights give us a tantalizing glimpse into the gender politics of that era. View this image  Another artist recently lost to suicide, Effy Beth from Argentina contributed this still timely piece from 2011 called Una nueva artista necesita usar el bao (A new artist needs to use the bathroom). It shows the artist going through a door with a womens bathroom sign, the names of iconic women artists written on her back. Its as though Beth is both taking on the burdens of being a woman artist but also asking to be able to be accepted as one of their ranks, at a time when transgender women are routinely rejected from womens spaces and labeled as men.

aS"Weve seen narratives of later-in-life transitioning parents like Caitlyn Jenner and Maura on Transparent but what about trans women like me planning for future parenthood? Im forging my own way. View this image  Raphalle Martin for BuzzFeed News On a Sunday last spring, after locking up the office at my old job, I turned into the hall and saw a little girl. She was eight or nine, and wore a hair band that glistened with purple sequins. The girl was alone I could make out some adults through the frosted office windows behind her, but nobody was there with us in the hallway and she was dancing. Wild, flail around, Twist and Shout dancing. It was incredible. That looks fun! I said, smiling at her. Immediately she stopped dancing and looked over at me. It occurred to me that this was the first time Id really interacted with a child since I began my transition six months earlier. I felt an anxiety leap up in me is she looking at me like that because I dont make sense to her, because Im weird, or but then, somehow, she smiled. Do you have a little girl, too? she asked. I shook my head. When I got onto the elevator, I added, But I want to be a mom someday. Good! she said, then started to dance again as the elevator doors closed. A few months later, in the heart of summer, my coworker L sat with me at work updating me about a family picnic the weekend before. She told me about her niece, who ran around the whole time in her dress, playing jokes and being sweet and ridiculous while her mother chased her. Dont you miss being a girl and feeling free like that? L said, sighing. I felt a familiar pang of loss for the girlhood with the dresses and the giggling and the running. This feeling is old. Its particularly strong in summer, when I walk past kids on school breaks, traveling with their families. It makes me want to find a dark place and yell. Im ascribed an alternative personal history when I pass as cisgender: people who dont know any better assume that I had a girl-presenting childhood during which I ran around feeling femme and free. Maybe I had a girlhood and a boyhood all rolled into one, or something altogether different. What do you call missing something that never really happened? At some point, I realized that while I would always need to manage the loss of girlhood, that loss doesnt need to control the way I live my life. As I thought about Ls picnic, my feelings of loss faded, and in their place was curiosity. What did her nieces childhood look like? Was it marked by adventures and friendships, the endlessness of internal worlds? Was it sorrowful? Was it liberating? My dysphoria felt small next to the possibility of nurturing a childhood where, as a parent, I could step back and make room for gender where I could affirm self-expression without limits or expectations. I am a trans woman, and I plan to adopt and raise kids. I want to be the kind of person who helps a little human navigate the terrors and wonders of childhood, to tell them they are complete in whatever way they unfold to assure them that love is their birthright. Yet Im still learning what my kind of motherhood would look like, since I live among institutions and ideologies that continue to question my existence. In the recent blitz of media narratives of transgender women, the role of the later-in-life transitioning parents (from Maura in Transparent to Caitlyn Jenner) have received the most attention, in stories often told from the perspectives of adult children a spectacle of identity to be processed by family members. It is only in small glimpses, such as the prison visitations between Sophia Burset (played by Laverne Cox) and her son in in Orange is the New Black, that we see trans women striving to provide a foundation for their children. These stories reflect the preoccupation with transitioning individuals engaged in an epic struggle with identity, rather than the everyday lives that trans folks actually build, fight for, and share with others. That morning at the library with L, I tried to imagine myself raising a daughter. Do you have to pretend to be frustrated at your child when she plays pranks on your extended family, even when those pranks are really funny? At what age will she want to play card games on the lawn with me? If shes into fixing up cars, or figure skating, or something else I know nothing about, will she be okay with me cheerleading and supporting her even if I occasionally make a fool of myself? And when the parents of her classmates learn about my identity, how will they react? Im okay with making a fool of myself, and Im okay with managing the pain, but how can I protect her from the meanness of others? Generations of women women who could not conceive; women who were queer or part of nontraditional partnerships; women who adopted alone late in life; women who were marginalized by poverty and white supremacy and then judged by society as incapable of showing children stability; women who were for a million reasons considered the wrong kind of woman have been spectacular mothers. I know that countless trans women must number their ranks. But I still struggle to find stories that shed light on the kind of mother I hope to one day be. Im still learning what to expect in negotiating the adoption agency, the benefits coordinator in HR, and even the judgmental parents of my future kids classmates. Im looking for possibility models of trans women who take on motherhood and bring something beautiful, and stable, to a childs life. Of course, not every trans person wants to be a parent. But from my conversations with other trans women, I know Im not alone. Many of my friends want to raise a child, to give them safety and freedom and to serve as a mother in their life. The role of mother, for these women, means something real and urgent and true. And at the same time, so many in our community are mired deeply in difficulties that are immediate and all-consuming: battles to secure employment, shelter, access to health care and safety. Ironically, the very things that make establishing ourselves difficult are also things we can share with children: our tenacity; our willingness to affirm people exactly as they are, and not as society says they should be; patience and humor and compassion in the face of all obstacles. My friend Athena Brewer, who is a psychotherapist and a former director of the Trevor Project, recently told me how trans teenagers in crisis often talk about parenthood how it serves as a beacon for them, even as they struggle to make it out of an abusive household or escape the precariousness of homelessness. They already want to give more than they have been given. We have more stories than ever about the drama of transition, and the struggles for survival that trans women face but what about the other meaningful choices we make in our lives? When I first started searching for transgender mother resources online, I found pages upon pages of information about mothers raising children who are transgender which is wonderful! but almost nothing about trans mothers themselves. Then I discovered a remarkable woman: Meghan Stabler. In 2014, Stabler, a transgender woman, was named Working Mother of the Year by Working Mother magazine. Stabler described in a 2014 op-ed how as a mother, the most profound barrier she faces is the economic reality of being both a working mother and a transgender woman in the workplace: Its a widely discussed fact that, on average, women in America are still being paid less than men for the same work yet transgender employees have a much higher chance of being unemployed or underemployed, leading to further complications in the workplace. And later: Im just like any other mom, be she single, partnered or married: Im planning meals, balancing budgets, figuring out how to encourage my child to enjoy reading, and juggling my schedule to accommodate taking my daughter to the doctor when shes sick. While most of the U.S. puts a label on who I am, both at home and in the workplace, to myself Im just a working mother. What is remarkable is the staggering inequality we working mothers face. Stabler is clearly a woman doing whatever it takes to make ends meet for her child. Her attempt to provide a stable livelihood sits at the intersection of so many pressures: LGBT protections from workplace discrimination, pay inequality for women, and inadequate supports for working mothers, to name three. Were she a woman of color, or if she did not have access to the same types of professional jobs, I imagine the list would be even longer. While Stabler fully acknowledges the precariousness we live in as transgender women 52% of Americans still live in states that do not prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity her writing makes me feel hopeful. I know shes out there, kicking butt in her profession, using her voice for activism, and then coming home and reading with her kid. Shes making it work, while also demanding more for everyone. I can tell that she has so much to give as a mother. Last month, I visited my little nephew. Im watching him grow up. He ran up when I visited to hug me, his auntie. In the car, I asked him what sound does a cat make, and we meowed at each other for the rest of the ride. My mom took me aside during the visit back home and told me how much she enjoys watching me in auntie mode. I cant wait to see you as a mother, she told me, and beamed. Though my head was awash with anxiety that day about the insurance coverage that fell through, and the savings account that may or may not dwindle away, I smiled back. I cant wait, either. I grew up in a household where my father worked and traveled full-time, and my mother raised me and my siblings full-time. My mom never seemed like the stereotype of the discontented stay-at-home mother; I knew that raising children was something joyful for her. I want to share that loving relationship with a child, and also give them the peace and stability that Ive sought out for myself over the years. Being included in this continuity of motherhood in my family is enormously meaningful to me and something from which many trans folks are forcibly excluded. I dont take it for granted. I am hopeful that trans women can be that for each other, too that we can support each other specifically as trans mothers, and extend a sense of continuity and belonging in motherhood to those most systematically discouraged from taking part. Every so often, a glimmer of trans motherhood appears in a story or movie or song, and shows me something beautiful. Ive begun to collect these moments. In one, in a story in A Safe Girl to Love, Casey Pletts spectacular collections of stories published last year, Zoe (like me!) spends time with her mom, Sandy, who is herself a trans woman from an earlier generation. As in all of Pletts stories, their humanity does not hinge on their gender identities. Rather, you see a mother trying her best, a daughter rolling her eyes at mom-texts, and the two growing (or maybe just existing) through an awkward time with an undercurrent of love between them. In another, a video uploaded to YouTube, Laura Jane Grace (of Against Me!) is playing a small in-store concert, her young child watching off-stage. After dedicating Two Coffins to her daughter, Laura sings so warmly, so proudly, its as if the crowd isnt there. Ive watched the video countless times. And shortly after reading Pletts book for the first time, I learned about director Rmy Huberdeaus documentary Transgender Parents (one of the parents featured in the documentary is a trans mother-to-be). The documentary is screening at festivals in Europe this fall. We need to keep telling stories that bring us back to our own strength, and that share knowledge across generations. We can be tenacious and loving and graceful as parents, while also affirming the fucked up and scary parts of raising a child in communities that often devalue us. We can make space to worry about how well be judged how our children will be judged on our account and then we can still go ahead and be spectacular mothers. We can start having conversations about whether adoption and foster parenting is truly inclusive for trans women, as President Obama proclaimed they must be in 2014. We can bring our aspirations as parents together with an intersectional approach to addressing the barriers mothers face in our economy and our society, as Meghan Stabler has done so beautifully. And we can just hang out with our children and make space for them to be whoever they need to be. Regardless of what we were given, we can give them something more. When the elevator door closed on that Sunday afternoon, the little girl still dancing in the hallway, I realized that in having spoken the words I want to be a mom someday aloud, it was more than just a desire or a preference. It was something already taking form in me, much the same way my transition itself had appeared to me in little moments and accelerated until it was unavoidable until I was on the other side, living it. Sometimes the amount of steps between that life and this one terrifies me. But when I remember how I felt that afternoon, or how I feel watching Laura Jane Grace sing to her daughter, or making my little nephew giggle, I think of how my favorite poem by James Wright ends: Suddenly I realizeThat if I stepped out of my body I would breakInto blossom.

aS"Taylor Macs new play, Hir, is thrusting complex trans experiences into the spotlight. Onstage, wearing pancake makeup and a leopard print pillbox hat sized for a queen with a serious Oxy habit, theater artist Taylor Mac is training for a marathon. Next year, Mac will finally perform the entirety of the twenty-four-hour, 248-song cycle A 24-Decade History of Popular Music a work that puts the magnum in magnum opus. By comparison, tonights fragment is barely a sprint: Over the course of the next three hours, Mac and co. will musically guide the audience from the shtetls of Russia to the tenements of the Lower East Side, dragging us deep into the foxholes of World War I before launching us like champagne corks into the frenetic nightlife of the Roaring Twenties. Everything youre feeling is appropriate! Mac shouts repeatedly over the evening, as the audience sits, stands, and dances on command. At one point, a volunteer moons the house while Mac sweetly croons By the Light of the Silvery Moon. Later, Mac commands everyone in the audience over fifty to teach everyone under fifty a dance move of their choosing. After some mumbled introductions, a soft butch with short brown hair has me swaying my hips in lopsided figure eights. Each decade gets an hour, an outfit, and ten songs (give or take), which were popular among the specific segment of America that Mac has focused on for that span: 90s alternative lesbians, say, or turn-of-the-century Jewish immigrants. It is a queer, feminist, anti-racist version of American history, and judy (Macs stage gender pronoun) tells it with sequins, balloons, and plastic toys. Mac is very clear about not being transgender, but gender play is an integral part of his work to such a degree that hes adopted judy as an answer to the audience members who demand to know just what he is. I wanted this pronoun that would make them ridiculous as they were trying to make me ridiculous, Mac laughed. If you say judy and roll your eyes at the same time, youre immediately camp. View this image  Kevin Yatarola The Decades show emerged from a seminal moment in Macs life. As a young person growing up in Stockton, California in the 80s, the first time he ever saw out queer people, he saw thousands of them, gathered together at an AIDS protest that he stumbled upon accidentally. The mood was joyous and grim, angry and tender, sexual and political. The AIDS crisis is by no means over, but those who were engaged in that first wave will forever be bonded as veterans of a war that most Americans refused to acknowledge was happening. I wanted to make a show that was a metaphor for that experience of building community as a result of it falling apart,Mac told me over coffee, out of drag. It is through shared experience that we form community at all, he believes. By putting his audience through twenty-four-hours of non-stop performance through the decay, stress, and strangeness that comes with sitting together as your deodorant wears off and your mask comes down Mac hopes to create a kind of temporary, art-based community that eradicates the walls between audience and performer, and audience and audience. Indeed, by the end of just the three hours I saw, Id laughed, cried, met my neighbors on all sides, and recontextualized flappers as a response to World War I. When was the last time you went to the theater and actually felt something authentic? Mac asked me rhetorically as we discussed the show. By this, he meant something more than the reflected glow of the emotions of the actors. When was I made to feel something in my body? When was I moved? More than his song and dance on the stage beautiful though those are this is his true art: Breaking down the walls that keep us from feeling genuine emotion. The audience participation in the Decades show is a series of goads designed to keep us off-balance, uncertain, and in the moment. Only when we are fully present, when the detached superiority of being a spectator is taken from us, can we reach something real. I work in catharsis, Mac stated matter-of-factly, as though catharsis were a kind of paint, like oil or watercolor. You have to go through something in order to change. Thats the job of the artist: To incite change. At first glance, Macs work might appear slapdash or improvised, but dont be tricked. For all his manic energy and fantabulous visions, Mac is a rare contradiction: The earnest drag queen, the serious fool. For years, hes successfully plied his absurd blend of performance art, drag, and theater in New York Citys downtown scene. Yet despite glowing reviews in The New York Times (which called his 2009 Obie-Award winning show The Lilys Revenge a romantic odyssey spanning realms human and horticultural, spiritual and worldly, raunchy and academic), Macs work has never made it above 14th Street and onto the bigger Broadway and Off-Broadway stages. But all that will change tonight, November 8, when his kitchen-sink drama Hir opens at Playwrights Horizons. Hir is Macs first formally conventional play, as well as the first of his works that doesnt feature him in it. Yet in Hir, Mac has found a way to blend all the elements that make his personal performances so captivating the tenderness, the brilliance, the absurdity, the unease, the pain without having to act them out himself. Hir, the part of speech, is a gender-neutral singular pronoun, usually paired with ze (as in Ze would like hir cake now.) Hir, the play, is a two-act family drama done in an aesthetic that the rehearsal script describes as absurd realism. Realistic characters in a realistic circumstance that is so extreme it is absurd. Hirs subject is the Connors, a family that is approaching either total breakdown or total breakthrough. The aging, abusive patriarch has had a stroke that has left him nearly incapacitated, and he spends much of the play incoherent and in a diaper. The younger child, Max, has recently come out as transgender, and together, ze and hir mother, Paige, have been on a voyage of self-discovery through densely academic queer theory. While some humor in the play is derived from the obtuse jargon of gender, we also see its usefulness: For Paige and Max, this deep dive into trans academia has helped them free themselves from a lifetime of misogynistic and transphobic expectations and abuse. When the older, straight son comes home from the marines stricken with a case of PTSD that (among other things) makes him vomit when stressed he finds a family he barely recognizes and cannot save. Moreover, its a family who may not want or need his version of salvation. There is a woundedness at the heart of each of these characters, and they take that hurt out on each other in unexpected and terrible ways. Its an endlessly surprising, generous, scary, funny, insightful play, said Tim Sanford, the Artistic Director of Playwrights Horizons, who programmed Hir into their season. Theres a world of hurt indicated in it, and its transformed, as Taylors work often is, through extremity into a kind of absurd comedy, but it doesnt stay there. It evolves. View this image  Cameron Scoggins and Tom Phelan in Hir. Joan Marcus I wanted to write a play where all the characters are vying for the central position, Mac explained. Because thats whats happening in America right now: The former central character, the straight white male, is being evicted slowly. One of the things that makes Hir so surprising is that Mac manages to find some tenderness for its patriarch, without falling victim to the tedious trope of the straight white man who learns and grows through the work of the fill-in-the-blank minorities around him. Instead, we see what happens to those who fail to change. Without power, the petty tyrant becomes the petulant child, raging uselessly against a world that he doesnt even understand he had a hand in creating. In the end, you feel as much for him as you do the other characters. When I brought up this generosity of spirit, Mac quoted Warhol superstar and performance art legend Penny Arcade, saying a queer is someone who was ostracized as a young person to such a degree that they dont want to ostracize anyone else whether that anyone is a young genderqueer teen or an aging straight guy. Director Rachel Chavkin, who founded the experimental theater company The TEAM and who worked with Mac on The Lilys Revenge, characterized his approach as being a tent big enough to fit even those he disagrees with, which requires writing all of his characters (even the antagonists and fools) with humanity and nuance. By so doing, Taylor gets all these straight white men laughing and taking part in their own destruction, Chavkin told me. Aside from being a sort of kindness, this approach is eminently practical: If the job of the artist is to incite change, then the folks you want to change have to be in the room. That means depicting them as real people, not just foils to your main characters or one-dimensional villains. Perforce, this also requires that Macs heroes and protagonists have real flaws. While Max is sometimes the voice of reason in the play, zes still a teenager, prone to bursts of petulance and slammed doors. Isaacs actions often seem reasonable, but we see how this logical behavior is leading directly to becoming like his abusive father. And despite Paiges self-liberation through trans theory, she still enacts a kind of forced feminization as a means of degrading her formerly-abusive husband, putting him in clown-like makeup and dresses to humiliate him. Their relationship of dominance has been inverted, a purposeful move on Macs part, but one that makes Paige the most difficult character to sit with on the stage. Much like the Decades show, Hir moves rapidly between hilarious send-up and this kind of unsettling drama, keeping the audience engaged and emotionally present. Its text is so dense and surprising, audience members may have to return more than once to get the full meaning. Cisgender people writing substantively about trans people has become more common in mainstream entertainment over the last few years, from Jill Soloways Emmy-dominating TV show Transparent to Sean Bakers award-winning independent film Tangerine. While this is an improvement over transgender characters being non-existent or relegated to the role of dead prostitute in an episode of Law & Order, its not without problems: Transgender writers arent being given the tools to tell their own stories, while storylines involving trans characters are often short-lived and more about the cisgender people around them then they are about the authentic experiences of trans people. This is not a knock on Mac or Playwrights Horizons, but I find it unsurprising that Playwrights first major show with transgender content was written by a cisgender man. And theyre not alone in this. During their winter season, The Public Theater will stage a production of Southern Comfort, a musical based on the documentary about Robert Eads, a transgender man with cancer. It, too, has been written and directed by cis people. Being able to play with gender is a privilege mostly enjoyed by cisgender people, for whom the stakes of gender-transgression are generally much lower. Rudy Giuliani can safely go out wearing a dress in a way many trans women cannot. To some trans people, Macs use of judy as a performative gender pronoun might seem the height of oblivious privilege making a mockery of something that, for them, is all too often deadly serious. However, gender play can also be dangerous for gay men, for whom stereotypically feminine behaviors are often met with assault or other kinds of violence. So judy can be read as an act of solidarity a pushback against the gender-policing that various queer and gender-nonconforming people all face. View this image  Ves Pitts As a large (and growing) community, its impossible to expect all trans people will have the same response to anything. Much like the pronoun judy, Hir balances on the knifes edge of sincerity and absurdity, and its bound to have its detractors and its boosters. But as part of Macs goal is to not ostracize the transgender community, its worth asking the question: How do cisgender performers make work about gender that isnt transphobic? Joshua Bastian Cole is a PhD candidate at Cornell University, where he studies Performing and Media Arts, and specifically, trans men as actors. Last year, he made a list of excellent plays by trans-identified and trans-ally-identified playwrights, which he called The Killjoys lisT. In it, he included a rubric to try and define ally work, so I asked him his thoughts about Hir. While he was unfamiliar with the play, he said Taylor is fantastic and a major talent worth giving attention to. Yet like me, he was still troubled by the ways in which transgender plays and playwrights are kept out of institutions. Where are the plays authored and produced by trans people themselves? They exist, Cole told me flatly. Theyre just not getting produced. And when they are produced, its on a much smaller level. Cole believes that this truth complicates, but does not negate, the ability of cisgender playwrights to write trans stories. I respect the folks who are aware of the space they are taking up, he told me, and the privilege they have, and how they use that. Privilege is a form of social capital, and some of us have more than others. But how we spend that capital is our choice and Mac is actively using his to promote trans people in the world of American theater, another way in which he is living his dictum that the work of the artist is to incite change. In Macs case, that work goes far beyond just his writing. Chavkin, the director, characterized Mac as a leading voice in this field [of] artists who are being the change they want to see in the world. Take the casting process for Hir. As written in the rehearsal script, the description of the character Max ends It is important to me that the actor playing Max be someone who was a biological female and now identifies as transgender or genderqueer. Playwrights Horizons was enthusiastically on board with this requirement. But when it came time for casting, they ran into unexpected resistance from Backstage, the largest site for casting notices on the Internet, who said their electronic system required that listings be male or female. We said this is not appropriate, said Sanford, Playwrights artistic director. But when they printed it, they just picked one. To Mac, this was unacceptable. I thought, well this is going to turn off the entire transgender community, he told me. Mac was well aware that when youre a trans actor, the culture of American theater has its door shut to you so much. This was his attempt to crack the door open. After some public shaming, he succeeded in having a transgender tick box added to Backstages gender options. Southern Comfort, the forthcoming trans musical at The Public Theater, will presumably take advantage of this, as theyve announced that they are actively looking for trans singers and actors in their casting (a 2013 staging in Boston featured cisgender performers). But Mac demurs credit for the change. It had to happen eventually, he shrugged. We were just the people who asked for it first. Once the casting notice for Hir was up, the show read with a series of trans actors, and eventually cast Tom Phelan, who currently plays Cole on the ABC Family show The Fosters. Phelan had read the play when it was published in American Theater Magazine, and had wanted to play Max ever since. It feels like it was written for me, he told me over the phone. Which speaks to the immense compassion, empathy, and talent Taylor has. More than gender, more than political correctness, more than almost anything, empathy is Macs guiding principle, and the reason he is a thought leader in the world of American theater. Its also what makes him a great artist, because empathy is the ability to look at the world from the point of view of another person, be it an actor who cant get gigs because they are trans, an aging straight white guy who rages in fear at a world he cant understand, or a Jewish immigrant living in a tenement in the Lower East Side in 1900. But being empathic doesnt always mean being gentle or pulling punches. Part of the job of the artist is to care for people. Mac smiled at me as he spoke. Then a mischievous glint appeared in his eyes. But the other part is to mess them up. In different ways, Hir and the Decades show highlight Macs ability to do both these things at once. Indeed, his continual pairing of supposed opposites is what makes Macs work so powerful. He is absurd and authentic, caregiver and truth-teller, comic and tragic. If in one moment he has us laughing, and the next he has us embarrassed by that laughter, then his method is working. Contradiction, like audience participation, is a tool he uses to bring the viewer to a place of genuine emotion. And once were there, well, quoth Mac Everything youre feeling is appropriate.

aS"At Morehouse, the historically black, all-male liberal arts college in Atlanta, some students challenge both the gender binary and harmful stereotypes about black homophobia. View this image  Morehouse graduate Jamal Lewis returns for Homecoming. Bummah Ndeh Nestled in the heart of Atlantas University Center, Morehouse College is a beacon of black male excellence. Here, commencement is a celebration not simply of the newly minted graduating class, but also of the countless Morehouse Men who have paved the way for their brothers throughout the all-male colleges 148-year history among them, Spike Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The archetypal Morehouse Man, distinguished and exceptional, is a classic man in every sense: educated, suited up, and deeply invested in his community. He is hailed on campus and throughout black communities well outside Atlanta even earning a nod from President Obama himself during his controversial 2013 commencement address at the College. But for class of 2014 graduate Jamal Lewis, returning to campus to see friends walk Morehouses decorated stage this past May was a reminder of the ways this storied brotherhood does not always extend to all students. Lewis, who was raised in Atlanta, returned to campus wearing a shirt that said Morehouse Fag. What that shirt really meant for me in that moment was that I was Other, and fag was the only language that I had to really capture that otherness, Lewis, who uses he/she pronouns and identifies outside the gender binary, told BuzzFeed News. I constantly, on the daily, fail black manhood and black womanhood. And for me, fag is just that space that lies in between the two its very political, very abject, very meaningful to me because Im not trying to ascend into a respectable gender. Despite seeming like an especially bold proclamation to some, the shirt garnered a response no different from the kind of gawking Lewis has long grown accustomed to experiencing on campus. Lewiss college years were a time of constantly weighing the desire to simply express his/herself authentically against the danger or humiliation that same expression might garner in public spaces like the campus libraries, walkways, and cafeteria. Many people were staring at me which was nothing new, Lewis said. Had I had on something else outside of that Morehouse Fag T-shirt, people still wouldve looked at me strangely because they just read my body or rather, see my gender, as unintelligible. For Lewis, and countless other students whose genders do not fall neatly into the binary ascribed to them by the world at large, the balancing act of calling out their classmates and institutions queerphobia without feeding into harmful stereotypes about black people is a difficult one. Both black masculinity and black femininity are already subject to immense scrutiny and stigma in a climate that measures acceptable gender roles by their proximity to white masculinity. To call out a community already at the margins is to risk that critique being amplified by dominant voices with the effect of further stigmatizing both groups one belongs to. Black people are often depicted as being inherently more homophobic than other groups, despite the reality that they are more likely to identify as LGBT and more likely to vote in favor of marriage equality than their white counterparts. This misconception, fueled partly by the work of white gay activists who erroneously blamed the 2008 passage of Californias anti-marriage equality Proposition 8 on black voters, erases the work and experiences of black people who are queer and/or trans themselves. As single-sex campuses around the country begin to publicly grapple with the expanding expressions of gender identity, historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) are often left out of the national dialogue. The face of queer activism on campuses or otherwise is often white, affluent, and masculine. But queerness on HBCU campuses, where diversity defies simple categorization, challenges assumptions about race, gender, and sexuality alike. View this image  Bummah Ndeh Morehouses very founding, only two years after the end of the Civil War, was itself a testament to the omnipresent obstacle of anti-black racism in America. Morehouse and so many other HBCUs came to existence chiefly because black people were actively excluded from the educational opportunities afforded to whites. Though black students are no longer legally barred from attending predominately white colleges, educational institutions continue to discriminate against people of color, especially those from low-income communities, at every level. And living under the intersecting burdens of (perceived) gender and/or sexual deviance as well as anti-blackness in America makes some students especially vulnerable even in spaces ostensibly created for all black students to thrive. For queer and gender-nonconforming Morehouse students, this means either accepting intra-community policing of their gender and sexuality (like the controversial 2009 banning of womens attire) or finding ways to speak out against it and shift campus culture. At Morehouse, gender and sexuality hold as much complexity as blackness. Here, against the backdrop of (and sometimes alongside) Atlantas vibrant queer communities, students find ways to express themselves across expansive, intersecting identity spectrums. The gender-nonconforming Mean Girls of Morehouse explicitly challenged the colleges dress code in heels and makeup; more masculine-presenting queer men rebel against patriarchal standards in quieter ways. Lewis, who uses the pronoun he/she precisely because it really reckons with the gender binary head on and its just very vulgar and perfect, contends that the definition of the Morehouse Man is an all too narrow one. Rather than celebrating the diversity within black masculinities, the Morehouse Man that Morehouse chooses to uplift and promote is the one that is a very Talented Tenth, very black respectable negro, a black exceptional negro, he/she said. For students whose understanding of their own genders doesnt fit neatly into this static vision of masculinity, aspiring to that ideal can be a Sisyphean task one that Lewis, who disidentifies with the label, has no interest in. Yet even within a climate that privileges respectable expressions of masculinity, Lewis found spaces to reckon with suppression of his/her gender and challenge the status quo. Morehouse College SafeSpace, the schools alliance for gender and sexual diversities, gives students an outlet, political home, and community. For Lewis, who organized with the group all four years of his/her time at Morehouse, SafeSpace served as home base. In the tradition of black queer organizing, it addresses instances of discrimination and hostility while proactively pushing the administration to offer more concrete support to LGBT students. Black queer students undertaking that activist work do so knowing that they must struggle not only against the homophobia they face, but also against deeply entrenched perceptions of black people as being inherently homophobic. SafeSpace offers a refuge from both. Shareef Phillips, a current Morehouse junior, told BuzzFeed News that the simple act of providing outlets for students to speak candidly about their own experiences is part of what makes SafeSpace so integral to his livelihood on campus. We have an event every year where different people on the panel talk about their coming out stories, and how they came out, and how long it took them to come out, and the things they went through to come out, Phillips said. So just hearing different peoples perspectives on coming out, it definitely helps you come out yourself and know that youre not alone. The group also serves to foster nuanced dialogue within the college and on a national scale. When an open letter to the Morehouse football team was published in 2014 by a white moviegoer who found the teams vocal disdain for a gay film character deplorable, SafeSpaces then-president, Marcus Lee, responded by highlighting not only how the team misstepped, but also how those attitudes are shaped in the world more broadly and how they might be fixed. In an op-ed, he noted that the institution of Morehouse itself was complicit in supporting these attitudes, despite some individuals (including the president of the college) embracing the LGBT community in words, if not also in action. There are no Black queer studies courses, gender and sexual orientation are absent from our employment nondiscrimination policy, we have a dress code that outlaws wearing female attire, we have an inactive diversity committee, and the list continues, Lee wrote. So, I dont think the football teams reactions are inherent to them specifically. Instead, they are a product of a grooming process that begins in the world, and is buttressed or goes uninterrupted at Morehouse thats checkered with heteronormativity and silence; inclusive spaces are forged here in spite of, not because of, the culture of the college. Indeed, it is the diligent, deeply personal political work of queer student activists at Morehouse and beyond that has catalyzed the institutions push to support its LGBT community more substantively. In 2012, SafeSpace collaborated with the Sociology department to advocate for a new course: History and Culture of Black LGBT, an interdisciplinary survey of Black lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) culture and politics, as reported by the Maroon Tiger. The class was taught by Yale University professor and noted Africana studies scholar Dr. Jafari S. Allen, but it was only offered for one semester. Where academia fails to offer sustained opportunities for critical gender and sexuality inquiry, students forge their own spaces for it. One such example, the Bayard Rustin Scholars program, was named after the queer advisor to Dr. King. Rustin is often erased from civil rights movement retellings because of his sexuality. The program gives incoming freshmen the chance to learn from a targeted social justice curriculum conceived by Lewis, Lee, and another student, Kenneth Maurice Pass. For Lewis, a vision of Morehouse offering students the opportunity to be their whole selves is not only realistic, its in line with the institutions liberatory founding. There is a complexity to struggle, and Im just not really interested in pathologizing Morehouse and how black men respond to sexual and gender deviance. But Im interested in challenging and critically holding them accountable, Lewis said. Morehouse should be a place where black men are getting free, and that freedom comes from a scholarship that challenges them to reckon with the ills of the world. Lewis got the opportunity to address those ills, in the tradition of James Baldwin and Audre Lorde, by writing through and away from them, in pieces for the student paper the Maroon Tiger. The Tiger, though not a space not officially designated as being queer, challenges campus norms and offers queer students an outlet to speak up and speak back. For so long I was only writing as a contributing writer, but the time that I came in [as an admin] was as Drake and Future say it was that time to be alive, Lewis said. Both the editor-in-chief and managing editor were queer; they were my colleagues, they were my contemporaries, and they valued the insight that I brought to the table, so together with our strengths we were able to accomplish really amazing things.Among those accomplishments was the publication of a Body Issue, in which students wrote candidly about the traumas, subjugation, and experiences their bodies have withstood. The issue, which was criticized by some students when it first debuted for being too gay, is one example of what Lewis calls the queerness inherent in journalism that pushes the status quo.Instead of showcasing the bodies we want, we showcase the bodies we have adding this historical narrative around black people and their bodies and subjugation and trauma bodies holding history, and bodies as a map, Lewis said. We were able to produce an issue that confronted sexual assault, substance abuse and addiction, and sexuality and hair and all of those things that our bodies carry. View this image  Courtesy of Shareef Phillips The Tiger offered Lewis the chance to quite literally re-write narratives about gender on campus, but it is not the only arena in which queer students confront rigid standards of masculinity and build community. In the end, its the relationships between queer and trans students themselves that are really inciting change. I wasnt really sure if I was going to come to Morehouse because before I came to Morehouse I was kinda struggling with who I was if I was attracted to girls or was I attracted to guys, Phillips said. I didnt really think it was a good idea A) to go to an HBCU, and B) for it to be an all male institution. But joining SafeSpace expanded Phillips understanding of HBCU campus cultures. I had the wrong perception of what Morehouse was about, he said. Toward the end of [my first] semester I came across people who were part of the LGBTQ community. And the more and more I started hanging out with them, I figured out thats where I need to be; thats where I feel most comfortable. Perhaps the groups most important function is as a support network. It was through SafeSpace that Phillips met Lewis and found the people who made him feel emboldened to both come out and begin to present more femininely. Lewis cites slowly changing tides as one of the most rewarding aspects of the activist work he/she undertook while at Morehouse, and the motivation behind projects like Femme To Femme and #QueerHBCU that he/she is working on now. The ability to help create an environment in which younger students feel more free to express themselves and embody their wholeness is not an opportunity Lewis takes lightly. We all know as black queer people that safety has never been granted to us. It was beautiful to see that the safe space that we [alumni] created lived on in the students and in the resilience that they embody day to day on campus, Lewis said. Thats one thing Im proud of that we never really had an official space, but we had a space because it lived within the students. I got to see that when I came back home; it almost moved me to tears and I could cry now, Lewis continued. For so long I felt alone walking that campus and coming back for homecoming, to see my children as I call them, just storming the campus, just at home within their own bodies and with their own selves just whole it was amazing to see. When Phillips participated in an androgyny-themed photo shoot for a campus magazine, rocking a crop top and a face full of makeup, some fellow students said his hyper-feminine look was not what a Morehouse Man stands for. The remarks few and far between in a sea of mostly supportive comments from friends set him back internally, making him wonder if he needed to tone down his normal feminine presentation. But following in the footsteps of queer and trans students carried Phillips through the discomfort of that pushback. Jamal [Lewis] was one of the main people, but it was a lot of other people that was just being themselves on campus, Phillips said. And I thought hey, I want to be one of those people, I dont want to shelter myself from the things I want to do. Phillips is hopeful about Morehouses direction moving forward, asking simply that campus continue to evolve toward being more open-minded and understanding that all students gender expression is valid and need not be questioned or mocked. Im able to do androgynous shoots or dress this way and do this while getting my studies done and matriculating throughout Morehouse to get my degree, he said. Im doing the same thing everybody else is doing, but just doing it in a different way. At the end of the day were still your brothers, or sisters, however you identify.

aS'But actually getting the surgery will remain a challenge. View this image  As it currently stands, theres only one place in the province to get a referral for gender-affirming surgery: Torontos Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH). Those paying out of pocket can seek private care elsewhere, but for provincial insurance coverage, patients must go through CAMH. That has resulted in a massive two-year waiting list just to get that referral. However, Health Minister Eric Hoskin announced Friday that all qualified health care providers will be able to provide a referral starting in early 2016. Every Ontarian has the right to be who they are, said Hoskins, in a statement. Our health care system should reflect this vision, which is why we are improving access to gender-affirming surgery. View this image  Gapka said that when she came out 15 years ago, the province had cut its support for gender-affirming surgery. The changes that have taken place between then and 2015 are significant, but she said theres still work to be done. Gender-affirming surgeries are performed out of province, typically in Montreal. Patients who manage to get their referral just end up on another long waiting list, not to mention the prospect of travel costs. Not only is there a gatekeeping bottleneck just to be assessed for the procedures, but theres another bottleneck in acquiring the surgeries, said Gapka. .@Glen4ONT say trans people have broken down the binary of gender. Now that hard work is "paying dividends" #onpoli Trans people have high rates of suicide and mental health issues but also theyre also underemployed, underhoused and [have less] access to the social determinants of health, she said. Whatever we can do to make that access more modern and streamlined is a positive step forward.

aS"Were just trying to pee, but some people make it really, really hard. In the wake of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinances repeal earlier this week, trans and gender-nonconforming people share their stories. View this image  Johnny Jonte Boucher The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance a nondiscrimination law that protected LGBT people as well as others was repealed late on Tuesday night, largely because of widespread panic that male sexual predators (whom opponents of the law often conflated with trans women) would have uninhibited access to womens restrooms. LGBT advocates failed to drum up enough voter support for the law, despite there being no credible evidence that trans women are inclined to harass or sexually assault anyone, of any gender, while using the restroom. There is both anecdotal and criminal evidence, however, that many trans and gender-nonconforming people have been killed and thousands more harassed and insulted by people who find out that theyre trans. Sometimes, that harassment happens in restrooms. Without an antidiscrimination law, trans people live with the constant threat of being ejected from public restrooms or worse. In New York, where I live, I can be ejected from any womens restroom by someone who knows about my trans status, and I have no clear legal recourse. But going into the mens room my most legally safe option as someone assigned male at birth would mean not just uncomfortable stares, but fear of harassment or violence in an enclosed space at the hands of people who might identify me as trans. For many of us, using public restrooms is not only anxiety-inducing, but potentially dangerous. Here are some of our stories: View this image  Scarlet Tatro Im a 32-year-old trans woman with bladder problems. While laws that aim at removing discrimination from bathrooms for trans people are being struck down, there are many suffering just to find a place to use the restroom in peace. When I first started transitioning, I saw the horrible video of a trans woman being beaten at a McDonalds for trying to simply go to the bathroom in the city I live in. Because of that, I learned to do my absolute best to not use the restroom in public (especially alone) for fear of a similar fate befalling me. I have held my bowels so long that I no longer know I need to go until it is an absolute emergency. I have dreams where Im using the bathroom and wake up to it actually happening, because my fear has resulted in my body not functioning normally. No person should have to suffer from these medical conditions because of the hatred others have for them. We are more scared of being in the bathroom with cisgender people (and for actual valid reasons backed up by fact) than cisgender people can ever be scared of us. View this image  Johnny Jonte Boucher People born men freely entering womens bathrooms! People born men? That evokes some comic dystopia of newborn bogeymen marching menacingly into stalls, since, of course, people are born babies. My wife and I are devastated about the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance being struck down based on fear of trans people, being both trans and genderqueer ourselves. [When] my 4-year-old asked what a man and a woman was, I told him, Doctors take a look at your body when youre born and make their best guess at who youll be, boys [or] girls. Most of the time theyre right at that first guess, but the rest of the time we have to wait for you to tell us more about who you are. What made immediate sense to a preschooler defies the imagination of Houstonians preoccupied with strangers genitals [who are] making women less safe in doing so. Do you know whos bothered me in bathrooms before? It hasnt been transgender people, and I probably know a few hundred at this point. Its been typical cis, non-trans dudebros aggressively flirting in the bathroom. Seriously, one dude in nice loafers tried to pass me his number on a Band-Aid, through the stall. Another guy just waited outside the stall door at a bookstore, foot dangling in invitation. I cant tell you how viscerally unsafe it can feel when a dude makes intense eye contact from the urinal. In some clubs they have to take the stalls off the doors just because the general male behavior is so out of control. Its easier to whip people into a frenzy about trans women, though, than it is to look at the faces of the actual trans people who are hurt by the loss of HERO. Imagine being a woman forced in a bathroom with those guys. [Cis men] are the real bogeymen, I think. Its the folks who would rather see LGBT people in danger in the name of religious freedom. The shocking truth about trans people in your bathroom? Here to pee. Even more shocking? Were much more likely to be harassed than to harass. Loss of HERO, case in point. View this image  Rebeka Refuse Im a trans woman, and my former partner and I became homeless in New York City in 2010. We were living in her van, and its tough to find public restrooms in dense cities like New York without being a paying customer, which is impossible when one is in extreme poverty. Living in a car didnt give me access to facilities like basic self-care not just peeing but also bathing and grooming and I wanted to drop in at a center for the citys homeless to take care of myself. I had proper womens identification, but I did not know how private the restroom facilities would be and was anxious about the possibility of sharing a multiple-stall gender-segregated bathroom. So I just avoided drinking fluids as much as possible and waited until I was able to find temporary shelter from Trans Housing Network to take care of needs like bathing. Im lucky not to have experienced harassment in restrooms yet. However and this is an important point I avoid using multi-stall public bathrooms now as much as possible because the anxiety and self-consciousness about passing makes me extremely stressed out. While I was homeless, I often was in cities or states with gender identity protections enshrined in law, but the legal situation did not make me feel any more comfortable using gender-segregated bathrooms, even when I did not have any other choice. View this image  Jack Gillard When I first started transitioning as a trans man my junior year of college, I lived with three women. In typical college fashion, all the bathrooms were gendered. When I finally began to pass, I weirdly stuck out in the ladies restroom and even more so in the mens. When I had to use the bathroom I sometimes had to walk across campus to find empty restrooms or forgo going to the bathroom altogether. Even now, over two years later, I feel like every man in the restroom stares at me when I wait for a stall. More often than I care to admit, Ill walk out of the mens room if there are too many men in there. I cant say that using the mens room scares me, but I will say that I wish something as easy as peeing wasnt so difficult. I wish there were more gender-neutral restrooms. I wish that people didnt feel a claim to porcelain pots based on gender in the way that they do, and, more than anything, I wish any gender is enough. View this image  Zoe Dolan I miss two features of living in a male body: running outside shirtless, and being able to pee standing up.I do not miss male bathrooms, however, in the slightest. As a recovering sex addict, I would grit my teeth to maintain my composure whenever sexual acting out abounded in a public facility. Even the odor of commercial cleaning solution on porcelain triggered memories. Nothing seems so close to any moment in the past as a smell from memory.The last time I used a mens bathroom was during my second year of law school. I had been on estrogen for five or six months at that point, so my facial features had softened and I had grown small breasts. A guy was entering as I was leaving: He looked at me, then up at the bathroom sign, then back at me, then up at the sign again and then he went inside, shaking his head.After transition but prior to surgery, bathrooms were an exercise in identity: I took care to aim just right so that my pee hitting the water in the toilet bowl would sound like any other womans. This reminder of what was wrong with my body was excruciating.Bathrooms are safer places now that I can pee with the right body. And if I find myself wincing at the toilet seat and wishing I could pee standing up, at least I can inhale a sigh of relief because unlike men, of course, women shit roses. View this image  Funcrunch Photo It was a warm day in San Francisco. I was at a park, doing volunteer work in food distribution and vegan education. Id been on testosterone for a full year, and had been using mens restrooms exclusively that whole time, so far without incident. I was still nervous using the mens room in this park, however, as the lock on the single stall was broken. Regardless, my bladder would not be denied. I headed toward the restroom. As I entered, I heard a man on his way out say to my back, This is the mens room; the ladies room is next door. I continued into the stall without turning around and shouted, Im not a lady. I heard some mumbling and a hesitant OK as I fumbled with the stall door. I did my business with the door unavoidably cracked open, and got out as fast as possible. Since my transition, whenever Ive been misgendered, Ive always reviewed what I was wearing. Was this incident my fault because I wore a light-colored T-shirt, making my breasts more obvious than usual? Do I deserve to be called out because I refuse to wear a binder or get top surgery? How long would it be before my beard filled in maybe that would allow me more safety? After I calmed down, I realized the man probably thought he was doing me a favor, but that didnt stop me from shaking. Trans women in this situation have it even worse. We all just need to pee.

aS"It is not fair for them to make everybody else uncomfortable, the presidential candidate said. View this image  AP / Brennan Linsley / AP Ben Carson, a leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, drew quick criticism from LGBT advocates on Thursday for his proposal that transgender people use separate restrooms. It is not fair for them to make everybody else uncomfortable, Carson said in an interview with Fusion. Sitting down with the candidate in a Miami diner, reporter Jorge Ramos raised the issue of restrooms in response to a Houston voters repealing the citys equal rights ordinance on Tuesday. That law protected LGBT people and others from discrimination, but an opposition campaign claimed it allowed male sexual predators to prowl womens restrooms. Asked if transgender people should be allowed their choice or mens or womens restrooms, Carson said, How about we have a transgender bathroom? He confirmed that was absolutely his proposal. Ben Carsons hateful comments are out of touch and all candidates should immediately make clear that they disavow his dangerously transphobic views, Chad Griffin, president of the national LGBT advocacy organization Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement issued hours after the interview was posted online. Griffin added: Ben Carson cant go a week without invoking reckless and irresponsible stereotypes about the LGBT community, and his suggestion that transgender people be required to use segregated bathrooms echoes an ugly past our country should never revisit. Carson explained his thinking, telling Ramos in the interview, Its one of the things that I dont particularly like about the [LGBT] movement. I think everybody has equal rights, but Im not sure that anybody should have extra rights extra rights when it comes to redefining everything for everybody else and imposing your view on everybody else. The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, known as HERO, prohibited discrimination against 15 caterories of people including gays, lesbain, bisexuals, and transgender people. But it was the matter of transgender people using restrooms that arrested the publics attention after the campign to repeal the law dubbed it the bathroom ordinance. Commercials said that men and transgender women would be allowed under the law to sexually prey on young girls even though laws like it in about 200 cities and 17 states have led to no such incidents. The way this country was designed was live and let live, Carson said. I feel, gay people, they can do anything they want. Ramos pointed out that Carson opposes giving same-sex couples the legal right to marry. I believe marriage is between a man and a woman, Carson replied. But I dont care what somebody else thinks. They can do whatever they want. What I object to is they try to change the definitions for everybody. Carson did not explain how same-sex couples marrying or allowing a transgender person to use a restroom that corresponds with their gender identity changed definitions for others. youtube.com Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

Cory Silverberg and Fiona Smyths newest book is brilliant in its approach to giving caregivers and educators the tools they need to talk to kids about their bodies. Not only is it the first trans-inclusive book for kids, but it also uses inclusionary language and diverse representation across race, ability, gender, and sexuality, to hone in on the most important aspects of discussing sex and bodies with kids aged 8-12. It is the second in a trilogy of books the first, What Makes a Baby, is a beautiful, balanced, and many-gendered explanation of baby-making for kids aged 5-8. (While Sex is a Funny Word discusses body parts, gender, touch, and other topics related to the word sex, it doesnt delve into reproduction intercourse is being reserved for the third book, planned for release in fall 2017, which will be geared toward older kids.) Although I could have made this a list of the 7,000 things that Sex is a Funny Word does to revolutionize talking to kids about their bodies, out of respect for everyones time Ive narrowed it down to ten. It was really hard to do. View this image  Seven Stories Press Small bodies, large bodies, disabled bodies, many colored bodies, pointy bodies, curvy bodies, wrinkled bodies, all the bodies are illustrated and present throughout every page of Sex is a Funny Word in the same way that all of these bodies exist among each other in actual, real life! Though representation of many bodies shouldnt be revolutionary, most of our media childrens books included showcases white, thin bodies in ways that are often ableist, sexist, homophobic, and trans-exclusive. In this way (and many others), Silverberg and Smyths contribution to the dialogue is revolutionary: finally young people have a way to see all bodies (including their own body) represented. Yes. View this image  Seven Stories Press Kids pick up on the nuanced way that adults speak about sex, sexuality, bodies, and gender. Which means when those adults avoid talking about certain topics (or particular body parts), kids notice. When adults withhold information, kids wonder why. Often, they assume that these avoidances occur because something about those particular body parts or feelings or questions are wrong or bad. Sex is a Funny Word talks to kids about their parts, their feelings, and their questions in an honest and matter-of-fact manner. Whats more, the authors also address the fact that grown-ups sometimes avoid these topics, but assure kids that this isnt because there is something wrong with any part of them. View this image  Seven Stories Press Silverberg and Smyth are committed to showcasing gender as much more than a binary system from the very first page of the book the table of contents points to the chapter on gender under the heading Boys, Girls, All of Us. Silverberg told BuzzFeed News, Most of the progressive sex education books that are available actively exclude gender nonconformity and trans kids. They do that simply by saying that theres only two things: theres boys and girls, and boys have penises and girls have vulvas, and thats the story. So they dont say that its bad to be trans, but it just doesnt exist anywhere. View this image  Seven Stories Press While Sex is a Funny Word is certainly a book that kids can devour on their own, adults are highly encouraged to participate in the conversation. There is a message in the introduction specifically for caregivers and educators that encourages them to read the book before giving it to the child better preparing them for the conversations and questions that will certainly follow. It goes on to explain, Weve provided the framework and basic information about bodies, gender, and touch, and weve left blanks that only you and the kids in your life can fill in. While this book is an important tool in helping kids better understand themselves, talking with family members and loved ones about that understanding is necessary not to mention powerful. Kids listen and learn from the people they care about more than anyone (or anything) else in their lives! View this image  Seven Stories Press Bodies exist in the world in many ways, and not all bodies are afforded the same rights and the same protections as others. Silverberg and Smyth understand and contend with that reality, because aha! kids have bodies, and rights, too. {Image p 29, Justice means that every person and every body matters.} What happens when young people are able to talk about their bodies and understand them in a social justice context from a young age? My theory: Incredibly important awareness, and a foundation for speaking up for equality far into the future. View this image  Seven Stories Press Kids, just like anyone else, deserve privacy but oftentimes, they are made to feel that nothing, not even a quiet space, is theirs for the taking. Whats more (and this goes back to the private parts vs middle parts illustration above), requests for privacy are sometimes met with suspicion, especially where kids are concerned. The truth is that even young kids may want to keep certain spaces or feelings to themselves. When conversations happen around privacy, it can lift a lot of the shame that young people feel when they do want their own space, and allow them to better explore and understand themselves, their bodies, and their feelings. View this image  Seven Stories Press Each and every person (children included) has different ways that they like, and dont like, to be touched. Silverberg and Smyth tackle consent in age-appropriate ways, explaining that sometimes we may want to be touched, and other times we may not want to be touched. Using a hug as an example, they also explain that while sometimes we may want a hug at first, we may feel like we dont want one later and it is always okay to say so. This conversation around consent happens in the chapter on touch, which then goes on to talk about secret touching, or sexual abuse. Silverberg told BuzzFeed News, I knew we needed to deal with sexual abuse in the book because often sexual education books dont do that. That makes no sense to me, because its part of peoples reality. One of the really painful and complicated realizations I came to early on when I was writing this was that a lot of kids who read this book will have already experienced sexual abuse. We never write books for those kids. The only books that are written for those kids are dark, scary books about sexual abuse I want those kids to pick up this book and find themselves in it. View this image  Seven Stories Press As you might imagine in a book that has already included many genders, many body types, and all-around inclusion of multiple identities, Sex is a Funny Word also showcases several renderings of what a family might look like, and also leaves room for many sexualities in its crushes section. Again and again, on literally every page, Silverberg and Smyth reinforce that all sexualities are valid, all bodies are beautiful, and all identities deserve a space (within this book, and within the world at large!). Seven Stories Press More often than not, we tell kids that they dont understand their feelings or, even worse, that we as adults understand their feelings more than they do. Validating a childs experience of their own body and their own identity allows them to explore those feelings, and establish a healthy relationship with themselves and those around them. Beyond this, the authors also touch on how the perceptions (and assumptions) of others are not always in line with the way we experience ourselves. There may be no more powerful message than allowing kids to trust their feelings, and giving them the confidence to share those feelings with those close to them. Above and beyond anything else, this book every last page of it is made for kids. While it exists as an incredible tool for caregivers and educators, it puts the experience of young people at its core and validates their feelings, ever-shifting and growing as they are, at every turn. It encourages questions, it gives a voice to those whose voices are often silenced or hidden, it acknowledges experiences that can be confusing or scary, and it tells the truth, 100% of the time. Im moved by it all the time, Silverberg says. I still sometimes cry when I read these books in nice ways, and sometimes in not nice ways. Sometimes I cry because I wish that I had these books when I was growing up. View this image  Seven Stories Press  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .

aS"We will work closely with the Houston Super Bowl Host Committee to make sure all fans feel welcomed at our events, an NFL spokesman said.  View this image  NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. AP / Christian K. Lee The NFL will still hold the Super Bowl in Houston, Texas, even though voters repealed the citys LGBT nondiscrimination law Tuesday night a vote that some warned would spur boycotts of the city that would limit business and prompt the NFL to withdraw the 2017 championship game. However, NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told BuzzFeed News in a statement Wednesday, this will not affect our plans for Super Bowl LI in 2017. We will work closely with the Houston Super Bowl Host Committee to make sure all fans feel welcomed at our events, he said. Our policies emphasize tolerance and inclusiveness, and prohibit discrimination based on age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or any other improper standard. The host committee referred questions to the NFL. A Change.org petition Wednesday called on NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to revoke the Houston game, and many people on social media were calling for boycotts of the city. Mayor Annise Parker spoke in general terms about fearing a direct economic backlash to the vote. On Wednesday afternoon, the Human Rights Campaign the largest LGBT group in the U.S. and a prominent funder of a failed campaign to uphold the nondiscrimination law pressed Goodell for an emergency meeting. The groups executive director, Chad Griffin, wrote in a letter that he wanted to convene advocacy organizations and league official to discuss the urgent need for a nondiscrimination ordinance in this city that will ensure the thousands of employees, contractors and attendees at this event will be fully protected under the law. Commissioner Goodell, the plea said, you have emphasized the NFLs commitment to diversity and inclusion, respect and fairness. Out of that commitment we hope you will work with us to find a path forward in Houston. McCarthy said the NFL will respond to the letter accordingly, but did not elaborate. On Wednesday evening, Dan Gavitt, NCAA vice president of mens basketball championships, released a statement regarding the NCAA hosting Final Four tournaments in Houston in the future: The NCAA remains committed to hosting the Final Four and its many fan-related events in Houston so they are open and accessible for all. The NCAA has no plans to move the 2016 Final Four, as it takes years to plan and implement this world-class event. We will continue our work with the Houston Local Organizing Committee to provide an inclusive environment for the student-athletes competing in and visitors attending our games and events in April. This vote, however, could impact the NCAA returning to Houston for a future Final Four. There are many factors in a thorough bid process that the NCAA considers when determining what cities will host the Final Four, including but not limited to local, city and state laws and ordinances. In a crushing defeat for LGBT advocates, Houston voters repealed the citys nondiscrimination ordinance in a 61% to 39% vote. Known as HERO, the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance protected 15 classes of people, including gays, lesbians, transgender people, people of color, and people of faith. Critics had claimed the law would allow male sex predators to prowl womens restrooms a claim that law enforcement officials said was baseless. Bob McNair, owner of the Houston Texans, had given the repeal campaign $10,000 but withdrew the sum after a public outcry and the campaign used his name to promote the groups message.

Oshiro, whos a big fan of Brownsteins band Sleater Kinney, described the whole thing as being surreal. Shes very inspirational, Oshiro told BuzzFeed Life. In her memoir, she talked about what it means to be a fangirl. It really validated how we feel as fans, knowing she doesnt think of us as annoying. That Amy Poehler was there to lead the in conversation-style book talk was an added bonus. Oshiro told BuzzFeed Life that she and Hernandez got their marriage license on their lunch break on the same day as the book talk. During the Q&A portion of the event, Oshiro went up to the microphone and asked Brownstein to do the honors. Everyone cheered, and Carrie put her head in her hands, Oshiro said. Amys jaw dropped, and she was like, You have to do it, you have to do it! Luckily, Brownstein had her ministry papers on hand.

aS"Jackie Biskupski said she was deeply humbled after taking the lead over incumbent Ralph Becker on election night, and her victory became official on Tuesday. View this image  Rep. Jackie Biskupski looks on during a Salt Lake City Mayor debate with Mayor Ralph Becker at the studios of KUED-TV in Salt Lake City. Rick Bowmer / AP Following the Nov. 3 election, Jackie Biskupski took 52.19% of the vote to incumbent Ralph Beckers 47.81%. In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Biskupski said she was deeply humbled by the outpouring of support I have received. The Salt Lake Tribune declared Biskupski the victor, though as of election night only about 46% of the votes had been counted and Becker did not concede. On Tuesday, the Salt Lake City Recorders Office announced the official results: Biskupski had taken 51.55% of the vote to Beckers 48.45%. When initial results came in showing Biskupski had taken the lead, the crowd at her campaign headquarters erupted into cheers, according to journalists at the scene. HUGE CHEERS for Jackie! Biskupski joined a relatively small group of openly gay U.S. mayors that includes Annise Parker of Houston and Ed Murray of Seattle. Biskupski first ran for, and won, a seat in Utahs House of Representatives in 1998. Her victory made her the first openly gay elected official in the state. On her website, Biskupski touts a record of standing up for LGBT families on issues like adoption and the fight for anti-gay bullying legislation to protect students in Utah schools. But Becker is a well-known friend of Utahs LGBT community as well. When same-sex marriage became legal in Utah just days before Christmas in 2013, Becker showed up at the county clerks office and performed marriages himself. Perhaps most significantly for this election, Becker won important endorsements from LGBT advocates in the state. View this image  Becker, center in red, marries Natalie Dicou, left, and Nicole Christensen, right, on Dec. 20, 2013. Kim Raff / ASSOCIATED PRESS While Utah is very red, Salt Lake City tends to be a reliable outpost of blue. Before Becker, Salt Lake City was led by Rocky Anderson another LGBT-friendly Democrat who pushed environmental issues, opposed the Iraq war, and in 2011 launched a new political party. The last time the city elected a Republican mayor was in 1971. Salt Lake City is home to the headquarters of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or Mormon Church, which is culturally conservative and has supported anti-same-sex marriage laws, including and most famously Proposition 8 in California. But the city is also home to a thriving LGBT community, and while those two cultures are sometimes at odds, they also, sometimes, are not. Case in point: Both sides came together earlier this year to pass a non-discrimination bill. View this image  Becker and Biskupski are visible on a screen during a debate in October. Rick Bowmer / AP During the campaign, Biskupski won endorsements from organized labor and unveiled a plan she said would streamline the bureaucratic process for businesses. Becker who finished second to Biskupski in the primary countered that he would be better able to manage the citys thriving economy. He also cast himself as a moderate and courted Republicans.

Kitchen, his (now) husband, and two lesbian couples sued over Utahs Amendment 3, which defined marriage as being only between a man and a woman. In response to the suit, a judge overturned the amendment in December 2013. In May, Kitchen said that he felt energized after the lawsuit and decided to channel his sense of momentum into running for city council, Salt Lake City Weekly reported. I felt empowered to put my voice and my energy behind something that I cared about, and I thought that the city council would be a great way to continue that, Kitchen said.

aS"In an election watched around the U.S., opponents won by a landslide after alleging the ordinance would let male predators prey on young girls in bathrooms. View this image  Campaign for Houston supporters check election results at a watch party, Tuesday Nov. 3. AP / Pat Sullivan Houston voters on Tuesday repealed a city law that protected LGBT people and others from discrimination. The decisive vote was a setback to progressive organizations that tried to uphold the ordinance and a victory for Christian conservatives who ran a campaign alleging the law would allow men to attack women in public bathrooms. With nearly all precincts reporting, results showed voters repealing the law by 61% to 39%, according to the Harris County Clerks Office. We are celebrating tonight! Jared Woodfill, the chief spokesman of the repeal effort, told BuzzFeed News in a phone call from an election night party. We dont believe that males regardless of whether they are transgender or cross-dressers or someone who identifies as a woman should be able to go into a female restroom, shower, or locker room under the protection of law, he said. Houstonians were alarmed by the laws very scary provisions, he said, and they resented national organizations outspending his campaign 5-to-1 trying to uphold the law. I think it was clearly David versus Goliath, but like the story, tonight David was successful, he said. A yes vote for Prop. 1 would have upheld the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, known as HERO; a no vote repealed it. It's not the news we wanted, but #HERO is repealed. This setback is temporary. Together, we fight on. Houston Unites, the campaign attempting to uphold the law, said results would be very close. A poll in mid-October found support for upholding HERO was ahead 43%37%, with 20% of voters undecided. But on Tuesday, the campaign lost by a chasm. The group conceded defeat while decrying the ugliest of smear campaigns run by the opposition. The battle in Houston had gained national attention as a flashpoint in a larger war over culture and LGBT rights. Supporters of the law argued that the nondiscrimination policy, passed by the city council in 2014, protected LGBT people and wide range of other groups. Critics, however, fixated on provisions of the law that ban discrimination on the basis of gender identity and promoted a message that the law must be repealed in order to keep male sex predators out of womens bathrooms. View this image  Actor Sally Field at a campaign event Wednesday to uphold the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance. Courtesy of the Human Rights Campaign We are disappointed with todays outcome, but our work to secure nondiscrimination protections for all hard-working Houstonians will continue, said a joint statement from the groups behind the effort the ACLU of Texas, Equality Texas, NAACP Houston Branch, Texas Freedom Network, Freedom for All Americans, and the Human Rights Campaign. David Welch, executive director of the Houston Area Pastors Council, cast those groups as special interests. Why would we violate a womans privacy just to satisfy a small minority who is gender confused? he asked. Its a bad law, and I think the people of Houston agreed. Called HERO for short, the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance did not directly address bathrooms. It banned discrimination on the basis of race, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, and 10 other characteristics. HERO covered jobs, housing, and places of public accommodations including public restrooms. As such, transgender women could not be barred from womens restrooms under the law. The primary impetus for the ordinance, introduced by Mayor Annise Parker and passed by the city council in May 2014, was to protect LGBT Houstonians. The policy has been on hold pending the outcome of Tuesdays vote. Woodfill, a lawyer, said Houston voters were perturbed the law covered gender identity. He said the provision allowed men and he considers transgender women to be men to enter womens restrooms simply based on how they feel. I think that was something that was extremely objectionable to the people in this city, Woodfill said. View this image  AP / Pat Sullivan After winning marriage at the Supreme Court in June, leaders of top LGBT organizations endeavored to pass laws prohibiting discrimination in cities, states, and eventually the whole country. A bill in Congress, the Equality Act, was introduced in July. But rather than pass more laws, advocates were playing defense in Houston attempting to uphold a law already on the books. Houston Unites far outspent its opposition, raising well over than $3 million, and ran commercials stressing that the law protected a wide range of people particularly veterans from discrimination. Matt McTighe, executive director of LGBT advocacy group Freedom for All Americans, said civil rights efforts typically encounter temporary losses and roadblocks, adding, Our opponents took their scare tactics to new heights. Campaign for Houston dubbed it the bathroom ordinance in ads, yard signs, and mailers. As BuzzFeed News reported, many voters knew only of that bathroom issue. Texass Gov. Greg Abbot and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick both advocated to repeal the law with a bathroom message. In other Texas cities that ban discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation plus roughly 200 cities and 17 states around the U.S. there are no clear examples of the laws being abused for men to be inappropriate in restrooms. Woodfill could cite no examples of nondiscrimination laws in other jurisdictions allowing men to commit lewd acts in womens restrooms, but that was beside the point, he said. The opposition had raised that argument, said Woodfill. Their point was, wait till the damage is done and then we will pick up the pieces. But even if the gender-identity component were removed, Woodfill said, he would still oppose the law. Most of the classes addressed in HERO are protected under state or federal law; sexual orientation is not, but he does not think any nondiscrimination laws should apply to gays and lesbians. I think they should be treated as everyone else, he said. I dont think they should receive special protections. I dont think homosexuality is an immutable characteristic. BuzzFeed News asked Woodfill, a Christian, if he also thinks nondiscrimination protections should be lifted for religion? Absolutely not. 3.

aS"The U.S. Department of Education ruled that the school discriminated against the student by restricting her access to the girls locker room. View this image  Catherine Lhamon, Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights in the Department of Education Larry French / Getty Images The U.S. Department of Education on Monday found that a school district just outside of Chicago violated anti-discrimination laws when it sought to regulate a transgender students use of the girls locker room. School officials told the student, who plays on girls sports teams and is referred to as a girl by her teachers and fellow classmates, that she was not allowed to change clothes behind a curtain in the girls locker room. She is identified as Student A in the federal ruling. A letter issued to Township High School District 211 by the Department of Educations Office of Civil Rights (OCR) read that the office had found by a preponderance of evidence that the District is in violation of Title IX for excluding Student A from participation in and denying her the benefits of its education program, providing services to her in a different manner, subjecting her to different rules of behavior, and subjecting her to different treatment on the basis of sex. In a statement sent to BuzzFeed News, Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine Lhamon said, All students deserve the opportunity to participate equally in school programs and activities this is a basic civil right. Unfortunately, Township High School District 211 is not following the law because the district continues to deny a female student the right to use the girls locker room, she added. Lhamon argued that it is possible for the district to provide access to this student while also respecting all students privacy. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) brought the case against Township High School District 211 in December 2013, and has represented the student throughout the investigation. John Knight, who directs the LGBT and HIV Project of the ACLU of Illinois, said in a statement that Townships insistence on separating my client from other students is blatant discrimination. Rather than approaching this issue with sensitivity and dignity, the District has attempted to justify its conduct by challenging my clients identity as a girl. The ACLU noted that because of her age, the student has asked not to be identified, and has declined media requests. In an ACLU statement, though, she expressed her reaction to Mondays news. This decision makes me extremely happy, she said, because of what it means for me, personally, and for countless others. She added, The districts policy stigmatized me, often making me feel like I was not a normal person. In response to the OCRs letter, Township High School District 211 issued a statement defending its stance. We do not agree with their decision and remain strong in our belief that the Districts course of actions, including private changing stations in our locker rooms, appropriately, serves the dignity and privacy of all students in our educational environment, the statement read. In an interview with the New York Times, Township High School district superintendent Daniel Cates said that his office had worked long and hard to develop a plan for the student that would take into consideration the rights of everyone involved. Cates called the Department of Educations ruling a a serious overreach with precedent-setting implications in a statement to the Times, and has indicated that the district will continue to defend its policy in court. BuzzFeed News has reached out to Township High School District 211 administration for comment. The Department of Education has long held the position that Title IX is intended to protect the rights of transgender students. In April 2014, the department issued a formal guidance outlining the specific protections. Township High School District 211 is not the first school to garner a federal investigation for violating a transgender students rights. In 2013, Arcadia Unified School District reached a settlement with the Department of Education after it was found to have discriminated against transgender students. The Department of Educations decision makes clear that what my school did was wrong, the student said. I hope no other student, anywhere, is forced to confront this indignity. It is a good day for all students, but especially those who are transgender all across the nation.

aS"When I lived as a gay man, I was attracted to the straight-acting masculine men popularized in porn but since living as a woman, my tastes have radically changed. View this image  Ben King for BuzzFeed News A couple of years ago I found myself messaging guys on OkCupid, asking if anyone wanted to see a matinee of Twelfth Night with me at 2 that same afternoon. I had lined up earlier in the day to get rush tickets, but the friend I was supposed to go with ended up canceling, so I needed to find someone else. Ill go with you, one of the guys immediately wrote back. By the way, my names Gary. I enjoy the randomness of dating online. I didnt even look closely at Garys profile before I asked him out after his initial message, just gleaned from his use of you instead of u and his curiosity about literature that he was a decent enough guy. He was beardier than my usual, clean-cut nerdy type, but if anything else, I figured it would be fun to spend the afternoon with someone I would have never met otherwise. More than a decade after medical transition, I was a lot more relaxed about dating and being trans. It used to be at the forefront of my mind every time I went out with a guy when to tell him and how so that he wouldnt freak out. But over the years, I learned that most men have never dated a trans woman before, and disclosing to them also meant that I was teaching them how to react to me. If I acted like it was something to be ashamed of, then that was what I was teaching them. But if presented it as one of many parts that made me interesting, then they were a lot less likely to care. When I first saw Gary, I wondered if I should be a little embarrassed because of his outfit. He wore a puffy blue vest over red flannels, and his beard had flecks of gray I didnt notice from his pictures, though his alert, deep-set eyes and ruddy cheeks communicated an open disposition. He stooped down to hug me and I felt his back muscles flex, though I didnt feel the pull of attraction; I was too distracted by the thought of being in the theater with a guy dressed like a lumberjack. Im excited, Gary told me. Ive never been to a Broadway show. Do you know the play? I studied it in college, I said, trying to keep my Shakespeare fandom in check. Garys sweetness made me reprimand myself for being snobby about his clothes. As soon as we got to our standing-only places in the back of the orchestra section, I couldnt help but tell him about how I saw several productions back when I lived in London. Rather than glazing over, his eyes widened as I kept talking about Shakespeare. Most guys in the city find my nerdy interests cute, yet boring. Gary found them impressive, a taste of the urbane New York culture he craved. (He had moved to Inwood to be closer to the city, and drove upstate four days a week to work as a ranger for one of the state parks.) And even the womens parts are played by men? Gary asked at one point, his eyebrow arched. It hadnt even occurred to me until then that it might be awkward for someone like me to see a play on a date where half the cast was in female drag. I cooly told him how women were banned from the theater in Shakespeares time, so men normally played all the womens roles back then. In Twelfth Night, the main character Viola spends a lot of the play pretending to be a man, so the actor who plays her has to be a man who plays a woman playing a man and by the end, we learn she also has an identical boy twin, Sebastian. All this gender shifting was a big part of why it was my favorite Shakespeare play, since I have a history of gender shifting myself. I didnt mention that part to Gary, as the house lights dimmed and the play started. I can tell theyre men playing women but theyre really convincing, Gary whispered to me after a few minutes. How do they do that? Theyre great actors, I whispered back, amused by the irony, knowing by his tone that he had no inkling of my history. I wondered if he would think of my womanhood as an act. Yet having lived as both a man and a woman, Ive learned that its all an act; everyone is performing their gender all the time, and some of us are just more talented or convincing than others in our respective roles so convincing even to ourselves that we often forget were playing them. If Im rare, its only that Ive played both parts. View this image  Gary and I walked out into the cold March air after the three-hour matinee. It was a cloudy day so the sky was already half dark. By then, I pretty much knew I wouldnt be interested in a second date he was nice but we didnt have enough in common so I didnt feel any pressure to tell him Im trans. Why dont I take you out to a nice dinner? he asked. And when he saw hesitation in my face, he added, in exchange for taking me to the play. What do you feel like? Dinner couldnt hurt. I pondered for a bit and told him I was in the mood for French. There was a bistro in Chelsea I liked. He seemed to enjoy the idea of strolling in the city with me, and put out his arm for me to hold on to as we walked. His biceps were definitely bigger than the boys I usually dated, who tended to be indoorsy artists or scientists. As we walked the 20 or so blocks down Seventh Avenue, I watched the neighborhood slowly evolve from the chaos of midtown to the more focused energy of Chelsea, its mixture of twee restaurants and the occasional gay bar or adult store. It was early so there were only a few people at the restaurant, a man reading alone and a couple of guys talking intimately. All of a sudden, I felt like a tourist with Gary and his flannels, even though Id been at the restaurant several times. Though the restaurant billed itself as a casual bistro, it wasnt nearly as cheap as I remembered. Gary insisted on wine with dinner, so I imagined the meal was probably still a lot pricier than he was used to. He didnt seem to mind. He asked me if Ive been to France and I told him I used to go reasonably often, back when I lived with a British guy for a few years. The detail I neglected to mention was that my ex-boyfriend is gay, I dated him while I was a guy, and I havent been to France as a woman. In a way, I wasnt the one who traveled there, but my identical male twin. I just want to let you know, even if we never see each other again, Gary said near the end of our meal, this was a special night for me. Meeting women like you is exactly why I moved closer to the city. Thats really sweet, I said, as we clinked glasses, his smile already tinged with loneliness. I pitied him a little then. Counter to the stereotype about trans women thats been drilled into people by movies and TV, it was just as likely for a guy to be more into me than the other way around, even after he knew about my history. After he paid the bill, he pulled out his chair to go to the restroom, not noticing the guy who had been seated behind him in the meantime. Garys chair bumped into the guys as he stood up. Oh, sorry, Gary said. I dont mind, the guy replied. You can bump into me any time. One of his companions added, You can bump into me, too. Gary turned to me with a furrowed brow, which seemed more like confusion than displeasure. He passed the waiter on his way to the bathroom, who smiled at him again. I looked around the restaurant and noticed a couple of other faces, who were clearly amused by the exchange. They looked at me approvingly, as did the guys that Gary bumped into. It was then when I realized: Gary was not just a gay mans fantasy, but he was my gay mans fantasy. Before transition, I used to watch those porn movies where gay men lured or paid straight men to have gay sex for the first time. And those straight guys had these manly jobs like fireman or marine or, actually, park ranger. They symbolized the kind of elusive masculinity that femme gay men like me both aspired to and desired, but couldnt have yet somehow, there was always something about a guy being actually gay that ruined the image. For me (and a certain cross section of gay men), it was the ultimate thrill to have sex with a guy who isnt really attracted to men, but somehow gets convinced to do so anyway. As Gary meandered his way through the restaurant and other pairs of eyes trained on him, I noticed things I didnt before. His jaw was stronger than I remembered, his chest broader. His expression, which up to then I thought of as a bit clueless, seemed rugged in this new light. I remembered that thrill of long ago: the fantasy of being with a guy who wasnt really into men. Shall we go? he asked. We were going to different subways. Gary offered to walk me, but I was too confused by my newfound attraction to take the offer, so I told him it was fine. I hugged him goodnight as he kissed me on the cheek, and I enjoyed the brush of his beard against my skin. As I walked to the station, I thought about those fleeting moments when my body was in contact with Garys, and felt the old excitement of my gay mans fantasy. I remembered, in my early days of transition, the thrill of straight guys hitting on me who would have never given me the time of day when I still lived as a gay man, and how I happily had sex with them for fun. I didnt transition to fulfill the fantasy of sleeping with lots of straight guys my desire to be a woman was so much more encompassing and complicated than that but the knowledge that men wanted me as a woman definitely sped up the process. As time went on, I craved the random sex less and less, got more excited by shared interests and the prospects of future companionship. Not feeling objectified just for my looks became a priority for me, after being consistently seen by men as nothing but a body to fuck, and it became more important for me to feel safe with guys I dated. As my core group of friends shifted from gay men to cisgender women, I began to adopt social attitudes that were more typical of my new role. I might have an identical twin whos a man, but even though were both attracted to men, the type of guy I fantasized about when I was still a guy, I suddenly realized, was no longer the type of guy I wanted in my role of woman. For a moment, I saw Gary through the eyes of the men in the restaurant. I recovered some of that old lust, and thought about texting Gary to tell him I wanted him to walk me to the subway after all. Maybe I would bring him all the way to bed, relive the fantasies of my past. And the whole time were together, I would imagine those gay men who lusted after him but couldnt have him. Those men, who used to eye me with disdain as too femme, would now envy me for being able to have not just Gary, but as many straight guys like him as I wanted. Except I no longer wanted guys like Gary. So I let the envy of those men trail off behind me as I entered the bright fluorescent light of the subway station, walked through the turnstile, and took the train home.

aS"A trans woman is actually played by a trans woman. (Warning: spoilers ahead!) View this image  If you havent seen last Thursdays epsiode of HTGAWM, you should get on it! The murder case Annalise worked on during the show involved one of her professor colleagues, Jill Hartford, killing her husband after years of domestic abuse. But heres the thing: unbeknownst to Annalise or her other colleagues, the professor turns out to be trans. This isnt the first time trans issues have been brought up in a Shonda Rhimes show; last seasons Greys Anatomy featured a trans subplot involving a doctors sibling coming out as a trans woman. But this is Shondalands most substantial exploration of trans for the folliwng reasons: View this image  When we see so many trans roles go to cisgender actors, its wonderful that HTGAWM cast a trans woman in this substantial guest role. View this image  Her most recent role is as Mauras good friend Davina in the Amazon hit series Transparent, but Billings was also the first openly trans woman to play a trans woman on TV in Romy and Michele: In the Beginning. Maybe someday, she can also be the first trans woman to have a lead role in a network TV show. What do you think, Shonda? View this image  A police detective pulls up Jill Hartfords file and finds out that she was assigned male at birth. The detective *assumes* that the reason Jill killed her husband was because they got into a fight after he found out that shes trans. You lied to your husband about what you are! the detective shouts at her. But Annalise is unflappable when she finds out about Jills trans status, and has no hesitation continuing to defend her friend. Way to be a good trans ally Annalise! View this image  When Annalise asks Jill why she planted false evidence to try to strengthen her self-defense case, Jill gets real about how the justice system is stacked against trans women. Jill cites the real-life case of CeCe McDonald, a black trans woman who ended up in jail for three years after defending herself against a transphobic attacker. Her story will be the subject of the upcoming documentary, FREE CeCe, co-produced by another groundbreaking trans actress, Laverne Cox. View this image  Annalise confronts the district attorney about Jills case, and tries to convince him to drop the charges in part because his reputation might get damaged by his support of the transphobic detective. In Shondaland, transphobia can cause a public outcry and get you fired, and the whole world should be the same. View this image  After charges against Jill are dropped, she only feels relief for escaping her abusive husband, who kept reminding her that no one would ever love her except for him because shes trans. Now that her husbands dead, Jill can move on with her life and find happiness. View this image  So okay, the circumstances are kinda grim, but Annalise as a black woman and Jill as a trans woman are both presented as undesirable by society. But after their awful white husbands died, they both realized that they have no reason to feel inferior to them just because theyre white men.

aS"The Northern Ireland Assembly has voted for same-sex marriage for the first time, but a petition of concern means it will not become law. Peter Muhly / AFP / Getty Images Getty The Northern Ireland Assembly voted on Monday in favour of same-sex marriage for the first time, but it will still not be made law. The final vote revealed 53 MLAs had voted aye to the motion to introduce marriage for all 50.5% of the assembly. Those 53 comprised 41 nationalists, four unionists, and eight others. Fifty-two voted against the motion, 51 of whom were DUP members, and one other. It is the fifth time the assembly has voted on the issue. View this image  NI Assembly Despite the majority supporting marriage rights for same-sex couples, the petition of concern, previously introduced by the DUP, prevents the outcome of the vote being made law. This petition a quirk of the Northern Ireland Assembly which functions like a veto means same-sex marriage can be enacted only when 60% vote in favour overall, along with at least 40% of both nationalists and unionist members. View this image  The debate in session NI Assembly The vote came after an impassioned debate on both sides. Jim Allister, MLA and leader of the TUV (Traditional Unionist Voice), described same-sex marriage as a perverse definition of marriage which, if granted, would be pandering to the pretence that there is some right being denied. He added: Its not a rights issue, or an issue of equalitytheres a phoney demand for rights, and spoke of the fatuous suggestion that same-sex marriage is the same as regular man/woman marriage. View this image  Jim Allister MLA Allisters sentiments were echoed by Arlene Foster, the minister of finance and personnel, who questioned whether this debate is the best use of the assemblys time. She alleged that the emails she had received in support of the motion were essentially drafted by Amnesty [International], and claimed to have received abuse from supporters of same-sex marriage because of her opposition to it. The debate concluded with a protracted plea for equality from Sinn Fein MLA Caitrona Ruane, who said, We want to join the nations that have supported marriage equality, before listing the more than 20 countries that have introduced it, including the Republic of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and England. In reference to previous comments suggesting that such a motion, heard for the fifth time, was a waste of time, Ruane retorted: The Suffragettes had to bring many motions forward before people listened to the right of women to vote. She added: If a majority of this assembly vote Yes, it would send a powerful message around the globe, before condemning the attempts by the DUP to block it from becoming law: They are using a petition of concern to discriminate against an entire community. Ruane attacked the argument from previous speakers who alluded to the detrimental effect same-sex marriage might have on children. Following the vote, The Rainbow Project, Northern Irelands principle organisation backing same-sex marriage, said in a statement: We have won the vote. We have won the hearts and minds. Now we have to fight for the right. Other campaigners for same-sex marriage reacted with frustration and anger at the vote being blocked by the petition of concern. The DUP overruled a majority of NI MLAs & public opinion to block #MarriageEquality once again. Absolute disgrace A historic day. Majority in the Assembly for #MarriageEquality & DUP choose to veto it. History will be the judge. Historic first @niassembly w/ majority of MLAs voting #yesequality to #marriageequality Motion failed due to DUP PoC The DUP may have won the day, with abuse of a POC, but they lost the vote & are losing the argument. #anotherstepforward #marriageequality The vote follows a march on Belfast in June of 20,000 people demanding same-sex marriage the largest of its kind in Northern Irelands history. A legal challenge will now be brought to the Northern Irish courts in order to bypass the political obstacles and introduce same-sex marriage.  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Feminisms focus on women can be alienating to queer people and anyone questioning the gender binary. But it doesnt have to be. View this image  Charlotte Gomez / BuzzFeed Ive never felt quite like a woman, but Ive never wanted to be a man, either. For as long as I can remember, Ive wanted to be something in between. To quote Ruby Rose: I called myself a girl, but only because my options were limited. I always assumed that everyone felt that way. I discovered my mistake one day in junior school, when a few of the girls in my class were chatting about what boys they fancied. I wasnt often invited to participate in these sorts of secret female chats. Even back then, there was something odd about me, a strangeness that was partly about identity but also about the fact that I wore shapeless black smocks, rarely brushed my hair, and tended to jump when anyone spoke to me. I couldnt think of anything to say that would be both interesting and true. So I mentioned that I often felt like I was a gay boy in a girls body. Just like everyone else, right? I could tell from their faces that this was not right. It was very, very wrong. This was a time before Tumblr, when very few teenagers were talking about being genderqueer or transmasculine. The women Id heard of who were allowed to dress and talk and behave like boys were all lesbians. I often wished I was a lesbian. But I almost always fancied boys, and if you fancied boys, you had to behave like a girl. And behaving like a girl was the one subject, apart from sports, that I always failed. It was around this time that I first read second-wave feminist Germaine Greer. She seemed to explain fundamental truths that every other adult in my small universe of school, home, and the library seemed equally anxious to ignore, and it helped that there were also dirty jokes. I clung to The Female Eunuch with the zeal of a convert and the obsession of a prepubescent nerd. I wrote Greer a letter with my very favorite pens and almost imploded with excitement when she wrote back, on a postcard that had koalas on it. I resolved right then and there that one day I would be a feminist and a writer just like her. According to Greer, liberation meant understanding that whatever you were in life, you were a woman first. Her writing helped me understand how society saw me and every other female person Id ever met. We were not human beings first: We were just girls. Looking back, though, that militant insistence on womanhood before everything is part of the reason its taken me a decade to admit that, in addition to being a feminist, Im genderqueer. That Im here to fight for womens rights, that I play for the girls team, but I have never felt like much of a woman at all. View this image  I grew up on second-wave feminism, but that didnt stop me starving myself. I was anorexic for large parts of my childhood and for many complex, painful, altogether common reasons, of which gender dysphoria was just one. I felt trapped by the femaleness of my body, by my growing breasts and curves. Not eating made my periods stop. It made my breasts disappear. On the downside, it also turned me into a manic, suicidal mess, forced me to drop out of school, and traumatized my entire family. At 17, I wound up in the hospital, in an acute eating disorders ward, where I stayed for six months. The window in my hospital room did not open more than a crack. Just wide enough to sniff a ration of fresh air before I got weighed in the morning. I turned up with all my curves starved away, with my hair cropped close to the bones of my skull, androgynous as a skeleton, insisting that people call me not Laura, but Laurie a boys name in England. I was too unwell to be pleased that I finally looked as genderless as I felt. At that point, I just wanted to die. Mostly of shame. Long story short: I didnt die. I got better. But not before I let some well-meaning medical professionals bully me back onto the right side of the gender binary. Psychiatric orthodoxy tends to lag behind social norms, and doctors are very busy people. So its not their fault that, less than 20 years after homosexuality was removed from the official list of mental disorders, the doctors treating me took one look at my short hair and baggy clothes and feminist posters and decided that I was a repressed homosexual and coming out as gay would magically make me start eating again. Like I said, they were trying. There was only one problem. I wasnt gay. I was sure about that. I was bisexual, and I was very much hoping that one day when I wasnt quite so weird and sad Id be able to test the theory in practice. It took a long time to persuade the doctors of that. I cant remember how, and Im not sure I want to. I think diagrams may have been involved. It was a very dark time. Anyway. Eventually they gave up trying to make me come out and decided to make me go back in. If you werent a lesbian, the route to good mental health was to accept your femininity. You needed to grow your hair and wear dresses and stop being so angry all the time. You needed to accept the gender and sex you had been assigned, along with all the unspoken rules of behavior involved. You needed to get a steady boyfriend and smile nicely and work hard. I repeat: These people didnt mean to do me or anyone else lasting psychological damage. Just like every other institution through the centuries that has tried to force queer and deviant people to be normal for their own good, they truly were trying to help. For five years, I struggled to recover. I tried hard to be a good girl. I tried to stick to the dresses, the makeup, the not being quite so strange and cross and curious all the time. For five years, I shoved my queerness deep, deep down into a private, frightened place where it only emerged in exceptional circumstances, like a bottle of cheap vodka, or a showing of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, or both. But being a good girl didnt work out very well, so I cut the difference, cut my hair short, and went back to being an angry feminist. And feminism saved my life. I got better. I wrote, and I had adventures, and I returned to politics, and I made friends. I left the trauma of the hospital far behind me and tried to cover up my past with skirts and makeup. View this image  Today, Im a feminist and a writer, but I no longer valorize Germaine Greer so blindly. For one thing, Greer is one of many feminists, some of them well-respected, who believe transgender people are dangerous to the movement. Their argument is pretty simple. It boils down to the idea that trans people reinforce binary thinking about gender when they choose to join the other team instead of challenging what it means to be a man or a woman. Greer has called trans women a ghastly parody of femaleness. Greers comments about trans women exemplify the generational strife between second-wave feminists who sought to expand the definition of woman and the younger feminists who are looking for new gender categories altogether. This tension has been cruel to trans women, who have been cast as men trying to infiltrate womens spaces. But its alienating to all corners of the LGBT community. By the time I was well enough to consider swapping the skirts for cargo pants, changing my pronouns and the way I walked through the world, Id become well-known as, among other things, a feminist writer. At 24, I wrote columns about abortion rights and sexual liberation, and books about how to live and love under capitalist patriarchy. In response, young women wrote to me on a regular basis telling me that my work helped inspire them to live more freely in their femaleness. They admired me because I was a strong woman. Would I be betraying those girls if I admitted that half the time, I didnt feel like a woman at all? So I hoarded up my excuses for not coming out. I carefully described myself as a person with cis privilege rather than a cis person when the conversation came up. I decided that the daily emotional overheads of being a feminist writer on the internet were enough for now. And I waited. Over the past few years, more and more of my friends and comrades have come out as trans. Ive been privileged to be part of a strong and supportive queer community, and it has helped that a great many of my close friends are both trans and feminist. For them, there doesnt seem to be a problem with fighting for gender equality while fighting transphobia which sometimes, sadly, means that theyre also fighting feminists. Many of the critiques of trans politics from feminists through the decades have been openly bigoted, the sort of self-justifying theories that let people feel OK about driving other, more vulnerable people out of their jobs, outing them to their families and welfare advisers, and putting them in danger. Buried under the bullshit, though, are some reasonable critiques. One is that people who claim a trans identity are only doing so because gender roles are so restrictive and oppressive in the first place. Sadly, many trans people are forced to play into tired gender stereotypes in order to prove their identity to everyone from strangers to medical gatekeepers not long ago, one friend of mine was queried at a gender clinic because she showed up to her appointment in baggy jeans, which was evidence of her lack of commitment to life as a woman. I repeat: Even trousers are political. I regret that there wasnt more language, dialogue, and support for trans and genderqueer kids when I was a teenager and needed it most. I regret that by the time I had found that community and that language, I was too traumatized by hospital, by prejudice, and by the daily pressures of living and working in a frenzied, wearily misogynist media landscape to take advantage of the freedoms on offer. I regret the fear that kept me from coming out for so many years. When I say I regret those things, I mean that I try not to think about them too much, because the knowledge of how different things could have been if Id known as a teenager that I wasnt alone, the thought of how else I might have lived and loved and dated if Id had the words and the community I have now just a little sooner, opens cold fingers of longing somewhere in my stomach and squeezes tight. But when they let go, Im also glad. The journey I took as I came to terms with my own identity the journey that will continue as long as I live all of that has led me to where I am now. More than anything, Im excited. Im excited to see how life is going to be different for the queer, trans, and even cis kids too, growing up in a world that has more language for gender variance. Im excited to find out what sort of lives they will lead, from the genderqueer activists in the audience at my last reading to the barista with the orange mohawk who handed me the cup of tea Im clutching for dear life as I write alone in this caf, trying to believe that writing this piece is something other than gross self-indulgence. The barista is wearing two name badges. One says their name; the other one says, in thick chalk capitals, I am not a girl. My pronouns are They/Them. View this image  So here it is. I consider woman to be a made-up category, an intangible, constantly changing idea with as many different definitions as there are cultures on Earth. You could say the same thing about justice or money or democracy these are made-up ideas, stories we tell ourselves about the shape of our lives, and yet they are ideas with enormous real-world consequences. Saying that gender is fluid doesnt mean that we have to ignore sexism. In fact, its the opposite. Of course gender norms play into the trans experience. How can they not? But being trans or genderqueer, even for cis-passing people like me, is not about playing into those norms. Its about about throwing them out. Some radical feminists argue that trans and genderqueer people actually shore up the gender binary by seeking to cross or straddle it rather than setting it on fire. To which Id say: It is also possible to jump over a burning building. In fact, watch me. Only when we recognize that manhood and womanhood are made-up categories, invented to control human beings and violently imposed, can we truly understand the nature of sexism, of misogyny, of the way we are all worked over by gender in the end. Coming out is an individual journey, but it is a collective weapon. Questioning gender whether that means straddling the gender binary, crossing it, or breaking down its assumptions wherever you happen to stand is an essential part of the feminism that has sustained me through two decades of personal and political struggle. In the end, feminists and the LGBT community have this in common: Were all gender traitors. We have broken the rules of good behavior assigned to us at birth, and we have all suffered for it. But heres one big way I differ from a lot of my genderqueer friends: I still identify, politically, as a woman. My identity is more complex than simply female or male, but as long as womens reproductive freedom is under assault, sex is also a political category, and politically, Im still on the girls team. I dont think that everyone who was dumped into the female category at birth has a duty to identify as a woman, politically or otherwise. Because identity policing, if youll indulge me in a moment of high theoretical language, is fucked up and bullshit. This is just how it happens to work for me. In a perfect world, perhaps Id be telling a different story. Im never going to be able to say for sure whether in that perfect world, that world without sexism and gender oppression, that world without violence or abuse, where kittens dance on rainbows and nobody has ever heard of Donald Trump, I would feel the need to call myself genderqueer. My hunch is that I would; and all Ive got for you is that hunch, along with a stack of feminist theory books and a pretty nice collection of flat caps. I am a woman, politically, because thats how people see me and thats how the state treats me. And sometimes Im also a boy. Gender is something I perform, when I put on my binder or paint my nails. When I walk down the street. When I talk to my boss. When I kiss my partner in their makeup and high heels. I dont want to see a world without gender. I want to see a world where gender is not oppressive or enforced, where there are as many ways to express and perform and relate to your own identity as there are people on Earth. I want a world where gender is not painful, but joyful. But until then, weve got this one. And for as long as we all have to navigate a gender binary thats fundamentally broken and a sex class system that seeks to break us, Im happy to be a gender traitor. Im a genderqueer woman, and a feminist. My preferred pronouns are she or they. I believe were on our way to a better world. And you can call me Laurie. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Maybe this person wasnt the one-dimensional villain Id made him out to be. View this image  Pete Ryan for BuzzFeed News What does a gay man do when stuck in rural Oklahoma? In all my years as a lecherous homosexual, I have never, not even once, hooked up with someone in my hometown. The primary reason being: My hometown is miles away from anywhere an openly gay man would likely take up residence. Thats not to say I dont enjoy visiting home. I do. I enjoy getting away from D.C. I enjoy seeing the buffalo out at the wildlife refuge. I enjoy visiting my parents donkeys in the barn. I enjoy the wide-open skies, unobstructed by skyscrapers and billboards and smokestacks. But damn, its impossible to catch a dick out there. And so, whenever I find myself in my old room with its lovely view of the mountains and the miles upon miles of yellow grass we call the Great Plains, I am forced to find another outlet for my sexual energy one that doesnt involve actually meeting anyone. The best app for this, by far, is Scruff. Scruff is different from its notorious counterpart Grindr in a number of ways. For one, it feels more chill. You can woof at people you find attractive instead of messaging them, an appealing option for an introvert. But most importantly, unlike distance-based dating apps, you can talk to people from all over the world. In my neck of the woods, the nearest guy on Scruff, a self-described 53 y/o DTF white male, is located 13 miles away from me. He always, without fail, has as his default picture a horrifying photograph of a human head mounted on a wall with gazelle antlers sprouting from its skull. Not my type. Unwilling to become the next head on the white males wall, and too lazy to entertain the idea of driving thirty minutes to meet up with guys from the nearest city, I typically choose to spend my time on Scruff chatting up men from Brazil. Sometimes they teach me disgusting words in Portuguese (a service you wont find on Rosetta Stone). But the last time I went home, something strange happened. A blank profile messaged me from about a mile away. Given that this was during the dead of night, my first instinct was to open the blinds of my windows and check to see if I could spot a glowing light out in the field. A mile in rural Oklahoma is too close for comfort. It might as well be coming from inside the house. Hi, the message read. Curious, I responded. Whats up? A few minutes passed. I think you know me lol. Things were getting interesting. I flipped through my Rolodex of possibilities, but the only gay man I knew of who lived in the area was my best friend from high school, and he had philosophical differences with dating apps. With a rush of excitement, I deduced that this must be a teacher I once had. A specific one. I knew it, I thought. We went to school together, the blank profile continued. We did? I replied, on edge. Who are you? You probably dont like me haha. I was a little mean to you. A familiar feeling bubbled up in my gut: Panic. I knew which school he meant. There was only one for miles and miles around. It was my former middle school, the one where Id been mercilessly bullied for being gay.Even after Id left and after Id grown up a bit, I still couldnt drive through town or pass the school without having a visceral reaction. My hands would shake. My stomach would tie itself in knots. This was my body saying, Youre in danger. I didnt really have one bully. I had quite a few back then. And this guys blank dating profile provided didnt narrow it down much. I mentally rifled through names and faces. Who? I asked again. He sent a picture. I instantly recognized him. He wasnt one of my main bullies. That much was a relief. And yet, for one reason or another, despite being more or less a background character during the worst years of my life, his was one of the faces of my past I still clearly remembered. I still have nightmares about this person: nightmares where I am thirteen again, standing in the hallways of my tiny school out in the middle of nowhere. My mission in these nightmares is to avoid being seen, to hide behind locker doors until I make it to the safety of the bathroom. But I am always seen, and when I am, it feels like the monster caught me. I wake up sweating. I put my hand to my heart. I think it was the casual way he joined in on the harassment that made me hate him. The way after someone called me faggot he would parrot them, ally himself with them, use me to form solidarity with others. I came to see him as the embodiment of what had happened to me. He was everyone who didnt stop it. He was everyone who could have helped me. And so, I carried his voice with me for years. He doesnt know it, but hes had a major impact on my life. As I got older, I became impossible to argue with or criticize. Whenever someone tried to confront me, even in a respectful way, I would see his face again. I would hear his voice. I would feel ganged up on. I would become defensive. I would lash out. Dude, the other person might say. Relax. But it only made me angrier. I was angry all the time. How could I not be? If I ever let my guard down, someone would hurt me again. Day in and day out, I felt like a cornered animal. My body would scream, Attack. Attack. Attack. This is before I knew what fight-or-flight meant or what PTSD was. Before I knew those words, I knew him. Oh, I finally replied to his picture. Yeah. I remember you. After the panic subsided, embarrassment set in. I recalled, of all things, a tree outside my old apartment in Oklahoma City. It was warped and crazy-shaped. This was because, as my landlady explained to me, the tree had grown up and around something instead of straight up. The object, whatever it was, was later removed, resulting in the trees strange trajectory. That was me: A weird-ass tree that had grown up, around, and in spite of something, shaping myself to it even after that something had long gone. This experience had altered me. Changed me, in some irreversible way. Whatever. The metaphor worked in my head at the time. But how had I let that happen? How had I let him have such an influence on me? Are you mad? the profile asked. Yes, I said. Unable to control myself, I decided to ask him if he remembered anything hed done. No lol, he said. But I was a real asshole back then. And that was it. All those years of remembering, carrying, and suffering over this person, and he probably never thought about me at all after I moved away. A better, more appropriate tree-ism came to mind: The axe forgets; the tree remembers. I had to walk for a while. If rural Oklahoma is good for one thing, its long walks outside, especially in the fall when the night air is clean and crisp. I breathed into my hands to warm my nose as I crunched along the gravel road, trying to clear my head. I thought about it, and when I calmed down, I reached a conclusion I didnt expect. This person wasnt the one-dimensional villain Id made him out to be. All this time, hed been closeted. Just like me. Yes, he had hurt me. Yes, he was wrong to hurt me. But I realized he was a victim too. In the town he and I had grown up in, being gay was seen as one of the worst things you could be. You might as well not even be human. I was fortunate enough to have parents who accepted me. But I know he didnt. When he saw me getting pushed or getting my books smacked out of my hands or getting slurs thrown my way, he must have been relieved it wasnt him. And I cant forgive that. But I can understand it. He and I were both thrown into an environment where we had to either prove our masculinity or become a target. I can assume he felt scared. I can assume he was unhappy. I can assume he felt pain. I didnt know it at the time, but he and I were caught in the same system, a cycle of violence that perpetuates itself one that leaves in its wake people who are in turns the victim and the villain. Someone made him hate himself. He saw himself in me. And so, he hated me. If I could trace what happened to me back to its roots, it would be somewhere far beyond him and beyond me. Its the thing that makes me insecure about my voice. Its the thing that makes me stop and consider, whenever Im picking out clothes, whether the things I like are too feminine. Its the thing that makes me have to think critically about why I dislike certain things about myself and why I dislike those things in others. Masculinity has been programmed into me since before I can remember, but it has taken me a lifetime to unlearn. In fact, Im still unlearning. Im not free of internalized hatred either. Thats the brutal reality. But the process of unlearning it has given me more freedom than I ever imagined for myself. It has helped me separate the real me from the me Ive been told to be. Its made me more accepting of others and of myself. Thats something I want for everyone. Even people who have hurt me. I was busy thinking all these thoughts when I received another message on my phone. Want to fool around? he asked. I didnt know how to tell him that this was a nightmare I hadnt even considered. It would probably take weeks to scrub that image from my mind, the thought of fooling around with someone who had traumatized me. No, I said. Have a good life, man. I meant it.

aS"I wasnt dressing up as a celebrity or a historical figure, but rather as an everyday girl. I was presenting as myself. View this image  Angie Wang for BuzzFeed News You look so good as a girl, my friend Lucy said after I borrowed one of her skin-tight black mini-dresses for Halloween. I hate you. I looked in her full-length mirror as she pointed out how thin my legs were, and how I had delicate features that only got prettier as she helped me apply lipstick and mascara. View this image  Me in 2000. Meredith Talusan That was the first night I dressed in drag or, what I thought was drag at the time for our annual Halloween Drag Night at Adams House, my undergrad dorm at Harvard. Drag was never something I particularly craved, especially since I incorporated feminine clothes into my wardrobe on a regular basis, but more in the vein of colorful tops and scarves rather than dresses. When I came into our dining hall and found most of the other people dressed across gender, the comments about how convincing I was continued. While there were certainly attractive drag queens among our young group, there was something about my average build that didnt turn me into a larger-than-life theatrical version of femininity, but just someone who belonged with the women. View this image  Me now. Meredith Talusan It wasnt until I began to transition, six years later, that I came to understand what those early experiences meant to me. I kept coming back to that moment when Lucy told me I looked amazing in her dress, when other friends told me I occupied womanhood so well, those three different times in college when I borrowed dresses for Halloween. This sense of affirmation carried me through the toughest times when I lost friends and was discriminated against because Im trans. Since Halloween is the one day of the year when those assigned male are allowed to dress as women in public, Ive known for a while that it has a significant place in the lives of many trans women and non-binary femmes. But what I didnt realize, until I actually asked some friends what Halloween meant to them, was that there are huge differences in how Halloween has affected our lives. Here are some of their perspectives. View this image  Sarah now. Sarah McBride For the first 21 years of my life, Halloween meant the opportunity for the costume to come off. I guess my relationship with Halloween was the exact opposite of my cisgender friends. For 364 days I wore a costume, but Halloween was the one day a year where it was remotely acceptable to explore my gender expression and identity. The Halloweens where I mustered up the courage to explore my gender resulted in the most boring costumes possible. I wasnt dressing up as a celebrity or a historical figure, but rather as an everyday girl. I was presenting as myself. The beginning of the end of my time in the closet was Halloween 2011. I was serving as student body president at American University and decided, along with two guy friends of mine, to go as girls. And so I went out as me. View this image  Sarah in 2011. Sarah McBride I remember feeling so free when the first pictures of me as a girl went up on my Facebook that night. Almost immediately the responses were life-affirming. It was that night where I first realized, Okay, I can do this. I can transition. I can make it. Almost no one knew they were seeing me for the first time. Two months later I came out to my parents and started to transition. My journey would have been dramatically different had it not been for that one night a year where it was socially acceptable for a straight, cis guy to push the gender barriers. Halloween gave me the room necessary to explore without as much fear.  View this image  Benjamin in 2005. Benjamin Mintzer The significance of Halloween for me boils down to this picture my mom took of me when I was 16. At the time, I wasnt even aware that transgender people exist, even though people had been identifying me as a girl since I was a kid. My family always corrected those people who took me for a girl, and that was how I internalized that being a girl was something I shouldnt be. But that one Halloween night was the exception, when I dressed up as a girl for a high school party. I was incredibly anxious leading up to the moment. I spent about a month planning: window shopping for the perfect dress, befriending the makeup counter beauticians at the mall, and budgeting my meager teenage finances. That Halloween gave me permission, in the conservative political climate of the suburbs, to subvert the identity assigned to me. Being welcomed by my friends, and even hit on by straight male peers, made my identity feel legitimate and accepted, even for one night. My mother took this picture when I came home from the party. I havent felt closer to her since. And sadly, I dont think I ever will again, because of how hard it is for her to accept my gender-nonconformity. View this image  Jasmine now. Jasmine Rodriguez View this image  Jasmine in 2006. Jasmine Rodriguez On Halloween 2004, ten days shy of my eighteenth birthday, I dressed in drag really bad Wal-Mart last minute costume drag. Then I met up with two girls from work just to hang out in the park. This was in Tampa, and ignorant of the dangers awaiting a lonely boy in drag in that particular neck of the woods, I walked home. As I neared the entrance to the subdivision where I lived, a red pickup sped past, a beer bottle whizzing past my head and landing in the grass. I stayed as calm as I could, walked all the way home, and didnt say a word about it. 2006 was the year I began transition. On Halloween, I got dressed up for a nightclub, and my friends and I got plastered. I dont remember it at all so it must have been great (I hope). After that, I used Halloween as a way to play into the sexy costume ideas, one year as Catwoman in something Im too shy to wear now. Lately, Ive begun to have less time for Halloween because of work. Now, for the first time in a few years Im off for Halloween, and Im going as a nudist on strike because the holiday that once held so much significance for me just before and during my early transition has somehow snuck up on me. I suppose now that I no longer feel as though have only one day of the year to be free, it has lost its appeal beyond staying in and watching movies. I transitioned in my teens and am not public about being trans, or stealth as people call it. I feel a little weird that Ive never cross-dressed on Halloween, either before or after transition. It was one of those trans woman checkboxes I never went through. I was constantly worried about people seeing a man in drag or just a guy in a guys costume. Halloween is the patron holiday of drag queens already, so even though young trans women also use it as a time to dress up, I feel like going out in highly-gendered costume is putting yourself on blast. Think of when cisgender people wear cross-gendered costumes: its the exact opposite of passing. Its parody. Short of being read as trans while being out on a date and dressed up, nothing else sucks more. View this image  Christopher Soto The first time I wore a dress in public, I was nervous. I performed femme as a character, flipping my hair, popping my ass, strutting my walk. The first time I wore a dress, femme became a comedy, a character, a joke to perform. I was scared of being seen. Femme was not a presence to inhabit, because it was something to be ashamed of. Now, I am thinking about the transphobia that cis-men reproduce when wearing dresses on Halloween, the way that trans people (and cis women) become characters to mimic (like zombies and ghouls and mermaids). Trans femme existence is only possible when it is a costume. I am thinking about how that site of violence also becomes my one day for liberation. Nobody will look at me and say WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT DUDE DOING IN A DRESS? They wont know that Im not in costume. View this image  Hannah now. Hannah Simpson View this image  Hannah in 2011 Hannah Simpson For me, Halloween was Plausible Deniability Day. It was the one time I could dress as a girl and it was okay. The first time was in college and I had bought heels at a thrift shop and a dress I hoped might fit. I went to marching band rehearsal in my costume, but nobody else was even wearing a costume. Everyone else had theirs packed to take out later at the party. I guess I was too excited. A few years later I came fully dressed to work at a campus lab on Halloween Day. Nothing flamboyant. nstead, I dressed as if I had always been female, picking a work-appropriate skirt and boots. A few coworkers knew my truth, but my bosses didnt. Half the thought it was funny as hell, the rest found it tremendously unprofessional. For me, it just felt natural, and I knew nobody dared to raise a huge stink. With each year I got more confident going out in public and posting pictures via Facebook. I felt if I lessened the shock itd be easier and safer. If people did question me, Id be able to turn the tables and ask them why they hadnt known my open secret all along. Halloween was a gateway. It was the chance I could wear womens clothes as a costume, even during the day, when nobody else was wearing their costume yet. In reality, I wasnt either. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS'The World Congress of Families closes today amid debate how to continue to oppose same-sex marriage without being anti-LGBT. Ten years ago people could say, The homosexual movement is coming for America, and now you cant, one leader told BuzzFeed News. View this image  People look on during the World Congress of Families. Rick Bowmer / AP SALT LAKE CITY When the father of Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz said Wednesday that the next thing [LGBT activists] are going to push [is] to try to legalize pedophiles, the idea wasnt new to the organization that was hosting him. Rafael Cruz, an evangelical pastor, made the remark following a panel at a conference that drew more than 3,000 people from around the world to Salt Lake City called the World Congress of Families. Since the event first grew out of a wonky conversation between American and Russian academics in 1995, it has grown into an event bringing together social conservative activists from every continent and a top target of groups like the Human Rights Campaign (HRC). Many associated with the organization have raised the specter of pedophilia as part of making the case against greater social and legal acceptance for homosexuality over its 20-year history. That same morning, for example, WCF gave an award to Andrea Minichiello Williams of the British group Christian Concern, who said in a 2013 speech to Jamaican activists fighting repeal of the countrys sodomy law that LGBT advocates hate the line of homosexuality being linked to pedophilia. They try to cut that off, so you cant speak about it. So I say to you in Jamaica: Speak about it. View this image  World Congress of Families Executive Director Janice Crouse. Rick Bowmer / AP So even some of the WCFs participants were surprised when the conferences lead organizer, Janice Shaw Crouse, issued a statement saying that Cruzs views are not those of the World Congress of Families, which advocates for life and the natural family in a civil, constructive and transparent way. The episode is a sign of growing pains for an organization that still partly sees itself as a rag-tag academic conference at a time when major geopolitical disputes are being fought over LGBT rights. It invited deeper scrutiny from its fiercest critics by bringing the event to the United States, where the media and political context has changed so fast that arguments against homosexuality that were once largely uncontroversial among its participants now threaten the civil, constructive image its organizers have tried to project. Navigating this terrain is even more complicated because so many of its participants work in countries that have grown more hostile to LGBT rights at the same time so much of the Americas and Europe have embraced marriage equality. This has some of the groups key players wondering if the new reality demands a new approach. Were no longer under the radar were actually smack dab in the middle of a whole bunch of radars, said the organizations co-founder and long-time director Allan Carlson, who recently retired. At some point when youre being watched closely you have to reign it in. The World Congress of Families emerged on a frigid night in early 1995 in a modest apartment in Moscow, according to Carlson, a walrusy academic with a bushy mustache and whose speaking style brings to mind a professor whose lectures college students sleep through. When he teamed up with a handful of Russian sociologists to plan the first World Congress of Families, held in Prague in 1997, it wasnt conceived of as a permanent organization. And in reality, it still isnt much of one today. It maintains only a handful of part-time staff in between its biannual conferences. Theyre operate under the auspices of something called the Howard Center for Family, Religion, and Society in Rockford, Illinois, which primarily publishes papers to promote the natural family. But it casts a big shadow because its conferences, have become an important vector for connecting social conservatives from every continent who work on issues ranging from banning abortion to combatting sex-trafficking to morality education for children. Smaller progressive groups like People for the American Way, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and Political Research Associates have been trying to publicize the anti-LGBT work of WCF affiliates for several years, but its only in the past two years that its become a major target of the U.S. LGBT movement. Thats thanks in part to a change in the landscape on the left: In 2013, the Human Rights Campaign began turning its formidable media and fundraising machine to international work for the first time. Many of the WFCs American partner organizations were long-time opponents of HRC at home, making it an ideal early target as the group figured out what its international operation would actually do. This was made easier by the fact that a WCF conference was planned to be held in 2014 inside the Kremlin in Moscow and its organizers repeatedly defended the countrys homosexual propaganda ban in events promoting the conference in the U.S. This was around the time of the Sochi Olympics and the showdown over the Russian law thrust questions about LGBT rights into the heart of geopolitics. (After an American WCF sponsor withdrew from the event after Russia invaded Ukraine WCF reluctantly removed its official imprimatur from the event, which was still held in September under a different name.) WCF is perhaps kind of global brand more than an organization, an entity that allows a wide variety of activists to fly under its flag but has nothing approaching a clear governing body. It partners with some of the worlds most established social conservative organizations like the Family Research Council and the National Organization for Marriage and confers honors on activists in places with less mature pro-family movements in order to raise their stature at home and abroad. This also gives the World Congress of Families the appearance of direct influence on conservative victories abroad like passage of Russias homosexual propaganda ban in 2012 or the 2014 anti-LGBT law in Nigeria where foreigners have played only a peripheral role. This is a loose confederation but the WCF never endorses all the views of any particular individual or organization, said the groups interim director E. Douglas Clark in an interview with BuzzFeed News. He said Cruzs remarks linking homosexuality and pedophilia offends my sensibilities. As a whole, he said, the group isnt anti anybody; it is pro: We are for the family as the natural fundamental unit of society. And there were several harsh comments made about transgender people, frequently at the expense of Caitlyn Jenner, whose name brought boos from the audience. Sex reassignment is a mass delusion that is destructive and dangerous, said Miriam Grossman, whose website bills her as 100 percent MD, 0 percent PC. We are fighting a war. Hard science is a weapon of mass destruction. Lets use it. A sign of the pressure the group feels it is under is that the Questions and Answers section of the conferences website is actually a lengthy rebuttal to an HRC document that calls the WCF one of the most influential American organizations involved in the export of hate. WCFs response states that these activist organizations are taking statements out of context and extrapolating conclusions, as well as attempting to hold WCF accountable for pronouncements made by individuals who have no official relationship with the organization. Brian Brown of the National Organization for Marriage, one of the sponsors of this years event, said it was unfair for LGBT groups to demand that groups like his repudiate positions of its international allies. These questions will continue to confront NOM, which on Monday held the latest in a series of meetings over the past three years to explore the creation of an International Organization for Marriage, according to multiple people invited to attend. Though Brown and other organizers of the conference say they oppose laws that criminalize homosexuality, the WCF named as 2015s Woman of the Year, Theresa Okafor, a Nigerian activist who supported a 2014 Anti-Same Sex Marriage Law that went far beyond defining marriage as a man as a woman. With sentences up to 14 years, it also criminalizes promoting LGBT rights or even public displays of affection. When asked whether that was a conflict for NOM, Brown said, I dont understand why theres any problem One can oppose [extended prison sentences for homosexual acts] and still work with folks around the world who agree on the issue of marriage. But to the WCFs critics, this posture simply allows the group to distance itself when some of their affiliates work or comments play badly in U.S. or European media. Thats the issue with the World Congress: They will never take responsibility for the havoc and damage their participants do all over the world, said Troy Williams of the LGBT rights group Equality Utah, an organizer of events that countered the WCF program in Salt Lake City. You cant invite a rabid homophobe like Rafael Cruz to the stage and claim that youre not responsible for the things that theyve said. The case of Andrea Minichiello Williams the WCF awardee who urged Jamaicans to speak about a link between homosexuality and pedophilia in 2013 does give the appearance that the group sanctions saying different things to different audiences. When asked for comment for this story, Williams said in a phone call that BuzzFeed News had misquoted and distorted her remarks in Jamaica when it first reported them. After BuzzFeed News provided her with a recording of her comments, she sent a comment by email, I am at the World Congress of Families to push back against the elitist sexual agenda and celebrate the beauty and hope that is found in the natural family as defined in the bible and by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We have heard repeated, undeniable evidence of how children do best when raised by their mother and father. w.soundcloud.com It comes as no surprise that the veneer broke and the true anti-LGBT animus thats lurking right below the surface was exposed for all to see, said Kerry Brody of the Human Rights Campaign on Wednesday afternoon. The World Congress of Families has tried very hard this week to hide its and its affiliates positions, actions, and advocacy behind a wall of sunshine-and-rainbows sounding rhetoric These arent examples of one of two people going off message. Theyre saying what they think is true, and are spewing vitriol and venom to a cheering crowd who likely agrees with them. View this image  People applaud during the World Congress of Families. Rick Bowmer / AP At the same time WCF has been hammered by groups like the Human Rights Campaign in the months surrounding the event, it also is getting criticized on the right by activists who claim that it is sacrificing principle in its efforts to be seen as pro-natural family rather than anti-LGBT. This charge was laid bare in an 11-hour conference held in Salt Lake City just before WCF kicked off, titled, Understanding Homosexuality The Politically Incorrect Truth, organized by the anti-LGBT group MassResistance. Its organizers billed it as possibly the most powerful conference to date dealing with the radical LGBT agenda, and included Mat Staver of Liberty Counsel, the lawyer for the Kentucky clerk jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, Kim Davis. I think there is a place for being insulting and degrading, and I think I can back that up by scripture, said MassResistances director, Brian Camenker, in a video posted online by People for the American Way. I think we have to look at this as a war, not as, you know, a church service. Camenker, who is Jewish, said later in the program that scripture lays out a separate set of rules for people who want to tear down the moral structure of society, asserting that God says those people who want to do that must be destroyed. (Camenker declined a BuzzFeed News request for an interview.) It appeared what Camenkers group described as shameful cowardice had invaded even his own conference he made his remarks after other speakers, including some activists who were also appearing at the WCF, had argued that their work against homosexuality was motivated by love rather than hate. (This includes Peter Sprigg of the Family Research Council, author of a 2010 pamphlet that asserts gay men are disproportionately likely to be child molesters. He also declined an interview request.) This tension is a sign of a real strategic disagreement among advocates who oppose LGBT rights about how to continue their work in an era where comments that can be construed as homophobic provoke a media storm, said Austin Ruse of C-Fam, also known as the Center for Family & Human Rights, who was on the organizing committee for the Salt Lake City conference. One of the leitmotifs in the planning for this [was] not wanting to be overt about criticizing homosexuality per se, said Ruse, who sent an email about the conference to his groups supporters on Thursday in which he said, One of the more monstrous lies of our time is that same-sex desire is normal and natural. View this image  M. Russell Ballard, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, speaks during the World Congress of Families Rick Bowmer / AP This is an especially delicate question given that the conference is being held in Salt Lake City, the seat of the Mormon Church, which worked with LGBT activists to get a bill known as the Utah Compromise and aimed at barring discrimination in housing and employment through Utahs Republican legislature. The bill had substantial exceptions that Mormon leaders said were necessary to protect religious liberty, and it was criticized by both religious conservatives and LGBT activists. But the dtente between LGBT activists and Mormon leaders was still remarkable, especially since so much ill will had formed among LGBT people for the church because of its support in 2008 for Californias Proposition 8, which blocked same-sex marriage there until courts struck it down. One of the most controversial speeches inside the conference was arguably its opening keynote, delivered by Mormon Elder M. Russell Ballard, who used his remarks to highlight the Utah compromise. We can love one another without compromising personal divine ideas, he said. We can speak about those ideals without marginalizing others. Ballard concluded his remarks by calling upon responsible citizens and officers of government everywhere to promote these measures designed to maintain and strengthen the family as the fundamental unit of society, and he got enthusiastic applause, but the principle of the Utah compromise was rejected out of hand by many of the WCFs key players. C-Fams Ruse voiced the sentiments of many in an interview with BuzzFeed News. The Mormons think that they can sign a treaty of nonaggression with the LGBTs, and I just think its lunacy, Ruse said. This conference is more careful than most previous years events have been, Ruse said, because the context has shifted so much. Ten years ago people could say, The homosexual movement is coming for America, and now you cant, Ruse said. Some in the movement now count it as a great victory when one of our opponents dont see us as evil, paraphrasing comments by an anti-same-sex marriage activist. But, Ruse said, A lot of us think thats not a victory at all. CORRECTION Austin Ruse works for C-Fam, which is also known as the Center for Family & Human Rights. A previous version of this story misstated the organizations name.

aS"The changes come after activists criticized the company in an open letter. Facebook today announced a couple of process improvements meant to smooth the road for those unfairly removed from its service due to its real names policy. The changes are designed to give people caught up in the policy more room to provide context, and will also now require more information from anyone reporting violations. The policy, which requires people to go by their authentic name on Facebook, has been heavily criticized, largely by members of the trans community as well as advocates who find it dangerous to use their real names in their work. We want to reduce the number of people who are asked to verify their name on Facebook, when they are already using the name people know them by, wrote Facebook VP of Growth Alex Schultz in a letter the company released today. We want to make it easier for people to confirm their name if necessary, he added. To that end, those required to confirm their name to Facebook will now have the ability to add context and details to the cases they make to the company. They were previously unable to do so. This should help our Community Operations team better understand the situation, said Schultz. It will also help us better understand the reasons why people cant currently confirm their name, informing potential changes we make in the future. The second big change is a new requirement forcing Facebook users who flag others under the policy to provide the company with more information about why they are reporting the profile. The change should add more friction to the reporting process, potentially lessening the likelihood it will be used as a weapon, locking certain people out of their profiles via the name-proving process. The changes are expected to start rolling out in December. Despite the introduction of these changes, Facebook is not backing away from the policy, which Schultz argued is making Facebook a safer place. When people use the name others know them by, they are more accountable for what they say, making it more difficult to hide behind an anonymous name to harass, bully, spam or scam someone else, he said. Schultzs letter comes in response to an open letter sent to Facebook by a number of groups including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Human Rights Watch, and ACLU of California calling Facebooks policy broken and demanding it be fixed. Facebook maintains a system that disregards the circumstances of users in countries with low levels of internet penetration, exposes its users to danger, disrespects the identities of its users, and curtails free speech, the letter said. Once someone gets shut out of Facebook for violating the real-names policy, the process of confirming an authentic name can be arduous and frustrating. Given that, any process improvement will likely be welcome, though its difficult to say if it will smooth out the edges enough to make the policy work for everyone.

aS"Talking to people about the Defense of Marriage Act today in a political climate that is much more supportive of LGBT rights is very different than examining what those people actually wrote and discussed in 1996. View this image  BuzzFeed News; Getty images (2) WASHINGTON Over the past few years, some Democrats including the Clintons have offered a new explanation for why they supported the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996. The threat of a federal constitutional amendment, these Democrats have argued, motivated them to support DOMA a law that defined marriage for federal government purposes as between one man and one woman and said states could refuse to recognize same-sex couples marriages from others states. We were attempting at the time, in a very reactionary Congress, Bill Clinton told an audience in 2009, to head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states. Four former senators including Tom Daschle, who made the claim in 2011 raised the idea in a Supreme Court brief in 2013. Clinton later cited that brief when, in a Washington Post op-ed, he called for the law he signed to be struck down by the court. Hillary Clinton just last week called her husbands decision to sign DOMA a defensive action. There is no contemporaneous evidence, however, to support the claim that the Clinton White House considered a possible federal constitutional amendment to be a concern, based on a BuzzFeed News review of the thousands of documents released earlier this year by the Clinton Presidential Library about same-sex couples marriage rights and the Defense of Marriage Act. In the documents, which include correspondence from a wide array of White House and Justice Department officials, no one even hints that Bill Clintons thinking or actions regarding DOMA were animated by the threat of a federal constitutional amendment. View this image  Former President Bill Clinton and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton in Iowa, Saturday, Oct. 24, 2015. Charlie Neibergall / AP Photo The claim has faced renewed scrutiny in recent days after Hillary Clinton made an extended argument in an interview with MSNBCs Rachel Maddow that DOMA was a line to be drawn to prevent further action. I think what my husband believed and there was certainly evidence to support it is that there was enough political momentum to amend the Constitution of the United States of America, and that there had to be some way to stop that, she told Maddow. I was in on some of those discussions, on both dont ask, dont tell and on DOMA, where both the president, his advisers, and occasionally I would chime in and talk about, You cant be serious, you cant be serious. But they were, Hillary Clinton said. And so, in a lot of ways, DOMA was a line that was drawn, that was to prevent going further. Maddow pressed here, asking, It was a defensive action? It was a defensive action, she replied. In the days since, many longtime LGBT advocates have called the comments inaccurate and her leading opponent for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders, who voted against the legislation as a congressman, criticized her implicitly but sharply, onstage at the Jefferson-Jackson Dinner in Iowa. By Monday afternoon, Hillary Clinton spokesperson Brian Fallon had pulled back a bit, telling the Huffington Post, Whatever the context that led to the passage of DOMA nearly two decades ago, Hillary Clinton believes the law was discriminatory and both she and president Clinton urged that it be overturned. He did not, however, say whether Clinton stood by her comments and her version of history. At her husbands presidential library in Little Rock, Arkansas, however, the history is clear. There was no documented discussion in 1996 within the White House or Justice Department about any momentum for a federal constitutional amendment that DOMA was intended to prevent. For the most part, White House staffers assumed Clinton would eventually support DOMA once the bills introduction was certain. Bill Clinton had already stated his opposition to same-sex couples marriage rights. In 1996, Clinton repeatedly marked his approval of talking points on same-sex marriage, as it is referred to in the documents and will be referred to throughout this report, and DOMA; the talking points included his opposition to same-sex marriage and opposition to providing federal benefits to same-sex couples. While some of the few out gay employees and their strongest straight allies worked in the spring of the year to find a way to keep Clinton from supporting DOMA, the internal conversation surrounding the bill mostly concerned when Clinton would announce his support. And Clinton ended up announcing his support sooner rather than later. On May 23, 1996 less than three weeks after the bill was introduced in Congress Clinton announced that he would sign the bill if it came to him as he understood it. Through it all, though, no one discussing the bill in the Clinton administration from the White House senior staff to gay staffers and their strongest allies to the press office to Justice Department lawyers ever mentioned any concern about a federal constitutional amendment.  During his 1992 presidential campaign, Bill Clinton had said he opposed same-sex marriage. Still, by the beginning of 1996, there was optimism inside the White House about how Clinton would treat same-sex couples during his re-election bid. On Feb. 1, 1996, a law clerk in the White House Counsels Office wrote a memo about the same-sex marriage question, at the request of her superior. Although no state would legalize marriage equality until 2004, the treatment of same-sex couples and in particular the landmark marriage case in Hawaii had begun to force consideration of the issue. So in the winter of 1996, associate counsel Marvin Krislov asked the law clerk, Chrysanthe Gussis, to do some research and draft a tentative statement on the issue. The administration believes that the legal status of same-sex unions, and the accompanying rights and benefits, should continue to be determined on the state and local level, Gussis wrote in the draft statement. In an optional section, she added: The lack of legally recognized alternatives to marriage and the exclusion of gay and lesbian relationships from marriage have left many couples unable to define their relationships as they choose, and often has led to disparate and unfair treatment of similarly situated couples. In other words, in January 1996, a law clerk in the White House Counsels Office strongly implied that differing treatment of same-sex couples likely violated the Constitutions guarantee of equal protection of the laws. And, perhaps, as Gussis put it, states should give serious consideration to same-sex unions. By late March, however, the internal discussion had become more defensive. Marsha Scott, a straight woman who Clinton had named as his first gay and lesbian liaison, convened a meeting of gay and gay-supportive Clinton administration officials and Capitol Hill staffers. View this image  Via assets.documentcloud.org In the two weeks that followed, the group and others debated how the president should express his 1996 position on marriage. White House senior staff eventually settled on three bullet points, and Jack Quinn, the presidents counsel, provided them to Clinton on April 8 noting that Scott gave input and that George Stephanopoulos had approved them. The institutions of traditional marriage and family face tremendous pressures in todays society. We must do everything we can to support and strengthen these institutions. The president has previously said that he does not personally support same-sex marriages, the first bullet point read. The second noted that many communities and institutions were considering whether to offer certain basic benefits outside the context of traditional marriage. Even those protections, however, face the challenge of remain[ing] sensitive to the traditional values of communities while preserving the fundamental right to live free from unjustified discrimination. The final talking point noted that the country has looked first to state and local governments, as well as the private sector, to consider issues like these. It concluded, The president believes that these issues continue to be best resolved at this level of civil discourse. A stamp confirms Clinton saw the GAY MARRIAGE talking points document and the reverse checkmark that staffers say he used confirms his agreement with the three points. View this image   Over the course of the next month, the hypothetical language in the talking points was put to the test as Rep. Bob Barr introduced the Defense of Marriage Act on May, 7, 1996. Even then, though, nothing in the voluminous communications among members of the White House staff or between the Justice Department and White House mention any concerns about or even consideration of the possibility of a federal constitutional amendment that might explain support for DOMA. View this image  President Bill Clinton, Feb. 23, 1996. Nick Ut / AP Photo The story detailed in the discussions is simpler: Clinton opposed same-sex marriage and opposed federal recognition of same-sex couples marriages. Ultimately, then, he supported the substance of the bill and efforts to get him to oppose the bill on federalism grounds or due to constitutional concerns were shut down within a week of the bills introduction. DOMA had two substantive parts after its title section. Section 2 purported to give states the right to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages authorized by other states or jurisdictions, and Section 3 defined marriage for all federal government purposes as only being between one man and one woman. The White House, which had already been deciding how to handle the same-sex marriage question from a legal and messaging perspective, now also began preparing for DOMA. Harold Ickes, Clintons deputy chief of staff, and Stephanopoulos had previously asked the Justice Department whether the Constitution would require states to recognize same-sex couples marriages if Hawaii ended up allowing such marriages. On May 1, Quinn reported back that the Justice Department had concluded that states would not need to recognize such marriages. On May 9, Quinn alerted Leon Panetta, Clintons chief of staff; Stephanopoulos; and Mike McCurry, the presidents press secretary, that DOMA had been introduced in the House. They advised that, if asked about the bill, Clinton should say that he had not yet had an opportunity to review the legislation. Meanwhile, Scott and Richard Socarides, who was in the process of taking over from Scott as gay and lesbian liaison, were trying to come up with ways for Clinton to take a position against the bill. In May 9 memos, Scott sent Stephanopoulos and others language provided by Socarides as a potential administration position on the bill. Arguing that Congress has more important things to do, Socarides suggested the White House should express concern about legislat[ing] in quintessential state issues and that its position should be: The institutions of traditional marriage and family face tremendous pressures in todays society. The president believes that we must do everything we can to support these institutions, but this particular legislation does not seem to advance that goal. She also followed up with additional thoughts of her own. The next day, Scott and Socarides sent a two-page memo to Ickes, arguing forcefully that Clinton should not back the bill because it would cause a serious rift with, as they put it, our friends in the gay community. [O]ur support of this bill would be taken by many in the gay communities as an expression by the president of deep ceded [sic] bias against gay people, they wrote, urging Clinton to oppose the bill as an unwarranted intrusion on states role in defining marriage or, if not that, at least say that he is withholding judgment while the Justice Department is studying the serious constitutional issues raised by the legislation. At the same time, however, the Justice Department recommended that Clinton back the bill. In a two-page memo, Associate Attorney General John Schmidt wrote that it would be difficult to explain how opposition to DOMA was compatible with opposition to same-sex marriage. Given the presidents opposition to same sex marriage, Schmidt wrote, it would seem to me to make sense to make clear as quickly as possible that, in light of that opposition, he supports enactment of the proposed statute. The senior staff took Schmidts advice. In a memo dated May 10, Quinn, Stephanopoulos, and Scott wrote to Clinton that there would not be a substantive basis for him to oppose DOMA and recommended that he sign this legislation if it is enacted. They also, however, wrote that the the White House could reiterate Clintons stated opposition to same-sex marriage but add that there has not yet been an opportunity to review this legislation a nod toward Scott and Socaridess last-ditch recommendation. Only [i]f and when this approach is no longer viable, they recommended, should the White House state that Clinton would sign the bill. The document bearing the reverse checkmark is noted as not having been seen by Clinton until May 14. As with the prior talking points memo reviewed by the president, the memo contained no mention of any concern about a federal constitutional amendment as a reason to support the legislation. While that memo was sitting on Clintons desk, McCurry, the press secretary, struck the first blow to the viability of the wait-and-see approach. At the press briefing on May 13, McCurry responded to a question by saying that Clinton opposed same-sex marriage. Asked why, McCurry said, He believes this is a time when we need to do things to strengthen the American family. The comment caused a stir, outside and inside the White House. In later communications, staffers argued that McCurry went beyond the April talking points in his comment by directly connecting Clintons opposition to same-sex marriage to his desire to strengthen the traditional family. In the talking points, the sentiments were in separate sentences in the same bullet point. McCurry, however, walked the comments back the next day, saying that Clinton opposed same-sex marriage but that McCurry had not gone deeper into the moral philosophy behind it with Clinton. Over the next few days, a second event made the wait-and-see approach exceptionally difficult to maintain. In a letter from the Justice Department, Assistant Attorney General Andrew Fois informed Rep. Henry Hyde, the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, The Department of Justice believes that [DOMA] would be sustained as constitutional, and that there are no legal issues raised by [DOMA] that necessitate an appearance by a representative of the Department. Although the letter was dated May 13, it was not made public until the morning of the first House hearing on DOMA two days later to the disappointment and consternation of Democratic opponents of DOMA on the Hill and LGBT advocates fighting the bill. White House officials have previously maintained that the White House was caught off guard by the letter. But one document found in the Clinton library files proves that, at the least, the White House Counsels Office was kept informed about drafting of the letter. Walter Dellinger a senior lawyer in the Justice Department who had previously worked in the Counsels Office sent a memo to Quinn on May 14, noting that the Justice Department had prepared a new version of the Defense of Marriage letter, taking out reference, Dellinger wrote, to Clintons opposition to same-sex marriage. View this image  Via assets.documentcloud.org As the Justice Department letter was being finalized and sent to the Hill, a new set of White House talking points emerged after some internal debate and after approval by Clinton. The talking points, while not declaring outright support for DOMA, left little question about where the president stood. They were faxed from Stephanopoulos to Scott and White House legislative affairs staffer Peter Jacoby on May 14 the day before the congressional hearing. As with the prior two documents reviewed by Clinton, there was no reference to any concern about a federal constitutional amendment. The president has long opposed gay marriage, the first bullet point noted. The second stated that Clinton strongly believes that gay and lesbian individuals should not be subject to unfair discrimination, but added that he does not believe that the federal government should promote gay marriages. In case those two points left any doubt, a third point was added for if someone was asked about domestic partnerships or providing federal benefits. Starting out by repeating prior statements about the decisions being best left to state and local governments and private institutions, the May 14 talking points added a comment that appears to be nothing less than unambiguous support for Section 3 of DOMA: [S]ince the president does not believe that the federal government should recognize gay marriage, he does not believe it is appropriate for federal resources to be devoted to providing spousal benefits to partners in gay and lesbian relationships. The Justice Department letter was made public on May 15 the first step toward the administrations endorsement of DOMA and staffers were going around with new talking points that effectively endorsed both provisions of the bill. Nonetheless, Scott and Socarides attempted to downplay the meaning of the Justice Departments letter, urging that, if asked, McCurry should say, This was a routine letter sent in response to a routine request for testimony. You should check with the Justice Department for further information on this decision. The claim was a bit disingenuous, given the new talking points and the fact that Scott had sent the memo to Clinton the previous week recommending that Clinton sign the legislation if passed by Congress. As Socarides and Scott were trying to control the public fallout from the Justice Department letter, however, Scott was preparing a path to break the news to Clintons gay and lesbian appointees that he would be supporting the legislation if passed. In a memo to Vice President Gore, who was due to host a historic gathering of out gay and lesbian appointees in the administration, Scott laid out the DOMA situation including McCurrys comments and Foiss letter and the senior staff recommendation that Clinton sign DOMA if passed. She then gave him his task. You must address this issue with the appointees, Scott wrote, noting, You have great respect within the gay and lesbian communities. The president is being identified with the problem. You are not. It would be another week before President Clinton addressed the bill publicly, but the outcome was set and there had been no mention, by anyone discussing the matter with the White House staff working on the bill, of concern that, without DOMA, there was momentum for a federal constitutional amendment.  The only question left was how long it would be before the White House, or Clinton himself, announced that he would sign the bill. It turned out, not long at all. On May 20, Scott was still optimistic, writing to Janice Enright, the special assistant to Ickes, that Ickes promised to put together a meeting to discuss the next step on this same-sex marriage issue. Noting that Gore had a trip to New York City in the coming days and Clinton had a bill-signing of the Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 1996 later that day, Scott wrote, Someone will ask. Everybody better be ready. The day after the bill-signing, Jeffrey Levi, the deputy director of the Office of National AIDS Policy, sent around talking points about DOMA and same-sex marriage that Scott reviewed talking points NOT cleared by Harold Ickes but that Eric Fanning, then a staffer in Ickess office, said reflected everything they have been saying. Among the points was one that [t]he president has not taken a formal position on the legislation now pending in Congress and he is unlikely to do so unless and until it comes to his desk. Less than 24 hours later, though, that talking point met its end. McCurry told reporters that Clinton would sign DOMA if passed in its current form. The next day Clinton said so himself, although he caused additional problems for the White House by inaccurately describing the bill at a news conference in Milwaukee. [A]s I understand it, the only legal effect of the bill is to make it clear that states can deny recognition of gay marriages that occurred in other states. And if thats all it does, then I will sign it, Clinton said ignoring Section 3 of DOMA in his comments and going on to talk about how he opposed discrimination. Name me another president who has been so pilloried for standing up for the fact that we shouldnt discriminate against any group of Americans, including gay Americans, who are willing to work hard, pay their taxes, obey the law, and be good citizens. Clinton made no comments about being concerned about momentum for a federal constitutional amendment barring same-sex couples from marrying, instead saying, [T]his has always been my position on gay marriage It was my position in 92. I told everybody who asked me about it, straight or gay, what my position was. I cant change my position on that; I have no intention of it. View this image  President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore greet supporters after a rally in Portland, Oregon, Friday, Sept. 20, 1996. Don Ryan / AP Photo Gore, for his part, was more circumspect in comments made the same day. While saying that he, like Clinton, believed marriage is the union between a man and a woman, a White House staffer, Patricia Lewis, detailed, He was asked whether the legislation in Congress was needed and he said some think yes, some think not, but that the president had indicated he would sign it. Over the course of the days that followed the presidents announcement, Scott was dealing with fallout. This is being seen as a clear and calculated signal from the White House that we are abandoning the gay and lesbian constituencies, she wrote to Fanning, noting that Stephanopoulos was publicly uninvited from a Human Rights Campaign dinner in San Francisco and that donors in New York are saying they will not work on the New York fundraiser. None of Scotts comments to Fanning even in this low moment for Clintons strongest advocates on gay issues suggest that the administration should consider explaining Clintons support for the bill as being justified as a measure to stop something worse: a federal constitutional amendment. The next week, Scott was continuing to deal with fallout, noting in an email to Enright that some of the most prominent donors and establishment advocates of the day within the gay community Jeff Soref, Jim Hormel, Sky Johnson, Keith Boykin, Elizabeth Birch, Hilary Rosen, and Dr. Scott Hitt had requested a meeting with Clinton. These are our friends, Scott wrote. They want to help but need our help to do so. The group meeting did not happen, one of the potential attendees told BuzzFeed News this week. View this image   The White House formally issued its Statement of Administration Policy regarding DOMA on July 11, detailing in advance of the House of Representatives vote on the bill that, although Clinton strongly opposes discrimination against any group of Americans, including gay and lesbian individuals, he nonetheless has long opposed same sex marriage. It concluded: Therefore, if H.R. 3396 were presented to the president as ordered reported from the House Judiciary Committee, the president would sign the legislation. The next day, the House passed DOMA on a 34265 vote. View this image  President Bill Clinton, Aug. 8, 1996. Mark J. Terrill / AP Photo Further White House discussions, including a memo from Socarides to Clinton the next week, focused on how to move beyond DOMA and, as Socarides put it, We may then talk about your accomplishments from appointments to your endorsement of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act to the removal of barriers in the granting of security clearances. With the DOMA decision finalized, much of the new talk was about making the case for and sharing word of Clintons support for the job bias bill, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA). A Sept. 3 memo from Stephanopoulos and Socarides to much of the senior White House staff focused as much on ENDA as DOMA. While ENDA initially was expected to be voted on as an amendment to DOMA, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott scheduled stand-alone votes on each bill. On Sept. 10, DOMA passed on a 8514 vote. ENDA failed, 4950. The next day, Stephanopoulos and Socarides updated the president on the two measures. The effort to pass ENDA (and its near success) has somewhat deflected attention away from the anti gay-marriage bill, they wrote, going on to detail inclusion in Clintons speech accepting the nomination at the Democratic convention a single reference to gay people in the course of a list of several types of people. There remain, however, strong feelings about the marriage bill and there will likely be some negative comments when it becomes law. View this image  Via assets.documentcloud.org Clinton signed DOMA into law at 12:50 a.m. Sept. 21, 1996, upon his return to Washington on the day the bill was sent to the White House from Capitol Hill. In a statement issued upon his signing of the bill, Clinton reiterated many of the talking points from the memos circulated within the White House in the prior seven months. Noting that he strenuously opposed discrimination of any kind, Clinton nonetheless said in the statement that he had long opposed governmental recognition of same-gender marriages. DOMA, he said in the statement, was limited to allowing states to make their own decisions about same-sex marriage and defining marriage as being only between one man and one woman under federal law. Clinton concluded by stating that DOMA should not be understood to provide an excuse for discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. This is so, he said in the statement, because [d]iscrimination, violence and intimidation for that reason, as well as others, violate the principle of equal protection under the law and have no place in American society the only reference to the Constitution in Clintons statement. Seventeen years later, Justice Anthony Kennedy would invoke that very same provision in striking down Section 3 of DOMA as unconstitutional.  On Dec. 9, 1996, after President Clinton was re-elected in a landslide against former Sen. Bob Dole, a student in New York sent a letter to the president. View this image  President Clinton Aug. 29, 1996. Elise Amendola / AP Photo I want to begin this informal letter by congratulating you on your victory on November 5, Adam Sanders wrote. He went on, though, to detail why your support of the DOMA legislation really upset me. He told Clinton, [Y]ou could have said I do not support gay marriages. That has always been my policy, but this bill is garbage legislation clearly aimed at exploiting and hurting one group of Americans for political gain. But you let the bigots win, and when they won you lost and America lost. Sanders, however, was willing to look forward: You have made a mistake in backing down but one act alone does not define a presidency or president. Please dont let me or America down. Less than two weeks later, on Dec. 20, 1996, Clinton wrote back to Sanders. Thank you for your letter. I read it with great appreciation for your deep belief in me and my Presidency, as well as understanding over our disagreement on the same-sex marriage bill, Clinton wrote. You can be sure that I will continue to seek the path of courage and wisdom that will help me lead our nation during the next four years. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!   by Katie J.M.

aS"The World Health Organization estimates that 3.7 billion people globally are infected with HSV-1, but thats not just oral herpes cases. View this image  Thats 3.7 billion people around the world. The report published yesterday in the journal PLOS ONE, and its the first time WHO gave global estimates for HSV-1. They used population data from 2012 to look at infection rates for people under the age of 50 across all the WHO regions. HSV-1 infection rates were highest in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Western Pacific; and there were 320 million cases in North and South America. View this image  There are two categories of the herpes virus: herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). Both are highly contagious and incurable, but theyre treatable. HSV-2 is almost exclusively transmitted through skin-to-skin genital contact, causing genital herpes. But HSV-1 is a little more complicated. It causes cold sores, and its mostly transmitted through oral-to-oral contact, but it can also lead to genital herpes when transmitted through oral sex. View on Instagram The new report estimates that 140 million people between the ages of 1549 have genital herpes from HSV-1 transmission (oral-to-genital contact). So even though we typically think of HSV-1 as the cold sore virus, its also contributing to a major number of genital herpes cases. Genital HSV-1 infections were more common in the Americas, Europe, and the Western Pacific, which could be due to the fact that people in these areas are becoming less likely to be infected with oral HSV-1 as children, and therefore theyre still susceptible to genital HSV-1 infection once they start having sex. View this image  If you have genital herpes, medication can shorten the time of an outbreak, according to the CDC. And daily suppressive therapy (daily antiviral meds) can reduce the risk of passing genital herpes on to your partner. For oral herpes or cold sores, antiviral medications (either in pill or cream form) can help them heal more quickly, according to the Mayo Clinic. To reduce the risk of transmission, avoid oral-to-oral or oral-to-genital contact when you have an outbreak, and dont share things like drinks, towels, utensils, lip balm, etc. View on Instagram Your doctor can usually diagnose cold sores and genital herpes just by looking at them, but they may also take a swab test if you have an outbreak. There are also blood tests that can test for antibodies of the herpes virus when you dont have an outbreak. For more information on STI testing, check out the BuzzFeed Health guide to getting tested. View this image  With more than two-thirds of the global population infected with HSV-1, its hard to see why a stigma still exists surrounding this and other STIs. HSV-1 can be transmitted through kissing and oral sex, but it can also be passed along by sharing a drink or using the same lip balm. Along those lines, HSV-2 can be transmitted through sexual contact regardless of whether or not you used a condom. That doesnt mean that you should throw safe sex habits out the window, but it does mean that viruses like this happen, they are common, and they say absolutely nothing about you or your self-worth.

aS"After a protest and multiple petitions, Tara Hudson was moved to an all-female prison in South Gloucestershire. View this image  After being sent to an all-male prison following a drunken attack on a bar manager, Tara Hudson, 26, applied to serve her 12-week sentence in an all-female prison instead. Hudson lost her appeal in the courts, but after protests in the area and multiple petitions signed by thousands of people, Hudson was reportedly moved to HM Prison Eastwood Park, an all-female prison in South Gloucestershire Friday. The judge who initially denied her appeal, Recorder Llewellyn Sellick, said it was for the prison service to decide where Tara Hudsons sentence would be served. It is for this court to decide the appropriate sentence, he said, according to Metro. If that sentence involves custody it is for the prison service and not this court to decide in which establishment this sentence is to be served. Campaigners concerned for her safety gathered outside the court to protest against the decision. View this image  During an interview with ITV West Country yesterday, Hudsons mother, Jackie Brooklyn, said her daughter, who has had six years of gender reassignment surgery, had said she was being sexually harassed by male prisoners. Men are constantly shouting at her from their cells, asking to see her boobs, Brooklyn said. Shes not in isolation, shes on a healthcare wing next to men. Its very distressing for her. She was only given clean underwear yesterday, before that she was wearing the same clothes she went to prison in. View this image  One of the campaigners and creator of the petition, Ceri Jenkins, said: Trans and other LGBT (lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, transgender) people are fighting a constant battle against oppressive systems and ideologies, and this can be so exhausting and disheartening. They need allies to step up to the plate, to help raise their voices, and to lift them to a place where they can be heard for themselves. In a statement, a Prison Service spokesperson said of Hudsons sentence: It is longstanding policy to place offenders according to their legally recognised gender. There are strict rules in place to ensure transsexual prisoners are managed safely and in accordance with the law. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Several high-profile political leaders on Thursday expressed support for LGBT protections in Houston, Texas, that voters will soon decide whether to uphold. View this image  AP / Robert F. Bukaty The White House, along with presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, expressed support Thursday for LGBT protections in Houston, Texas, that voters will soon decide whether to uphold. The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, known as HERO, has come under attack from those who say the protections go to far. Opponents of the law, passed by the City Council in 2014, have been pummeling the airwaves with an ad campaign deriding the law after successfully bringing the matter to a referendum in which voters will decide whether to uphold or overturn the protections. With just days until the election, several high-profile people have weighed in, including Oscar-winning actor Sally Field. On Thursday, Clinton tweeted her support for upholding the ordinance. No one should face discrimination for who they are or who they loveI support efforts for equality in Houston & beyond. #HERO #YesOnProp1 -H And in a rare move, the White House also weighed, although it stopped short of a full endorsement. White House spokesman Jeff Tiller said that while the Obama administration generally does not take formal positions on specific proposal or initiates, the president and vice president have been strong supporters of state and local efforts to protect Americans from being discriminated against based on who they are and who they love. Were confident that the citizens of Houston will vote in favor of fairness and equality, he added. The HERO law bans discrimination against 15 classes of people including racial minorities, women, people of faith, and LGBT people in housing, jobs, and public accommodations. However, activists with a group called Campaign for Houston which is running the campaign to repeal HERO has focused on LGBT people, particularly transgender women, who they consider men, being allowed to use public restrooms that correspond with their gender identity. In the process, they have deluged voters with commercials, phone calls, and mail that claim HERO would allow male sex predators to legally prowl womens restrooms in order to sexually assault young girls. Activists, elected officials, and police in Houston all say that message is untrue HERO would not legalize predatory behavior in bathrooms. But with five days until the election, opinion surveys show the race is tightening. 5. Sally Field Calls Ads About Men In Womens Restrooms Evil Lies buzzfeed.com 6.

aS"Joined by political leaders, Sally Field condemned ads that claim a nondiscrimination ordinance on Houstons ballot next week would allow male sex offenders to prey on women and girls in public restrooms. View this image  AP Images for Human Rights Campaign / Michael Stravato HOUSTON, Texas Its a lie. Its a lie. Its a lie. Its a lie. That was Sally Field on Thursday as she described an ad campaign currently running here in an attempt to repeal the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, known as HERO. Field stood abreast with a group of women political leaders in Texas who encouraged a yes vote on Nov. 3 to uphold the law and denounced the ad campaign as outright lies. Do you want to call it a lie, or shall I? Texas state Sen. Sylvia Garcia said when BuzzFeed News asked the women to comment on an onslaught of recent commercials that claim HERO would allow male sex predators to prowl womens restrooms in order to sexually assault young girls. Field stepped in. When I read what HERO really is, the Academy Award-winning actor told reporters, I was so amazed there is disagreement. Titled as Proposition 1 on Tuesdays ballot, HERO bans discrimination against 15 classes of people including racial minorities, women, people of faith, and LGBT people in places of housing, employment, and public accommodation. More than 200 jurisdictions in Texas already have LGBT nondiscrimination laws on the books, including many of states largest cities. Field who has a long track record of supporting LGBT rights noted there are no known incidents of nondiscrimination laws permitting men or transgender women to commit predatory acts in in restrooms. Not a single case of this, Field said. Not one single case has ever been reported. And believe me, if it had happened, it would have been reported. She added: Evil lies are evil lies. Politics can be nasty, but rarely do people deploy the L word with such vigor. View this image  Sally Field on Thursday with Councilmember Ellen Cohen, far left, a State Senator Sylvia Garcia, on the right in pink. BuzzFeed News / Dominic Holden After the Houston City Council passed HERO in 2014, activists with the Campaign for Houston ran a referendum to put the wide-ranging measure before voters in an attempt to repeal it. The groups message has dwelled on LGBT people, particularly transgender women who HERO opponents consider men being allowed to use public restrooms that correspond with their gender identity. Calling the fight underway here contentious would be an understatement yard signs, radio ads, and brutally effective television ads have pelted voters in the countys fourth largest city for the past two weeks with messages about bathrooms as the sole reason to oppose Prop 1. One TV ad features footage of a man trapping a small girl inside a restroom stall. This ordinance does allow perverted men to freely enter womens bathrooms, locker rooms, and showers invading their privacy when they are most vulnerable, says Rev. Kendall Baker in one of the radio ads. Its never OK to let men enter womens bathrooms and put women at risk. At the news conference, Houston City Council member Ellen Cohen said sexual assault does not happen by men putting on an outfit and walking into a womens restroom. She cited her 18 years as CEO of the Houston Area Womens Center, devotion to protecting women and children before blasting the anti-HERO ad campaign. Its bogus. Its incorrect, Cohen said. The facts are that sexual assault happens from someone who knows the victim. The bathroom message, she added, is a complete lie. Garcia took the mic after Field and Cohen made their comments. Bottom line: Its a lie, Garcia said, and she ended the news conference. Houstons police chief this month confirmed that such scenarios would remain illegal under HERO. Still, Campaign for Houston which did not reply to requests to comment regarding the factual basis for the ads has referred to the law almost exclusively as the bathroom ordinance. And the message appears to be effective. Several sources close to the Houston Unites campaign to uphold HERO told BuzzFeed News that polls have tightened in recent days, putting the yes and no sides in a statistical dead heat. BuzzFeed News interviewed more than a dozen voters on the streets of Houston this week. While only a handful had heard of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, all had heard about the bathroom ordinance. Several of those voters, having no idea the law on the ballot Tuesday had a wider scope than just restroom use, said they were voting no after hearing claims that it would endanger women and children from rapists who lurk in restrooms.

aS"A California couple filed a lawsuit Tuesday alleging a police officer arrested them while on vacation in Hawaii for public displays of affection. View this image  Courtney Wilson, left, and Taylor Guerrero in Honolulu on Oct. 28. Jennifer Sinco Kelleher / AP The Honolulu Police Department said Wednesday it is opening an internal investigation after a lawsuit was filed by a same-sex couple who said they were arrested for kissing in a grocery store. Courtney Wilson, 25, and Taylor Guerrero, 21, who were vacationing in Hawaii from Los Angeles, filed their lawsuit in federal court on Tuesday, claiming that Officer Bobby Harrison harassed and arrested them on March 3 for public displays of affection in a Foodland store on Oahu. The lawsuit claims the officer was shopping at the grocery store in uniform, when he saw the couple walking through the aisles holding hands, hugging, and kissing, and in a loud voice, ordered plaintiffs to stop and take it somewhere else. We were just being goofy, Wilson said to BuzzFeed News in describing the couples affection. The women continued to shop and at a later point started touching again, when Harrison saw them he threatened to have them thrown out of the store. As the women were attempting to check out, Harrison approached the couple a third time. When Wilson tried to call 911, the officer grabbed her arm, Wilson said. Wilson said Guerrero then tried to step in between her and the officer, and then he shoved her. She fell and hit her head on the counter, Wilson said. When she fell, she kicked up, so the officer got kicked. At this point, the officer also threw Wilson to the ground and said she was under arrest for assaulting an officer. Instinctually, I tried to shove him off [Guerrero], and the officer got hit, Wilson continued. And in return, I got hit. Foodland employees were told to hold the women down and they were bound with zip ties, Wilson said, because the officer was off-duty and didnt have his handcuffs. The two were arrested and charged with felony assault of an officer, but the charges were dismissed five months later. View this image  Courtney Wilson The couples lawyer, Eric Seitz, said despite the fact the Foodland employees acknowledged at the preliminary hearing there was security footage that they had seen, they have since been told the tapes were unattainable. Foodland apologized to the couple for the incident, Wilson said, even though they are not part of the lawsuit. View this image  Courtney Wilson The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified monetary damages, claims Harrison acted with hostility because of his hate toward the LGBT community. The officer remains on full active duty, Honolulu police spokeswoman Michelle Yu confirmed to BuzzFeed News. We just want an example to made of this officer, after 26 years on the force, were not the first people he portrayed this bigot behavior towards, Wilson said.

View this image  Dominic Holden/BuzzFeed News WASHINGTON The Obama administration filed a groundbreaking legal brief in a federal appeals court on Wednesday evening, supporting a transgender students challenge to his schools policy banning him from using the restroom that corresponds with his gender identity. The move at the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Gavin Grimms case is the strongest step yet from the Obama administration to advance its position supporting the right of transgender people to seek legal protections under current civil rights laws. Prohibiting a transgender male student from using boys restrooms, when other non-transgender male students face no such restriction, deprives him not only of equal educational opportunity but also of equal status, respect, and dignity, lawyers from the Justice and Education departments wrote in the brief. Grimm, a transgender male, has sued his school district, Gloucester County School District in Virginia, alleging that the districts policy violates the ban on sex discrimination in education under Title IX of the Education Act of 1972. After the federal district court judge rejected his request for an injunction keeping the school from enforcing its policy barring him from using the male restrooms at the school, he appealed to the 4th Circuit. The Obama administration, following the analysis in a 2012 ruling from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, has found that the ban on sex discrimination in existing civil rights laws includes a ban on discrimination against transgender people. Wednesday nights filing, however, is the first time the administration has weighed in on the issue in an appeals court. That is an important distinction because a decision in the case would apply to all federal cases filed within the circuit not just to this students case. Treating a student adversely because the sex assigned to him at birth does not match his gender identity is literally discrimination on the basis of sex, the administration lawyers wrote in the brief.

View this image  View this image  The Australian Broadcasting Corporation did a feature on Healy and her family on Wednesday after Healys daughter Jessica Walton wrote a book for children about being transgender. Healy told BuzzFeed News that her daughter decided to write the book after she found there was little reading material for kids about being transgender. When I heard what she had planned, and showed me the Kickstarter video she had put together, it was such a beautiful display of love and acceptance, she said. However, Healy said her mom accepted her immediately. And she said at the end of it, she said, Well, she said, What do you know? She said, Ive got a beautiful new daughter. And she said, Come here, love, Healy told the ABC. I go and see Mum every few weeks and shes forgotten each time, and every time I tell her again, she gives me just the same beautiful reaction that she did exactly the same, almost word for word every time. Im kind of the luckiest one of all because I get to come out to Mum 100 times a year, and every time, shes beautiful.

I just sat there at my computer and cried the happiest tears. So much about being trans relates to acceptance and feeling loved as yourself. The book captured all that and more. She said that her family is sharing their story because she wants people to know that transitioning as transgender is not just about movie stars like Caitlyn Jenner. Its about ordinary everyday people doing their best to be authentic and genuine, she said. Its about ordinary people, ordinary families, ordinary communities trying to come to terms with something that challenges so many societal taboos. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS'The 2003 movie musical Camp showed theater geeks how to own their outcast status. Director and writer Todd Graff, the cast, and Stephen Sondheim tell BuzzFeed News how the film no one wanted to make turned into a queer cult classic. View this image  Photo illustration by Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News; Photos: Courtesy IFC Films; Everett Collection (4) We open on a girls face. She stares back at us as she begins to sing her vocal power gorgeous and staggering. The camera spins around, eventually revealing the young people assembled around her in the woods, of various ages and ethnicities, who join together to form the chorus of How Shall I See You Through My Tears? from the obscure 1983 musical The Gospel at Colonus. While the show might not be familiar to all but the most diehard theater fans, the song has become indelibly linked to the 2003 film Camp, and to Sasha Allens stirring rendition. Its the first thing viewers of the cult classic musical about kids at theater camp hear, setting the stage for so much of whats to come: the campers raw talent on display, the isolation they experience in their troubled home lives, and the way the fictional Camp Ovation based on the famous Stagedoor Manor, where the movie was filmed offers a respite for these outcasts. Its the perfect opening, and its thematically essential to what follows. But it almost didnt happen. We had no contingencies. We had very little money, Camp writer-director Todd Graff told BuzzFeed News. The sequence was going to take place outdoors on one of the last nights of filming in September 2002. Then it started to rain, and I mean like biblical, torrential, piss-down rain. The cast retreated to a giant tent, and in order to will the rain away, they huddled together and sang spirituals. Bless their hearts, they really believed they could make it stop raining if they prayed hard enough and sang loud enough, Graff said. And boy, they tried. But it just didnt happen. View this image  Sasha Allen sings How Shall I See You Through My Tears? in the opening scene of Camp. Courtesy IFC Films As night became morning, Graff was forced to face the reality that he was most likely going to have to cut How Shall I See You Through My Tears? from the finished film. Then, an idea struck him: If they added a last night on top of the last day of shooting, they could try again. It would mean working 24 hours straight for most of the cast and crew, but miraculously enough, everyone agreed. Its freezing cold and its 5 oclock in the morning and theyre wearing sleeveless whatever, and Im having them suck ice cubes so that you cant see their breath when theyre singing, Graff said. Theyre like hypothermic doing this thing, but they were really doing it for Sasha. They just couldnt imagine her number not being in the movie. It was after the sun had come up, and everybody just stepped up. And we got it. It was the very last thing we shot. Its a scene that underlines the films themes, and its dramatic behind-the-scenes story captures the camaraderie and tight-knit community spirit that made Camp such a success among the people it was made for: the misfits, the losers, the theater geeks. Theater people! Graff exclaimed, reminiscing about the way How Shall I See You Through My Tears? came together. We take care of our own. Camp is the kind of movie youve either never heard of or can quote verbatim. If you fall into the latter category, theres a good chance you saw it in theaters back in the summer of 2003. Most likely you were a teenager, or at least close enough to being a teenager to still remember what it felt like to be a high school misfit, loser, and/or theater geek. Because this was never a movie for the popular kids; it was crafted especially for that latter group a particularly awkward and, at the time, underrepresented subset of high school outcasts. Camp is about how your love of show tunes could be an asset instead of a mark against you. If you loved the movie, you were different, and chances are, what appealed to you about it was the way it encouraged you to embrace that weirdness, not to run from it. At the films center are Ellen (Joanna Chilcoat), a lovelorn loser forced to take her own brother to the prom, and Michael (Robin de Jess), a sometimes drag queen beaten up by his fellow students and disowned by his parents over his sexuality. Over the course of the summer, Ellen and Michael fall for the charms of supposed straight boy Vlad (Daniel Letterle), who has no problem commanding the attention he so desperately craves. View this image  Fritzi (Anna Kendrick), Ellen (Joanna Chilcoat), Michael (Robin de Jess), and Jenna (Tiffany Taylor) have an awkward lunch. IFC Films / Everett Collection The campers who were played by unknown actors chosen more for their ability to belt than for how they looked shirtless are united by their passion for theater and their inability to fit in with the so-called normal kids they spend most of the year with. For these teenagers, Camp Ovation represents a sort of Mecca: Its the place they go once a year to escape societys restrictive limitations. Here, they can be as loud and as queer as they want to be, free from the shame that would otherwise silence them. Its a pleasant fantasy, and one that Camps target audience the same kinds of outcasts depicted in the film could not resist. It offered a home away from home where talent was prized above looks, nerdy knowledge was an asset, and heterosexuals were the minority. And somewhere out there, Camp Ovation was real. Graff based his script for Camp on Stagedoor Manor, which he attended first as a camper and later as a counselor and musical director. But a lot had changed since he started going in 1975. It was a very different kind of place than it is today. Today, its still insane, but its insane within a kind of structure, he said. You dont fear for the lives of the children. You get the feeling that they actually sleep at night and they get fed meals and whatever, even though theyre rehearsing a million hours a day and its craziness. Stagedoor Manor did have its issues in the 70s Graff remembered a scabies outbreak one year and another when the camp decided to remedy its negligent fire safety measures by having the scene shop build fire escapesout of wood. Child services came and they said, You cant have 150 kids here with wooden fire escapes, Graff recalled. They shut it down. But generally, the Stagedoor Manor that Graff remembered is a lot closer to Camps Camp Ovation. (And ownership has also since shifted.) The aspects of Stagedoor that most directly inspired the movie the crazy production schedule and the passion of the campers lingered with Graff for decades as he searched for a creative outlet through which to filter his experiences. I always felt that there was a story in it. I didnt know if it was a stage musical or a movie or what, he said. I went off and had my acting career and my writing career, and then decided I wanted to direct because I was unhappy with the way the movies I was writing were turning out when they were handed to other directors. So I had to figure out what movie that would be for someone to allow me to direct. View this image  A promotional shot of the cast. From left: Joanna Chilcoat, Alana Allen, Sasha Allen, Daniel Letterle, Robin de Jess, and Tiffany Taylor. IFC Films / Everett Collection The answer was Camp. What Graff had written was so specific to musical theater as a whole and to his experiences in particular that it wouldnt make sense to hand it off to another director. He first wrote the screenplay on spec and staged it as a workshop, as if Camp were a stage musical. But as Graff began to look for funding to make his workshop a film in earnest, he realized he was fighting an uphill battle. As Graff struggled to find producers, he realized the specificity that made Camp perfect for his directorial debut would be a challenge, as would the films subject matter, which was more controversial than hed intended. View this image  Camps queerness is as relentless as it is glorious. This is a movie in which campers of all ages don drag to cheer up their morose friend, in which a gay boy seduces and has sex with his female friend just to prove he can, and in which the objectification of the sole straight guy is presented as the unavoidable consequence of perfect abs. Back then, there was no way you were gonna have two boys one naked, manipulating the other, whos a drag queen, who gets queer-bashed in the first scene and theyre about to kiss, Graff said, referring to the films final moments, in which Vlad suggestively confesses his sexual confusion to Michael, whether out of genuine interest or just to get him worked up. It just was not gonna happen. At one point, Graff brought his script to Paramount, where he was asked if he could transform the outcasts of Camp Ovation from queer kids to Trekkies. (There was, after all, cross-promotion at stake for Paramount, which owns Star Trek.) They said, Well, you know kids at that age who are very into Star Trek often have a very tough time. They get picked on, they get bullied, Graff recalled. I said, Do you really equate being a Star Trek fan with being a 15-year-old queer-bashed drag queen? He refused to give in. Of course, that meant he had to search even harder for the support necessary to make his film. It was clear pretty early on it was not gonna get made [by a major studio]. And so I sold my house and moved to New York, he said. I did nothing but try to make this movie for four years, in the way it was written. Eventually, he got funding from Killer Films and IFC Films (Camp producer Michael Shamberg is now an adviser to BuzzFeed Motion Pictures), but there were still hurdles to overcome. Casting, in particular, was not going to be easy. Graff was looking for raw talent young people who looked, felt, and acted like the characters he had written. One of the first kids cast was Anna Kendrick: Along with Sasha Allen, she was the only actor to make the transition from Graffs workshop productions of Camp to the final film. At the time, Kendrick had never made a movie, but she had already made her mark on Broadway in the show High Society, which starred Graffs cousin, Randy. To me, Anna was Anna Banana, Randys little friend from her show, for years, he said. When we shot Camp, she was 16, so Id known her for several years before we ever made the movie, and I just always knew this kid was amazing. She was a very precocious kid, but she was cool. She was not obnoxious. She was a kid you liked hanging out with. View this image  Kendrick as Fritzi. Courtesy IFC Films Kendricks Fritzi an ambitious and possibly homicidal young camper was a scene-stealer, but Camp largely came down to the relationships between Michael, Vlad, and Ellen. Graff held auditions at Stagedoor Manor, among other places, and he also enlisted the help of Broadway casting director Bernie Telsey, who because hed helped cast Hairspray and Rent had a database of talented young performers to choose from. They would go all over the country looking for people for all of the companies of those shows, Graff said. And they would always have kids who were too young, and so all those kids we could draw from. Having said that, it was a long process. It was a real thing. It was Bernie putting up flyers at schools. We saw a ton of kids in order to finally end up with the ones that we got. Graff also went to a former college classmate who had become a dance teacher. Among the teachers students was Chilcoats younger sister, and when the teacher asked if Graff needed singers too, she was at the top of the list. At that point, Chilcoat was still living in Baltimore, where she had been performing in dinner theater from the age of 9. And she was immediately drawn to the character breakdown for Ellen. The character description [was], Ellen is undergoing an unfortunate adolescent collision of smart mind, loud voice, and chunky body, Chilcoat recalled. And I remember being like, Im not that chunky, but yeah, thats pretty much me. For Michael, Graff cast Robin de Jess, who had heard about an open call through a teacher at his school and arrived to audition with, as Graff remembers it, a zillion others. De Jess grew up poor in the projects of Connecticut and had never been to a Broadway show. His only experience with musical theater had been listening to original cast albums he checked out from the library, and that innocence added to the authenticity that Graff was looking for. Also authentic: de Jesss less-than-perfect skin, which ended up being one of Michaels character traits. He came in looking like that, Graff said. I have to say that if he had insisted on covering his zits, I would have let him rather than expose him that way, but he was the one who from the beginning said, I think this is Michael. (De Jess did not respond to BuzzFeed News request for an interview.) View this image  Jill (Alana Allen) makes a move on Vlad (Letterle). AF Archive / Alamy The part of Vlad had been cast, but Graff ultimately deemed Daniel Letterle a better fit for the role when a theater agent submitted him after he got back from doing West Side Story in Germany. As with Chilcoat, Letterle was distinctly drawn to the characters connection to his own real-life experiences. The whole reason I think I wanted to be an actor is because I wanted to be liked. I totally identified with that. It wasnt a stretch, Letterle told BuzzFeed News in an interview over Skype. Youre around theater people all the time and youre always sort of competing for attention and always trying to be cute and funny and hip and everything. And thats what Vlad was. The rest of the cast included Alana Allen as mean girl Jill, Vince Rimoldi and Steven Cutts as gay campers Spitzer and Shaun (respectively), Tiffany Taylor as jaw-wired-shut Jenna, and musician and music producer Don Dixon as alcoholic composer Bert Hanley. DeQuina Moore, who went on to join the original Broadway cast of Legally Blonde and the 2003 revival of Little Shop of Horrors, had a smaller role as a camper also named DeQuina. View this image  Cutts was the last person to join the cast. He was called in to audition at Graffs home, where the rest of the cast was gathered for a rehearsal. [Graff] was like, Do you feel comfortable doing this in front of everybody? I was like, Yeah, kind of, Cutts recalled to BuzzFeed News in an interview over Skype. He had everybody turn around. Once the entire cast had been assembled, they bonded quickly. During the rehearsal period, the teenagers lived near each other and explored New York City together while learning their parts. Nobody can really understand the kind of family that grew up around that film, said Chilcoat, who was, at 16, one of the youngest actors in the film. It was such a unique experience. But even with funding and casting set, there were still more challenges ahead for Graff, like getting the rights to all the music he wanted to use before filming began. He described his music choices as very my taste and my experiences. He chose Turkey Lurkey Time because his cousin had appeared in Promises, Promises, which he had seen countless times at a young age. And he chose Im Still Here plus the snippet of Losing My Mind the kids sing on the bus to camp because Stagedoor Manor had put on a production of Follies while he was working there. That always seemed like a pretty good example of just how insane the show choices can be at this camp, Graff said. We really did that. We really had a 14-year-old with braces singing Im Still Here. Wild Horses, the song Vlad auditions for Camp Ovation with, was chosen simply because it was popular when Graff attended Stagedoor, but it wasnt his first choice. Graff had written the Allman Brothers song Sweet Melissa into the script, based on the real audition of the actor playing Jesus in a production of Jesus Christ Superstar that Graff directed in college. But the Allman Brothers refused to license the song to an indie film, especially one with a budget of, as Graff put it, like $11. Camps music supervisor, Linda Cohen, suggested Graff go with his second choice which she was horrified to learn was a Rolling Stones song. She said, Theres just no way. Theyre not a charitable organization, the Stones, Graff remembered. But she gave it a shot and it went all the way to Mick Jagger reading the script, and I think they charged us $250 or something crazy for Wild Horses. It was like, Fuck you, Allman Brothers. Aside from Mick Jagger, Camps other major savior was Stephen Sondheim, who came on board early after sending letters back and forth with Graff and reading the script. He gave Graff permission to use his entire oeuvre, and his involvement proved essential to getting other composers to grant permission for their music at prices the production could afford. When it has the Sondheim imprimatur, its really the gold standard. Everybody else lined up behind him, Graff said. Even though it looks like we need an $8 million music licensing budget, in fact weve gotten all these songs for under $100,000 total. With the music rights in order, filming on Camp could finally begin. The actors relocated to the real Stagedoor Manor in Loch Sheldrake, New York, where they moved into actual bunks, allowing for an authentic camp experience. We would have campfires at night and sing-alongs, Letterle said. Chilcoat remembered sleepovers and mischief, noting that all the adults stayed at the edge of camp, giving the young actors some degree of freedom. (Child services were also on the premises, Graff was quick to note.) It was like we were teleported back to camp days for real, Cutts said. There were specific cliques. Certain people had parties and youd stumble in, like, Oh, you guys are getting together? It was something. Essentially, it was just kids being kids. Or, at least, theater kids being theater kids. It was a lot of fun, Letterle said. It was exhausting, though, too. The entire film, including nine full musical numbers, was shot over 18 days. Those days were tightly packed, and the musical numbers see How Shall I See You Through My Tears? were particularly challenging. View this image  Turkey Lurkey Time. IFC Films / Everett Collection In one of the films most memorable sequences, campers simultaneously perform Follies and Promises, Promises: The action shifts between Lisa (Julie Kleiner) belting Im Still Here and Jill leading the ensemble in a show-stopping performance of Turkey Lurkey Time. The scene required Kleiner to do double duty, simply because Graff did not have enough actors to fill out the Promises, Promises ensemble without her. So although shes very clearly performing Im Still Here, shes also singing Turkey Lurkey Time in a blonde wig. And I literally have close-ups of her, Graff said, laughing. I go from a close-up of her doing Im Still Here across camp to a close-up of her in Turkey Lurkey. The other challenge with that particular scene: Patrick Cubbedge who played Patrick, one of the younger campers got sick and began vomiting mid-performance, not unlike a scene in Camp in which Jill throws up repeatedly while singing The Ladies Who Lunch. Cubbedge, who had woken up at 3 a.m. to do the scene, refused to quit, just like Jill, who continues singing until Fritzi, who has poisoned her, takes over. He got up there and he danced his heart out, Graff said of Cubbedge. He wanted to send the young actor back to bed, but Cubbedge refused. He would do a take, he would go outside, he would throw up, theyd give him a bunch of water, he would come in, he would do a take, he would go outside, he would vomit. But perhaps Graffs biggest feat was getting Sondheim to appear as himself, something Graff had written into the script that the iconic composer initially refused to take part in. But when Graff explained to Sondheim that if he wouldnt do it himself, he would have to find a lookalike or pick another composer at Sondheims level (of which there are none), Sondheim said yes at the very last minute. View this image  And once he was on set, Sonheim refused any special treatment, even staying in one of the Stagedoor bunks instead of at a hotel. Yes, it was just like real camp, except that Stephen Sondheim shows up one day, and youre like, What? Chilcoat remembered. It was really, really remarkable that he did that for somebody. He didnt owe me anything its not like I had starred in four of his musicals and I asked for a favor, Graff said. I was just this guy saying, Nobody ever makes movies for kids who are into musical theater, ever. Even Fame is not that. And he said OK. Sondheim is humble, to say the least, about his involvement with Camp. He told BuzzFeed News he was motivated not only by Graffs sincere pleas, but by the appeal of playwright Arthur Laurents, a friend and supporter of Graffs. I had a good time on the shoot, and thought (and think) I was terrible in the movie, Sondheim wrote in an email. But I dont regret it. Though he was able to keep the Sondheim scene intact, Graff did continue to modify his script as filming went on. And one of the most contentious discussions was over the relationship between Vlad and Michael, and just how far that final scene between them should go. After all, Graff wanted to make sure Camp earned a PG-13 rating to make it accessible to the very teens it was about. Vlad presents as most likely straight, and Graff based that character in part on himself: a repressed gay teenager whose opposite-sex bed-hopping behavior reflects his underlying sexual confusion. Im gay, but I cant be gay yet, so Ill manipulate every girl around, because the girls at the camp are girls that generally speaking dont ever get dates 10 months a year, so here, if any boy pays attention to them, theyre very easy, Graff said of Vlads mindset. It was that thing of working through your own sexuality by manipulating people around you. View this image  Ellen and Vlad share a moment. IFC Films / Everett Collection And so when Vlad, naked and dripping wet from the lake, tells Michael that hes not sure what he wants, he might actually be sincere, which raised an interesting question: Would these two boys actually consummate their muddled relationship? We were sort of navigating how far to push the last scene. Its like, Should there be a kiss? Should there not? Should he push his head down? Should he not? Graff recalled. Thirteen years ago, there was just no way you were gonna be able to have two underage boys make out and not become a thing. It was also something that Letterle struggled with. One of the ideas came up that Michael and Vlad have a sexual encounter. It freaked me out at the time, so I said no, he remembered. But I think that would have been fine if that would have happened. It would have made sense. I dont know. I wasnt ready yet. Graff hoped that the changes he made would ultimately broaden Camps audience, without sacrificing the authenticity that would endear it to the outcasts who never saw themselves depicted onscreen. But in terms of box office numbers, they didnt help. The domestic gross for Camp was just $1.6 million, although it went on to make $2.7 million worldwide. View this image  And reviews were mixed. Rolling Stones Peter Travers called Camp the modestly perfect antidote to a synthetic, overblown movie summer: a blast of exuberant fun that stays rooted in humanity, while Michael Wilmington at the Chicago Tribune said it was shallow, forced and phony in some of the same ways that Fame was a phony picture of the New York High School for Performing Arts. And this film doesnt have the compensating gloss, energy and excitement of Fame. There were some really out-and-out raves, like from Rolling Stone or [Ty Burr at the Boston Globe] like serious real critics who gave it true money-quote kind of reviews, Graff said. And then there were critics that absolutely hated it. They didnt know what to make of this thing. They just didnt get it. But the response from the theater community was nearly uniformly positive, which is what Graff had hoped for all along. He always knew the audience would be somewhat limited, so he was more fixated on authenticity: Camp needed to work for the people it was about. And if its cult status among young people is any indication, it did achieve what the filmmaker set out to do. All of the actors described enthusiastic encounters with fans, a phenomenon that has only increased over the years. Its absolutely incredible, Chilcoat said of getting recognized for the film. I cant believe its been 12 years and people are still talking about it, this tiny little movie. Graff remembered getting letters from those who were touched and inspired by the film the outcasts that he had made a point of showcasing found comfort in its honest depiction of diverse sexuality and gender expression. It was a formative film for a bunch of people. Im very proud that it found its way to those people, Graff said. For a bunch of kids who really felt like, Im just some kid somewhere, and I had no idea that a place like this exists, or other kids like this existed like me, that were cross-dressing, or liked other boys, or were into musical theater all those kinds of thingsthere was just not a lot out there for them. But for most of the performers looking for their big breaks, thrilled by the chance to finally showcase their talent, Camp wasnt quite the star-making turn theyd anticipated. Letterle in particular had a rough go of things after Camps release. Despite the fact that he was the films lead, showing off both his theater training and his well-placed muscles, he starred in one other movie, 2005s gay indie comedy The Unfabulous Social Life of Ethan Green, before fading into obscurity. I thought I was going to the moon, man, Letterle said. I thought that was it. I made it. Its easy street from here on out. Boy, was I wrong. View this image  Graff dances with cast members during the afterparty for the New York premiere of Camp on July 21, 2003, in New York City. Scott Gries / Getty Images Letterle returned to his home state of Ohio in 2006, a year after Ethan Greens release, and has stayed out of the public eye since. When BuzzFeed News first asked Graff if he knew how to contact his former star, Graff said it had been years since hed heard from him. But Letterles seeming disappearance had nothing to do with Camp and everything to do with his personal demons. Im still off the radar. Look, I have bipolar disorder and I was a drug addict, basically, he confided. I struggled for probably about seven or eight years. View this image  Letterle is refreshingly honest about his life after Camp, and the way his Hollywood dreams didnt pan out as expected. His story is one of the harsh realities of fame: Sometimes talent isnt enough. Survival for a working actor isnt just about getting people to know your name, and Camps burgeoning cult in the years following its release did little to help Letterle. I was homeless for a while, but I had a Facebook account, he said, noting that he lived out of his car in L.A. for a year after finishing Camp. I would go to the library, mainly to sit in the air conditioning, and Id talk to my fans, and it was just this surreal experience. Like, I have fans. Im homeless, but I have fans. At that point in my life, it felt like, I should use these fans and try to build something up, but nobody wanted to talk to me. I was a lousy piece of shit at the time. And yet Letterle is far from bitter. Hes now happily married to his wife, Danielle, and working at a restaurant, far removed from his brief stint as a leading man. But he looks back fondly on his experience with Camp. I have nothing but good things to say about it. It was a great experience, and all the people I met were wonderful. Those are some of my fondest memories, no doubt, said Letterle, who recently reached out to Graff in advance of a trip to New York. I always wanted to be the star of a movie, and I was. Maybe I didnt live that life, but I set out to do it and I did it, and it was one of my greatest accomplishments. I think what I learned is that anything is possible if you really give your whole self to it. Camps most mainstream success story is Kendrick, who broke through in 2009 with her role in Up in the Air, for which she was nominated for an Oscar. Since then, shes gone on to big-budget franchises (the Twilight and Pitch Perfect series), modern movie musicals (Into the Woods and The Last Five Years), and acclaimed indies (Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas). View this image  But while Kendrick who was unavailable to be interviewed for this story might be the most well-known former Camp star, shes not the only actor to have continued working. Her co-stars, however, have mostly made their marks in theater. De Jess earned Tony nominations for Lin-Manuel Mirandas In the Heights and for the 2010 revival of La Cage aux Folles. Currently, hes playing Boq in Wicked on Broadway. View this image  Robin de Jess as Boq in Wicked. Joan Marcus Sasha Allen toured as the Leading Player in Pippin and was in the 2009 Broadway revival of Hair. (If you listen to the cast album, shes the soloist on Aquarius.) She gained more recognition when she appeared on the fourth season of The Voice. To be in high school and to do this workshop, and then to be in college and to do the movie, it was really the beginning of me figuring myself out, me starting a career, me learning the rules of being a working actor, Allen told BuzzFeed News in a phone interview. Todd really gave me my real start. It also was the start to a deep friendship between Allen and Cutts, who said the two are basically married. Before he got the gig in Camp, Cutts was still nursing his wounds after being replaced when Hairspray moved to Broadway. (He had left school to appear in the original workshop as Seaweed J. Stubbs.) During filming, he caught the attention of Camp choreographer Jerry Mitchell, who was also the choreographer for Hairspray. After working with him on Camp, he invited me to audition for Hairspray. I ended up doing three or four companies of Hairspray, Cutts said. It picked me up right at the perfect time when I was down and I was really questioning whether I had what it took to do this. Chilcoat tried to continue acting after Camp, retaining an agent and going on several auditions. But she didnt want to move to New York, and while she was working as a long-term high school substitute teacher and working on her masters in education, she discovered acting wasnt her priority. [My agent] was like, Look, you either need to commit to this 110% or you need to back out, basically, she recalled. And I was like, you know what? Ive got to finish school. Ive got to keep my job. But theres still a bit of Camp in Chilcoat: She now teaches film, theater, and television production, which means she gets all the nice, wonderful, weird, smelly kids the same outcasts that she numbered herself among when she auditioned for the movie more than a decade ago. As a kid, I was never good at sports. I was never really good at socializing or talking to people or making friends. I was good at theater, she said. And theater gave me a family, and theater gave me a community. And I knew that when I grew up, I needed to do something to spread that. Chilcoat doesnt tell her students that she was once the star of a movie musical, but they inevitably figure it out, especially now in the age of Google. My favorite is when a kid comes running up to me and goes, Ms. Chilcoat, did you know you were in a movie? And Im like, What? I was? Thats crazy, she said, laughing. And sometimes, she does watch Camp with the students in her film class, providing them with behind-the-scenes context. Theyre fascinated by Chilcoats unique perspective and appropriately amused by seeing her make out with Letterle. But watching herself onscreen is not always the most pleasant experience. Director me wants to shake actor me, Chilcoat confessed. It kind of reminds me of why I never film my performances at my school, because nothing is ever quite as perfect as you think it was. The film itself, it has this fun, quirky kind of energy to it. Basically, whenever I watch it, I just want to shake younger me and be like, Act better! For Letterle, watching Camp these days is difficult, despite the fact that hes now living a happy, healthy life. I couldnt watch it, he admitted. It was sad. That was me. That was a really good time in my life. Look at how good-looking and young I was. Letterle paused again. It was hard to watch. It was just surreal, his wife Danielle interjected. It was you watching the former version of yourself. View on Instagram sashaallenmusic / Via instagram.com The last time Cutts watched Camp was in October 2013, when 54 Below (now Feinsteins/54 Below) hosted a 10th anniversary screening. Graff was there, along with Chilcoat, Allen, and de Jess, among other cast members. Both Graff and Cutts mentioned the strangeness of watching Camp with an audience that knew all the words. The film hasnt reached Rocky Horror levels of midnight movie madness, but its fans are passionate and loyal. They made the 54 Below screening an interactive experience, one that gave Cutts a new perspective on the film. I can say that I appreciated it more, he said. I definitely get having so much raw talent now, because a lot of us were green, especially to film. There were a lot of people that had theater experience, but It translated well. Its so visceral how new it was for everybody, and it translated. Its been 12 years since Camp was released. The films persistent queerness is no longer as revolutionary as it was in the early 2000s, but its influence remains. View this image  Ryan Murphy, for example, was a big fan of Camp, as he once gushed to Graff. He went on to co-create Glee, which also followed the lives of misfit performing arts kids and was another major step forward for LGBT representation onscreen. Ive been stopped so many times by kids who were affected by the movie and said that the movie saved their lives, Cutts said. Ive heard it before and I felt moved by it, but just to hear it from more and more people is overwhelming. I know that it is a necessary thing for us to be involved in that way, and Im glad that [Camp] was doing that when I wasnt even aware. The effect of movies like Camp (and shows like Glee) is that queer people are more mainstream than ever. Of course thats a good thing, but its something Graff has struggled with while working on the forthcoming Camp sequel. He said the theme of Camp 2, whose Indiegogo campaign will launch early next year, is how normal everything has become that was so outlaw then. Theres a danger in losing your outlaw status, Graff explained. The trick has always been to make the box bigger, not to figure out how to fit inside the preexisting box. Its not about aping straight conventions if youre the gay kid. But while queerness itself might be inching more and more toward normalcy, there will always be those who dont fit in whether because they cant or because they dont want to. And they shouldnt have to, as Graff stressed in his original screenplay for Camp: Uniqueness is an asset. Camp is a film about teaching young people to sing out, to showcase their strengths and weaknesses, and that they can be celebrated without ever having to conform. No matter how inclusive society seems to be now, there will always be those on the fringes. And for those outcasts, regardless of how much time passes, Camps subversive pleasures will always be richly needed and undeniably valuable. Its so great to be able to share that you can be weird and you can be a total mess if you want to be, Chilcoat said, and somebody is still going to care about you. Thats a sentiment that Graff has kept in mind as he works toward bringing Camp to a new generation with his sequel, which he noted is not a retreat from what the first movie was, but rather trying to kick the ball further down the field. What about the kid who now lost the place where they didnt feel isolated? That place now has its own rituals and normalcy. And if you dont fit into it, youre sort of back where you started, Graff said. But one will always find ones own community. [The outcasts] find their own within the larger whole.

aS"Texas Outhouse, a portable restroom business, donated to a political campaign that argues Houstons nondiscrimination law will encourage transgender sex predators to prey on girls in public restrooms. View this image  Campaign for Houston advertisement Via youtube.com A political campaign in Houston thats become fixated on restrooms has attracted the support of a fitting donor: a toilet company. Texas Outhouse, which delivers and services portable johns, gave $5,000 to the Campaign for Houston on Oct. 19, according to a campaign finance report released Monday. Campaign for Houston is attempting to repeal the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance in a Nov. 3 ballot referendum. The measure, which is on hold until Tuesdays vote, bans discrimination against a wide range of classes including people of color, women, and LGBT people. However, Campaign for Houston has whittled down its message to a nearly singular focus of men in womens restrooms a reference to transgender women in a barrage of commercials and other election materials that claim the bathroom ordinance would encourage male sex predators to attack young girls. This ordinance does allow perverted men to freely enter womens bathrooms, locker rooms, and showers invading their privacy when they are most vulnerable, says Rev. Kendall Baker in one of the radio ads. Its never okay to let men enter womens bathrooms and put women at risk. Meanwhile, a new TV commercial from the campaign shows a man following a young girl in a bathroom and trapping her inside a stall. City officials and LGBT advocates have denounced the argument. Houston Police Chief Charles McClelland said in a press briefing this month that such behaviors would remain illegal if voters uphold the law. The claim appears to stem the fact that banning discrimination based on gender identity one of about a dozen characteristics covered by the law in places of public accommodation allows transgender women to use womens restrooms. As such, the group seems to argue, these women are actually perverted men who threaten girls safety. Campaign finance reports show Campaign for Houston, the leading city-based group attempting to repeal the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, has raised $337,270. Other corporate donors include Trinity Equity Partners, which also tossed in $5,000, and the Education Valet, which gave $250. Bob McNair, owner of the NFL team the Houston Texans, gave $10,000 to but withdrew the contribution after the campaign attributed ideas to him that he disagreed with such as ideas about attracting the Super Bowl and keeping restrooms safe. Dwarfing that sum, the campaign to uphold the law, Houston Unites, reported Monday it had banked nearly $3 million. Neither Campaign for Houston nor Texas Outhouse replied to requests from BuzzFeed News to comment on factual basis for the ads or the financial contribution. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Tara Hudsons mother said: I just want to get my daughter into a safe, female environment where she belongs. View this image  Change.org Hudson is a makeup artist who has had six years of gender reassignment surgery and has lived as a woman for her entire adult life. She was sentenced to 12 weeks in the mens jail HM Bristol after she pleaded guilty to an assault on Boxing Day in 2014. View this image  Change.org A Change.org petition calling for Hudson to be moved has been signed by thousands of people. The petition description says people like Hudson are paying a high price at the hands of an outdated judicial system, simply for being who they are. One of the campaigners, Ceri Jenkins, said she created the petition so Hudson didnt feel alone and knew people were in her corner. Trans and other LGBT (lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, transgender) people are fighting a constant battle against oppressive systems and ideologies, and this can be so exhausting and disheartening, she said. They need allies to step up to the plate, to help raise their voices, and to lift them to a place where they can be heard for themselves. Via Change.org Via Change.org I dont think she will cope well at all, Brooklyn told the Bath Chronicle. I just feel the men are going to go after her. Its going to be humiliating. I just want to get my daughter into a safe, female environment where she belongs and will continue to fight the decision. Ruth Hunt, chief executive of the LGBT charity Stonewall, described the decision to put Hudson in an all-male prison, despite her identifying as female, as extremely concerning. Taras safety must come first, and this decision puts her at risk, Hunt said. The treatment of trans people in the prison service is one that needs careful review, and while its encouraging that the current women and equalities select committee inquiry is looking into this, something must be done now to ensure that Tara is safe and protected in her environment. On Monday evening, a spokesperson from the prison service said a person needs a gender recognition certificate to change prison. They added that it is longstanding policy to place offenders according to their legally recognised gender, and that strict rules are in place to ensure transsexual prisoners are managed safely and in accordance with the law. 7.

aS"The State Department denied Dana Zzyyms request to list their gender as X on their passport application. Now Zzyym is suing. View this image  Dana Zzym. Via lambdalegal.org Dana Zzyym has spent most of their life struggling to conform to social and legal categories of gender. But now Zzyym is claiming the State Department violated their constitutional rights when it denied them a U.S. passport last year for failing to pick either a male or female gender box. Lambda Legal, an LGBT civil rights group, filed a lawsuit Monday on Zzyyms behalf claiming that the State Department and Colorado Passport Agency locked Dana within the confines of our nations borders with no legal means to depart the United States because it does not recognize gender identity beyond male and female. The suit said the State Department violated the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, which guarantees that no one be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which protects people from discrimination based on sex. The department discriminated against Zzyym in this case by denying them a passport with a gender marker other than M or F, which is a sex-based consideration, the lawsuit argues. This then denied Zzyyms right to freely travel, which is a right given to other people who identify as either male or female, they argue. The U.S. government is forcing individuals who are neither male or female from accurately being able to affirm their identity, said Lambda Legal staff attorney Paul Castillo told BuzzFeed News. So theyre telling Dana they have to choose between who they are and their ability to travel, but they shouldnt have to choose. The State Department denied Zzyyms request because it requires the sex field to be listed as either M or F, according to the complaint. It later denied Zzyyms request that the department review its decision to deny their request to be listed as X, saying in a letter in April that the decision was final, according to court documents. Zzyym, 57, was born with ambiguous genitalia. Zzyms parents listed their gender as blank on the birth certificate as Zzym underwent painful and irreversible surgeries to pass as male. Despite the medical treatment, the family was silent on the issue. My parents never talked about it, said Zzyym. I had to discover it on my own. Over four decades, Zzyym, a Navy veteran, fought to understand their gender in a world that required them to choose between either male or female. They experimented with a female gender at one point, even undergoing surgery to have female genitalia, and legally changed their name from Brian Orin Whitney to Dana Alix Zzyym. By 2011 Zzyym came to terms with being intersex. In 2012 Zzyym changed their birth certificate from male to unknown. View this image  U.S. State Department Since then, Zzyym has worked as an intersex activist through their role as associate director of the Organization Intersex Internationals U.S. affiliate, one of the worlds leading intersex advocacy groups. In 2014, they were invited to an international LGBTI conference in Mexico City to represent their organization chapter. Zzyym drove to their nearest passport agency in Denver, Colorado with their application, birth certificate, drivers license, photo, fee, and letter explaining that they are neither male or female. Instead, they asked to use X as the marker in the sex field of the passport. The State Department declined to comment to BuzzFeed News because the lawsuit is pending. The department recently started to accept passport applications from transgender travelers who have not undergone sexual reassignment surgery. But the question of a gender option for intersex people still remains open. Castillo says that the lawsuit raises the question of whether gender should continue to be required to confirm someones identity. Zzyym gave the State Department other materials including their birth certificate and documentation from the Veterans Affairs office, which Castillo says could have been used to verify Zzyyms identity. The department has other mechanisms at hand to confirm a travelers identity, including the United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization standards for machine-readable travel documents which accepts an X gender mark. Foreign nationals who have the X marker on their passports are permitted to enter U.S. and yet were denying the same rights to own citizens, said Castillo. When you are allowing foreign nationals more rights than you do your own citizens with respect to the same document, there has to be something wrong. Several countries issue passports with alternative gender markers to M or F, including Australia, India, Malta, Nepal, Germany and New Zealand. This is something I believe every other intersex and non binary person has a right to do, said Zzyym. This is the right thing for me to do. I think everybody is born trying to make the world a better place and this is what I need to do. Read the complaint: View this embed  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The prominent Australian-born writer and feminist believes transgender women are not women. Kane Hibberd / Getty Images Caitlyn Jenner. Kevin Winter / Getty Images Germaine Greer. In an interview with BBC2s Newsnight, Greer was asked about Caitlyn Jenner, who is rumoured to be the next Glamour Woman of the Year. I think misogyny plays a really big part in all of this, Greer said. That a man who goes to these lengths to become a woman will be a better woman than someone who is just born a woman. Greer added that she thinks Jenner was chasing the attention enjoyed by the other Kardashian women by transitioning. It seems to me that what was going on there, is that he, she, wanted the limelight that the other female members of the family are enjoying, and has conquered it just like that. View this image  Germaine Greer. Gaye Gerard / Getty Images The petition was organised by Rachael Melhuish, the Womens Officer at Cardiff Universitys student union. Melhuish wrote that Greer has demonstrated time and time again her misogynistic views towards trans women, including continually misgendering trans women and denying the existence of transphobia altogether. The petition goes on to say hosting a speaker with such problematic and hateful views towards marginalised and vulnerable groups is dangerous, and urges Cardiff University to cancel the event. I was going to talk about women and power, the lessons of the 20th century, Greer told BBC2. Apparently people have decided that because I dont think post operative transgender menare women, I am not to be allowed to talk. I am not saying that people should not be allowed to go through that procedure, she added. What I am saying is that it doesnt make them a woman. It happens to be an opinion. Its not a prohibition.

aS"Facing harsh criticism, Bob McNair canceled the check last week, a source familiar with the situation told BuzzFeed News. View this image  Houston Texans owner Bob McNair. AP / Dave Einsel NFL team owner Bob McNair took back a $10,000 donation last week from a campaign to repeal Houstons nondiscrimination law after the group attributed statements to him that he doesnt believe in. To my great dismay, Campaign for Houston made numerous unauthorized statements about my opposition to HERO in print, broadcast, and social media including attributing certain statements of belief to me, the Houston Texans owner said in a statement Friday after he suffered a week of scorching criticism over the gift. Their actions and statements were never discussed with nor approved by me, he continued. Therefore I instructed the campaign to return my contribution. A source familiar with the situation told BuzzFeed News that McNair canceled the check last week before it was deposited. Campaign for Houston and its spokesman, Jared Woodfill, have focused their talking points, mailers, and commercials predominately on stoking fear that transgender sex predators will use the law to prowl womens restrooms and attack young girls. Facebook posts and other statements have said that was McNairs motivation for contributing: Facebook: jaredwoodfill Facebook: CampaignForHouston The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, which goes before voters in a ballot referendum on Nov. 3, makes it illegal to discriminate against a wide array of people in places of housing, employment, and public accommodations. Houston officials have said the law would not change the laws against predatory behavior in bathrooms. Neither Campaign for Houston nor Woodfill replied to requests for comment from BuzzFeed News. McNairs statement said that while he believes a thoughtful rewrite would provide a better ordinance, he ultimately supports strong non-discrimination protections for all Houstonians. But Campaign for Houston, which is trying to repeal the law, broadcast that donation as of blessing of the campaigns messages. Criticism was harsh over McNairs contribution. A Forbes article was titled, Bob McNair Should Face Repercussions for Shameful Donation To Anti-Gay Group. And Chris Kluwe, a former player for the Vikings, said in an open letter that McNairs donation funded a cause whose sole purpose is to denigrate a specific group of American citizens. Kluwe asked McNair: Why does the idea of LBGT individuals enjoying the same rights and protections as everyone else fill you with such hatred, such loathing, that you would voluntarily choose to make their lives even more difficult than the prejudice theyve faced for decades? Advocates for the nondiscrimination law have also warned repealing the ordinance could risk the citys ability to host the Super Bowl. But Woodfill told Fox26 that McNairs donation was a comment on that issue, saying the contribution should send a very loud, a very clear message to anyone who would try to scare people based on these bogus Super Bowl-type arguments. McNairs statement ended by trying to quiet some of his critics. I do not believe in or tolerate personal or professional discrimination of any kind, he wrote. I also believe that we Houstonians should have an ordinance that unites our community and provides a bold statement of non-discrimination. I encourage all Houstonians to vote on November 3.

aS"From stand-up comedy to Broadway to Orange is the New Black, shes basically done it all. Youve seen Lea DeLaria as the hilarious, shit-talking, screwdriver-wielding Big Boo in Orange is the New Black but did you know that DeLaria has been making major waves on stage and screen for over thirty years? The comic, jazz musician, and Broadway veteran a true triple threat stopped by BuzzFeed News to walk us through her career milestones, including her unyielding commitment to LGBT activism. Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News I was the first openly gay comic on television, period, in America late night or daytime. I was the first. I walked out and said, Hello everybody, its the 1990s, its hip to be queer and Im a biiiiiiig dyke. I knew I was going to do that because I was doing similar stand-up at the time. I launched into different things that were happening socially around queers in the media. But right before I went on that night, I was terrified! That show was seen all over the world, not just America. And I was getting reports that apparently all these gay bars in LA and New York were watching, because they knew I was going to be on. I thought, Thisll be the one time Im gonna fucking bomb. Im gonna walk out and say Its hip to be queer and Im a big dyke and theres gonna be crickets, crickets, crickets. But instead, it was cheers. It was shocking to me because we hadnt packed the audience, we hadnt done anything, but we just got the right audience, and they screamed at everything I said. I had to cut a couple jokes because the laughs were so long. It was awesome. Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News When I got started in San Francisco in 1982, I was filled with rage. Let me be clear: I wasnt angry, I was rageful. Cause anger is a shitty little emotion. With rage, you can get stuff done. I was bald, I wore safety pins, I had big boots and tight tight pants. I was very punk at the time, just done and over it. I remember looking at Holly Near, which was a big lesbian thing at the time, and thinking this is the end of the fucking world, why is anyone listening to this shit? And that was basically what my comments and comedy were about: lesbian culture at the time. I called myself the Fuckin Dyke. I wasnt even Lea DeLaria. I wasnt Lea DeLaria for the first two years as a comic. I was the Fuckin Dyke. It was like a persona. Theyd say Welcome to the stage, the Fuckin Dyke. In 1982 in San Francisco, I couldnt walk down the street without someone yelling fucking dyke at me. I thought if theyre gonna call me that, why not call myself that? I was really popular. I started [doing stand-up] in April 1982, and by September of the same year, I quit my day job I had been working as a carpenter with an all gay construction crew and was supporting myself solely as a stand-up comic. A year and a half after that, I had to start going by my own name, because honestly, everywhere I went in San Francisco Id be walking down the street, and people would drive by in their cars and theyd scream You fucking dyke! and I didnt know if they were a fan. Id be with my girlfriends mother, and someone would scream fucking dyke. I had to go, Im done now, Ive gotta start being Lea DeLaria. Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News I think I was very loud, very fast, wouldnt stop, in your face, boom boom boom. I think my comedy now is not its still loud, still in your face, but I think now its a little smarter, and I talk about the world at large instead of just keeping it on whats going on in queer culture. Of course Im always going to have something to say about queer culture. But as gays have become more like the raisins in Raisin Bran, as my good friend Scott Thompson (who plays Buddy Cole) says, you dont want the raisins all in one corner of the bowl. I feel like my job now is to comment more on society at large, rather than just focus on queers. Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News I am the happiest when I am downstage center belting a D sharp. Theres nothing that makes me happier. Whenever I do any kind of musical theater, whatever I do, I elicit a tremendous response from the audience. Ive played Carnegie Hall many times, and almost every time, except once, Ive stopped the show. And its really hard to do that at Carnegie Hall! I think its just that I loooove being there so much. I always say that inside this big bulldyke body beats the heart of a vicious queen. I love putting on a wig, and a dress, and heels, and just queening it up. Something about that makes me so happy. I love creating these actual real-girl characters, as much as I liked playing Eddie and Dr. Scott [in the 2000 revival of The Rocky Horror Show] that was amazing. That they let a chick play Eddie was fantastic. Singing Whatever Happened To Saturday Night, getting hacked to death with a chainsaw the audience would get so excited. I would come out, and I would look down, and Id see people grabbing their playbills, trying to figure out if I was a man or a woman. They couldnt tell! I always love telling the story of Julie Harris coming backstage, coming up to talk to Alice Ripley and I thats the other reason I love Broadway, I get to share dressing rooms with people like Alice Ripley so, she came in, and she was so charming and told me how funny I was as Dr. Scott, blah blah blah, it went on and on, and then she said Now wheres that nice young man who played Eddie? She was dead fuckin serious. Alice and I looked at each other and I said, Um, I played Eddie, it was me. She was like, What??? I was like, yes, I just fooled one of the greatest actresses. Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Theres so many. For awhile, I basically played the same character: the lesbian who inappropriately hits on straight women. I did that a lot. Will and Grace really gave me [playing] nurse Carver was ridiculous fun. I mean, it just was. As it was unfolding, they were throwing more jokes out to me, try this punchline, try this punchline. That was really fun. The other one would have to be Matlock. That was my first work as an actor on television. Andy Griffith to this day, I refer to him as my mentor. He was just a lovely and loving man, didnt give a fuck about me being gay, and he just thought I was funny, so he wanted me on the show. Suddenly I had this recurring role on Matlock with Fred Sullivan and Andy fucking Griffith. [laughs] In one of the episodes my character was very klutzy, kept spilling things on a seersucker suit that episode is in the Smithsonian, alongside that seersucker suit. So thats kind of cool. Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News I was originally on the Warner Jazz label, I had five records out with them, and Im known in the world of jazz as a weird jazz person. I dont just sing the American songbook, I dont just sing a tune that everyone knows. My first big hit in the jazz world was a swing version of The Ballad of Sweeney Todd. Everybody just went What? But it was great. For my second record, called Double Standards, I swung the college rock/alternative rock songbook. My two big hits were the smoky swing version of Blondies Call Me, that gets played all the time, and I did a really lovely jazz ballad of Neil Youngs Philadelphia, which also gets played all the time. Doing that record absolutely put me in that place where Im always looking for odd jazz. So when I was still on the label, before there was no Warner Jazz and Classics, I said itd be fun to just do covers of David Bowie songs. They were like What, why? I was like, Why? Are you fucking kidding me? First of all, when have you ever heard anyone say Oh, David Bowie, that hack? Never. The man has been making hit records since the 1960s. Were talking about five decades of people who know David Bowie. Nobody under the age of 70 does not know David Bowie. His oeuvre is insane, its incredible number one hit after number one hit, and theyre all musically so interesting. Why wouldnt I [do the record]? But then the label went under, and I got Orange is the New Black, all this stuff happened, and I checked in with my producer whos produced most of my records, and he brought up Kickstarter. I thought really, crowdfunding? Okay. And it worked. David Bowie started following me on Twitter, started putting all my stuff out. Its been kind of amazing. House of David, Bowie plus DeLaria equals jazz, you can download it anywhere you download anything. RCA Records Ghostlight Records Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Its pretty much about the entirety of my career: Dont judge a butch by its cover. I wear the butch thing very proudly, obviously, Ive got the tattoo. I live in a society thats your basic heterosexist society, but also in the queer world where being butch is looked down upon. So refusing to be invisible and I think you can apply that to almost anything is important to effect change. Its about accepting who you are, being who you are, and just putting yourself out there. Its important. People loved it that particular scene, with Boo and her father I get hundreds of DMs every day on Instagram. I dont think people realize that I look at those, but I do. I get tweets are about it, pictures, a meme started. I adopted the hashtag and I cant believe how often its been used. Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News The same thing that compelled me to be an openly dyke comic, to be proud of my butchness, to be comfortable in my own skin, and to love myself the way I do. I grew up in a very different world that we had today, and it wasnt that long ago that I grew up you have to remember that. I grew up in the 70s, and there was no one like me, ever, anywhere, period. Because Alison Bechdel [the author of Fun Home, a graphic novel-turned-musical] is of that same generation, that song Ring of Keys I just really feel that song. I remember when I saw that butch for the first time. Such a great musical. I knew that I would never be comfortable not being out. I knew that I had tools that would help effect change in the world. I could cower in the closet I try really hard not to judge other people in this. Its still really hard to be out. I hate to blame the person thats not out in a society thats a heterosexist society. Its like blaming a woman for being raped because shes wearing a sexy outfit its bullshit. But for me, it would have been cowering in the closet, trying to become famous before coming out. I couldnt ever do that, it just wasnt me. I really prefer to look at myself in the mirror every day when I brush my teeth and like myself. Being true to who I am and what I am is just a huge part of it. The activism just went hand and hand. I was out in 1982. When I started performing, they still called HIV and AIDS gay cancer. That was a very active time politically in the queer community, and I was in San Francisco, one of the hot spots. I wasnt gonna be a dyke comic and not be part of the politics, part of the things we were trying to change, you know what I mean? That was it. After Arsenio Hall, that thrust me into world politics. I toured anywhere that spoke English, and a lot of places had never seen anything like that. So, yeah, once I was thrust into that world, please, why wouldnt I? Plus, its a great way to get laid, lets be honest. I get a lot of pussy, always have.

aS"In an apparently unprecedented move, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo plans to use his executive authority to ban discrimination against transgender people in housing, employment, and public accommodations statewide. View this image  Gov. Andrew Cuomo walks in an LGBT pride march in New York City in 2011. AP / Diane Bondareff Making an end-run around a legislature paralyzed on the issue, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo plans to use his executive authority to ban discrimination against transgender people in housing, employment, credit education, and public accommodations statewide. Currently, the state prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. But after the legislature failed several times to pass a bill protecting transgender New Yorkers, the governor decided to take the apparently unprecedented step of invoking his executive powers on the matter, an administration official said. In a formal announcement about his strategy to extend protections to all LGBT people, Cuomo is scheduled address the Empire State Pride Agenda at an event Thursday evening. An administration official familiar with planning process told BuzzFeed News that the governor convened key staff this summer to explore ways to implement new rules himself. Lawyers in the governors office found that under Executive Law 2995, the New York State Division of Human Rights has the authority to promulgate regulations of the states Human Rights Law, the administration official said. The proposed regulations, which the governors office will soon enter into the state registry for a 45-day comment period, would expand definitions of sex and disability discrimination to include gender identity, gender expression, and gender dysphoria. Although the Human Rights Law as passed by the state legislature would not itself be amended, the new additions that apply to the law would grant the New York State Division of Human Rights power to enforce the regulations with the force of law. New York passed the Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Act which barred discrimination against gays, lesbians, and bisexuals in 1990. However, efforts to expand on that statute to cover the full LGBT community have faltered. Eight times, the state Assembly passed the Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act (GENDA), most recently in June, but the Senate failed to pass the measure. Cuomo, who has long been a champion for LGBT rights, including marriage equality, wanted to right what he saw as a historic wrong against transgender people, said the administration official. The official added that Cuomo and his staff are not aware of any other state where a governor has used executive authority to grant similar protections. In a statement released before the governors announcement, Nathan Schaefer, executive director of the Empire State Pride Agenda, said, We look forward to working with the Administration to quickly implement these regulations so transgender New Yorkers are protected from discrimination a basic civil right that is long overdue.

aS"Spoiler alert: Everyone said yes. View this image  As a lady who dates other ladies, one of the most common (and surprising) relationship questions Im asked is Who proposes? Of course assuming you want to get married there are no rules or script. Thats precisely what makes it all so much fun! We asked queer couples to share their own proposal stories to see how they each made this age-old tradition their own. After all, everyone loves a good proposal story. View this image  Lauren still remembers the very first time she saw her future wife, Christina, at the University of Houston. I saw this bubbly, beautiful, curly-headed brown girl in a long coral peasant skirt and glasses flitting about the room. I didnt know who she was, I just knew I wanted to be near her, Lauren told BuzzFeed. For Christina, the meeting was just as memorable. It was just like when Beyonc shows up on stage before she begins a performance where everything around you goes silent and all you can see is her. Popping the question:  For their fifth anniversary, the couple decided to celebrate with a special photo shoot. Lauren had no clue that during the session Christina planned to pop the question. I wanted to promise to Lauren I would strive to be a better partner every day. It was a natural progression in our relationship and I wanted her to have a symbol of my promise. I was so nervous I didnt tell anyone I was proposing not even my mom, said Christina. On my way to the photo shoot, I had to pull over on the highway to call and ask for my moms blessing. With mothers approval and a shot of whiskey from her flask Christina was ready for the big moment. tarabethphotography.com / Via onabicyclebuiltfortwo.com Lauren described the moment from her perspective: Toward the end of the photo shoot, Christina pulled out a present. I immediately began to scold her for breaking the rules and getting me another present. Besides, I didnt get her anything! So, disgruntled, I opened the box, and there was another smaller box inside. Thats when she started to propose. I was like, Wait, what?! What are you saying? What does this mean? Then, of course, I started crying. She actually stopped mid-proposal to hold my hand and kiss my cheek. Im so lucky to be marrying my best friend. tarabethphotography.com / Via onabicyclebuiltfortwo.com tarabethphotography.com / Via onabicyclebuiltfortwo.com View this image  Lauren and Andie first met when they joined the same radical street band in Brooklyn. Lauren played the sax and Andie danced. After nine months of avoiding eye contact, Andie eventually told a mutual friend she thought Lauren was hot. Lauren said I love you on their sixth date. Popping the question:  We always knew there would be a double proposal, but hetero gender stereotypes falsely led Lauren to assume that her butch-self would be first to propose, the couple told BuzzFeed. Andie ended up getting the jump on Lauren and proposed during a very financially irresponsible trip to Spain. The proposal itself went horribly wrong and involved canceled hotel reservations, an onslaught of rain, surprise periods, tragic leg wounds, and no vegetarian food for the two vegetarians. We want to go through the motions of ritualizing the importance of this relationship but hated saying that marriage, in its contemporary essence, was the way to do that, added Andie. So we found language that felt right and then Lauren prepped her proposal a few months later. gowestphoto.com Laurens proposal took place at the Hope Outdoor Gallery in Austin, where the couple lives. Andie was under the assumption they were off to get an oil change while Lauren subtly shaved a diamond ring into her head at the last minute. Andie said yes, and the night continued with friends from out of town, pink limos, a queer dance party, and some sloppy drinking. Next summer the newly engaged duo are having a talent show wedding at Laurens alma matter, Mills College. We have built our social relationships on our love of making our friends perform for us. Why would our wedding be any different? View this image  View on Instagram Kellie approached Christina in a Philly night club nine years ago. After a night of dancing and an exchange of numbers, the rest is history. Weve been in each others lives ever since, said Christina. Popping the question: Kellie planned a surprise proposal on Christinas 27th birthday. She would ask during a birthday brunch with all their closest friends and family in attendance. I prepared a few party games and one involved a short story I wrote where everyone picked a line from a hat and as the lines were read, if you heard yours youd go stand by the gift bag, replacing the previous person. The last person standing by the gift bag won, said Christina. She didnt think anything was going on when Kellie handed her a line as the game began. View on Instagram When the story stopped at me I was surprised by how quickly everyone tried to give the bag away! Everyone shouted Look in the bag! Inside the box was a note that Christina was instructed to read aloud and a small box. To be honest, all I remember reading was the word wife and I freaked out! [Kellie] got on her knee and asked me to marry her and of course I said yes! said Christina. She even had a videographer who totally tricked me into thinking she was just taking pictures! I love being able to watch it over and over again. View this image  View this image  Natasha and Liz circled in the same group of friends for nearly 15 years before finally being introduced in 2011. I like to tell people that we fell for one another over our mutual passion for music, Liz told BuzzFeed. Popping the question:  A former mariachi performer, Natasha planned to serenade Liz in full mariachi attire at a friends BBQ. There in front of all of our closest friends and family they played our favorite song, Si Nos Dejan, said Liz. She added that the song title translates to If They Let Us, a slightly ironic choice. Natasha would later admit that out of the hundreds of times she had performed the song, this was the only time she was so nervous she wasnt able to play her guitar. Instead, she immediately put her guitar down and pulled out a box with the ring and asked me to marry her, said Liz. View this image  Liz had originally planned to propose that same month, but when Natasha beat her to it she pushed her plans back a few weeks to keep the element of surprise. Lizs proposal was the exact opposite of her girlfriends Mariachi proposal a small, intimate moment before bed. We were laying in bed talking about our perfect wedding dreams. I stopped mid sentence and reached into my nightstand and opened the box containing her ring. The little light in the box literally Iit up the room and all I could see was her gorgeous smile.

I had actually seen her at a different bar earlier in the night, but didnt say or do anything, Alli told BuzzFeed. When we did finally meet, we exchanged numbers. Two days later we had our first date on Jesss actual birthday. That was over five years ago, but just three weeks ago the couple tied the knot in Columbus. Popping the question: The proposal itself took place at a friends house during game night in November 2014. Jess was the one to ask. Unbeknownst to me, she had gone to a special jeweler to have my ring custom-made using photos provided by my mom of my great-grandmothers ring, Alli explained. View this image  After a few rounds of charades, a two-player topic came up and Jess pulled her girlfriend up to participate. She got down on one knee and I thought it was a joke, noted Alli, who happily said yes once she realized what was going on. I was completely surprised. I did not propose back, but we did go out and get her a ring that would also double as her wedding band. amyannphoto.com / Via onabicyclebuiltfortwo.com amyannphoto.com / Via onabicyclebuiltfortwo.com View this image  Heather and Sandy graduated from high school in the same class, but never knew the other existed. We still joke to this day that she actually knew who I was because I played sports, however I had no idea who she was, explained Sandy. They would meet 10 years later at a happy hour. Heather and I hit it off and we ended up spending the entire night talking and before you know it everyone had left and we were the only ones left, chatting and playing darts together. The couple now lives in Laurel, Maryland, the same town they went to high school in. View this image  Popping the question:  When I knew that Heather was the one I wanted to spend my life with, I knew exactly how I wanted to propose to her, said Sandy. Im a huge picture person. I feel as though you can relive a moment in time when simply looking at a picture. I never wanted to forget the look on her face when I asked her to be my wife and I felt the only way to capture that look was to have a picture of it. Sandy got in touch with a photographer and came up with the plan: a Valentines Day photo session scheduled exactly three years after the day they first met. Heather didnt see anything coming. We knew we were ready for that step in our relationship. However, once I was ready to pop the question I stopped talking to her about it so that she wouldnt get suspicious, said Sandy. And there was no proposing back either. Once I proposed we looked at it as if we were engaged; it didnt matter who proposed. We were ready for the next adventure in our life together and started to plan our wedding.

Meredith sent the initial message over OkCupid but, to her disappointment, never heard back. A few weeks later, as if by fate, they bumped into each other at a bar. What can I say, I love a woman with an accent, said Meredith. Popping the question: I always thought I would be the one in the relationship to pop the question, but she beat me to it, said Meredith of the evening Shoshana proposed. Meredith was under the impression it was just another date night in London. Little did I know that Shoshana had coordinated with the restaurant and wrote an extra special Specials Menu where she asked me to marry her. FYI: They have a very beautiful wedding video.

I didnt think what I was looking for in a woman was in Indiana, Kylee explained. But the more they hung out, the more the two women realized there was something real between them. LeAnn and her son moved in after us dating for six months and we started our life as a family together. Popping the question: Kylee was the one to take action a little over a year into their relationship. With LeAnn being the most romantic person on the planet, I knew I had to do something special for our day. Kylee planned to ask on their one-year anniversary over dinner at their favorite restaurant. For dessert the waiter brought out an old card LeAnn had written for Kylee, telling her all the reasons she loved her. Cohen, LeAnns son, was also in on the surprise. Cohen walked up to the table with a shirt I had made that said say yes and brought the ring over to the table for me. View this image  LeAnn also wanted to do something special for Kylee her own proposal. Kylee remembers the special night from her perspective: We live in front of a beautiful wooded area with trails. After taking her to dinner we went on a walk in the woods. We came up to a candlelit path where one of my best friends was playing my favorite song on the guitar, All of Me by John Legend. You would have thought this was our first engagement with how emotional I was. View this image  View this image  Ashtin and Theresa met the usual way, as X-ray technologists in British Colombia. OK, maybe not so usual. Early on in their relationship, Ashtin made it clear that Theresa was not allowed to propose because, well, she wanted to be the one to do it. Somewhere along the line she let it slip that she thought it would be cool if I were the one to propose, Theresa explained. Popping the question:  Theresa prepped for the big moment with a little help from Pinterest, creating a board with ideas to be included on it. She laid out a plan to propose to her girlfriend after a romantic stroll that would end with a dock picnic overlooking the lake in Prince George. Everything was perfect. Everything went wrong. It was so miserable outside that I couldnt just suggest a walk in the forest. I cant say, Hey, I know its raining sideways but wanna go for a walk? Yet, somehow, Theresa convinced her girlfriend to play along. Courtesy Ashtin and Theresa The pinterest planning board I remember saying, Theresa, I am loving you a little less with every step right now, Ashtin told BuzzFeed. With the wind and rain howling, Theresa just barely managed to get the question out. I asked for both of her hands and said, I love you more than anything, and I would love to spend the rest of my life with you. I got down on one knee and said Will you marry me? Ashtin said yes. In the beginning it seemed like the whole day was a mess and would never end the way I had imagined, but it turned out to be a fantastic story, said Theresa. The chaos of it is so very much us. Im not sure why I imagined everything would go smoothly. View this image  View this image  The first time Charlyn and Emily met, it was only because Charlyn sat in the wrong section of their Class of 2009 freshman photo right next to Emily. They would later join the same sorority and continue to have small instances of being in the right place at the right time. It was almost as if these paths were paved to bring our relationship closer and stronger, said Charlyn. Popping the question:  Both of them planned to propose to each other on a trip to Disneyland. A close friend played along, hiding both the rings and not alerting the couple to what was really going on. We asked both Emily and Charlyn to describe their respective proposals: Emily: I decided to get a caricature drawn of us before the big question. Afterwards, I spotted an outdoor bar right in the center of Downtown Disney. She ordered a beer, and of course, to calm my nerves, I ordered a mixed beverage. She was confessing how happy she was that I was there with her family that she wanted to capture the moment, so she reached around for her phone and snapped a photo of us. Immediately after, I distracted her attention towards the vines going up a light fixture so that she would turn away and at that exact secondI reached into my pocket and pulled out the ring box. I was able to open it and set it down right in front of her before she turned around, As soon as she saw it her mouth dropped she was speechless. My heart was racing, but I did it, and now I have the perfect fianc. Afterwards, we just had to get a caricature as a newly engaged couple. Charlyn: I wanted the proposal to go along with Disney, and the Disney movie Up had meaning to us both. Once I decided to make our own version, everything fell into its place. I did research, and figured that I wanted to propose during the California Adventure water show, World of Color, during the Up scene the timing had to be perfect. Before our trip, I created a journal that holds every true feeling I have for her, and with leather strings, I intertwined the ring so that it held as a bookmark to where its written, Marry me. I held our Adventure Book, for what felt like an eternity. As soon as the piano started to play the Up tune and balloons started to appear, I turned around and handed her the book. I kept it hidden inside my sweatshirt the entire show up until then. I told her that she was the one I wanted to spend my life with and that I couldnt wait to start our own adventure together. With Aladdins A Whole New World in the background, we held each other, crying, as the happiest couple in the entire world. We both had rings now, and the rest of our vacation was bliss!

aS'I never got to be proud of what I did in Sochi because I felt so horrible about what I didnt do. View this image  Kenworthy recently completed the 201415 season as the Association of Freeski Professionals overall champion for the fifth year in a row. View this image  I am gay. Wow, it feels good to write those words. For most of my life Ive been afraid to embrace that truth about myself. Recently though, Ive gotten to the point where the pain of holding onto the lie is greater than the fear of letting go, and Im proud to finally be letting my guard down. My sexuality has been something Ive struggled to come to terms with. Ive known I was gay since I was a kid but growing up in a town of 2,000 people, a class of 48 kids and then turning pro as an athlete when I was 16, it just wasnt something I wanted to accept. I pushed my feelings away in the hopes that it was a passing phase but the thought of being found out kept me up at night. I constantly felt anxious, depressed and even suicidal. Tom Pennington / Getty Images espn.go.com Looking back, its crazy to see how far Ive come. For most of my life Ive dreaded the day that people would find out I was gay. Now, I couldnt be more excited to tell you all the truth. Whether youve suspected it all along or its a complete shock, its important for me to be open and honest with you all. Yall have supported me through a lot of my highs and lows and I hope youll stay by my side as I make this transformation into the genuine me - the me that Ive always really been. I am so thankful to @ESPN for giving me this opportunity and to Alyssa Roenigk for telling my story to the world. I think about the pain I put myself through by closeting myself for so long and it breaks my heart. If only I knew then what I know now: that the people who love you, who really care about you, will be by your side no matter what; and, that those who arent accepting of you are not the people you want or need in your life anyway. Part of the reason I had such a difficult time as a kid was that I didnt know anyone in my position and didnt have someone to look up to, whos footsteps I could follow in. I hope to be that person for a younger generation, to model honesty and transparency and to show people that theres nothing cooler than being yourself and embracing the things that make you unique. Click the link in my bio to read the full story and keep your eyes peeled for the Nov issue on newsstands soon! Today is the first day of the rest of my life. Just watched my story air on @ESPN @SportsCenter and I\'m all choked up. Tears of joy!

aS"Growing up, no one taught me what being Filipino-American meant. So, naturally, I studied. I cant remember the exact moment I first realized I was Filipino-American. It was just part of who I was. Perhaps it was because I grew up in a large Filipino-American community in the San Francisco Bay Area. Within a 20-mile radius were my 17 first cousins (and about 70 extended cousins who I may or may not have been actually related to). My earliest childhood memories involved running around cousins houses, while the titos played mahjong or pusoy dos in a smoke-filled garage or basement. The dining room or kitchen always had a tableful of your basic staples: rice, chicken adobo, spaghetti with hot dog chunks, and pancit. My high school was about 40% Filipino, and most of my friends were Filipino too. At our high school proms, we crammed 50 Filipinos into one group picture, just so we could have wallet-size photos to hand out to our friends. We wore Filipino Pride T-shirts and sang along to Jocelyn Enriquez songs on the radio. We could name all the famous Filipinos on TV and movies, mostly because there were so few of them. There was Lea Salonga, Nia Peeples, Tia Carrere, Lou Diamond Phillips, and Rob Schneider from Saturday Night Live. Anyone with one drop of Filipino blood was considered family or someone to be proud of. Despite this, we didnt really know much about what it meant to be Filipino-American. Only a few of my friends spoke Tagalog or another Filipino dialect; the rest of us spoke only English. And none of us were knowledgeable about Philippine or Filipino-American history. Although half of my classmates looked like me, our teachers didnt seem to acknowledge the diversity of our school, even though it was something many students talked about. We did have Culture Week once a year: We were encouraged to wear our native garb to school, and student groups performed their cultural dances during afternoon assemblies. But for every other week of the school year, our classes focused on white American perspectives and histories. Instead of Jose Rizal or Jessica Hagedorn, we had Charles Dickens or Jane Austen. Instead of lessons about the Philippine-American War or the Bataan Death March, we had lessons about the Spanish Inquisition or the French Revolution. Given that the Philippines was an American colony for almost 50 years, it was baffling that nothing Filipino-related was ever mentioned in any part of the curriculum. We had only one Filipino teacher in our entire school, an American-born Pinay in her late twenties. Ironically, she taught my world history class. The standardized curriculum she used primarily focused on what were considered the most important events in world history: the history of Europe. Even though she identified as Filipino-American, she couldnt devote even one days lesson to the history of the Philippines. The message we got was that our parents homeland was not important enough for us to study at least not during school hours. At home, my immigrant parents didnt talk much about being Filipino. At home, my immigrant parents didnt talk much about being Filipino. Both my parents were the first in their families to emigrate (my mom in 1965, my dad in 1969), in search of opportunities for their then-hypothetical children. They said goodbye to their parents, siblings, and friends, not knowing if they would ever see them again. They made a new life in California with the help of a few older relatives (who arrived decades prior and worked as farmworkers and laborers) and each other. When I was a teenager, my parents told me about the hardships they experienced when they first arrived in the U.S. While they were promised opportunities and open arms, they were actually greeted by racism and ignorance. My mom, a nurse, regularly encountered World War II military veteran patients who said horrific things to her because they assumed she was Japanese. They called her a Jap and an Oriental. Patients refused my mothers care because they thought she was the enemy. When shed say she was Filipino, the veterans usually relaxed, since they believed Filipinos were American allies and sometimes even the little brown brothers of the U.S. My dad, on the other hand, tried not to acknowledge racism at all. He believed no one should have the right to treat him as inferior or as a second-class citizen because he had a college education. Whenever someone assumed he didnt speak English well, my dad would reply with his version of a perfect American accent, having learned English as a child in the Philippines. As a teenager, my experiences were varied. Some saw me and my peers as model minorities ambitious children of hardworking Asian parents who knew the importance of education. I knew many non-Filipino adults who enjoyed talking to my parents, because they spoke English fluently. However, many of my classmates made fun of my parents thankfully, only to me because of their heavy accents. Others considered me a troublemaker. Ive been pulled over or harassed by police officers for no reason. Security or store clerks regularly followed my friends and me around in stores or malls. At school, a few teachers and counselors stereotyped the Filipino students as gangsters and did not encourage us to our full potential. I remember a high school counselor telling me I shouldnt take certain honors classes because he didnt think Id do well in them. He later insisted I should go to a community college. It wasnt until I went to college at University of California at Irvine that I started to really develop my Filipino-American identity. My campus was 60% Asian-American and about one out of every eight students on my campus were Filipino. I joined and later became president of Kababayan, the Filipino-American student organization, 600 members strong. I danced the tinikling and singkil in our Pilipino Cultural Nights, and we sang the Philippine National Anthem at weekly meetings. And I finally read Rizal and Hagedorn and learned about the Bataan Death March. In my Filipino-American Studies class, I learned that Filipino farmworkers like Larry Itliong and Philip Vera Cruz led the Delano Grape Strikes of 1965, one of the greatest labor movements in U.S. history. In my Asian-American Psychology class, I learned about the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965, which put an end to immigration quotas and allowed for the influx of Asian immigrants like my parents to migrate to the U.S. I was in college when I learned that October was Filipino-American History Month (FAHM). FAHM was originally founded by Fred and Dorothy Cordova and the Filipino American National Historical Society in 1988, and October was chosen to commemorate the first Filipinos who landed in the Americas: a small group of Filipino seafarers and servants who jumped ship en route to Spain. They landed in what is now known as Morro Bay in California in October 1587, decades before the Pilgrims would land on Plymouth Rock. For the next 20 years, many states, like California and Michigan, and cities, like New York and Chicago, recognized the month with official proclamations. In 2009, the U.S. Congress and House of Representatives passed resolutions that officially recognized the month. And this past year, the White House hosted its very first FAHM celebration, as President Obama acknowledged that Filipino-Americans have helped expand our Nations promise throughout every aspect of our society. I celebrated FAHM every year in college, so I was disheartened when I enrolled at Michigan State University to pursue my masters degree and discovered that no one celebrated the month. I became the adviser to the small, but growing, Filipino-American student organization there, and it was through these students I learned even more about my Filipino-American identity. Because Id never had any Filipino-American professors, I wanted to become one. None of these students had similar experiences to mine. They were usually the only Filipino kid in their high schools (and sometimes the only one in their respective towns). By meeting them, I began to appreciate all the resources I had. It was then when I also realized I wanted to become a professor, so I could educate others about Filipino-Americans and other marginalized groups. I wanted to encourage young people to understand and get in touch with their own cultural heritages and identities. Because Id never had any Filipino-American professors, I wanted to become one. When I was accepted into a doctoral program in counseling psychology at Columbia University, I made it a point to study everything related to multicultural issues in psychology. I focused on how Filipino-American culture and identity affect peoples mental health. There was little research on the topic, so I wanted to be the person to change that. While there were books on black psychology, Latino psychology, and Asian-American psychology, I wanted to write the first book on Filipino-American psychology (and I later did). View this image  Will Varner / Via BuzzFeed Ten years later, Ive learned a lot about being Filipino-American. Ive discovered that Filipinos are the second-largest Asian-American group (just after Chinese-Americans) and are the second-largest immigrant population (just after Mexican-Americans). Ive also learned about the issues affecting our community, like the fact that American-born Filipinos dont go to college or graduate school as much as their immigrant counterparts, or that Filipinos tend to have higher rates of depression than other Asian-Americans and the general population, yet are less likely to seek mental health treatment. Perhaps Filipino-Americans dont attend college or graduate school because they are stereotyped or discouraged by their teachers and counselors, paralleling what my friends and I experienced in high school. Perhaps Filipino-Americans have higher levels of depression and seek mental health help less often because, much like how my parents taught me how to deal with discrimination, we try to not talk about our hardships or negative life experiences. Ive also learned that, because the Philippines has a unique colonial history, its hard for people to place us racially. We Filipinos have brown skin like other Southeast Asians and Pacific Islanders; some are even misidentified as black. Because of Spanish colonization, we tend to have Spanish last names and majority of us are (or at least were raised) Catholic, so were sometimes mistaken for Latinos. The U.S. also colonized the Philippines for almost 50 years, so most Filipinos, including those in the Philippines, are fluent in English. Perhaps this is why Filipino-Americans experience so many different types of microaggressions. In my research, Ive found that Filipino-Americans deal with microaggressions similar to those experienced by other Asian-American groups, like being stereotyped as exotic, a model minority, or a perpetual foreigner. However, Filipino-Americans also encounter microaggressions often encountered by African-Americans and Latinos, like being assumed to be dangerous or intellectually inferior. Ive also studied how concepts like colonial mentality and ethnic identity affect mental health. Colonial mentality is the idea that people from colonized places tend to view values and standards of beauty of the colonizer as good, while viewing those of the indigenous as being bad. For instance, Filipinos tend to view those with light skin as more beautiful or attractive, and those who speak English without Filipino accents as smarter or more sophisticated. Perhaps this is the reason why so many Filipino-Americans, including me, were never taught by our parents to speak their native language. In retrospect, the one thing of which I am constantly reminded is that Filipino-Americans are a resilient people. Throughout our history in both the Philippines and the U.S., we have overcome these instances of tyranny, brutality, and inequality. We have fought for independence in the Philippines and marched for civil rights in the U.S. We have organized movements, formed coalitions with allies, and persevered against systemic discrimination, ignorance, and oppression. We have comforted each other in times of despair and have supported the trailblazers who have represented us well. We have moved forward and persevered, usually with a smile, and always holding the hands of future generations behind us. *** Kevin Nadal, Ph.D. is a professor at the City University of New York, the Executive Director of CLAGS: The Center for LGBTQ Studies, the President of the Asian American Psychological Association, and a National Trustee of the Filipino American National Historical Society.

aS"Theres been a groundswell of LGBT storylines in comics over the past few decades, but gay superhero narratives havent quite made it to the big screen and thats a huge problem, because queer people deserve to see ourselves doing the impossible, too. View this image  Michelle Rial / BuzzFeed News I was obsessed with Greek mythology when I was in middle school. Still am, really. (A lot of this had to do with the 1997 release of Disneys Hercules.) For months, I made frequent trips to the library to chip away at every book under Dewey Decimal call number 753: Symbolism, Allegory, Mythology, Legend. When I was a preteen, mythology was my sacred text. I was raised Baptist but craved worship elsewhere. And in the far corner couch of a library in suburban Illinois, I worshipped. I learned how the arc of a narrative works, and I learned how the planets got their names. I learned that gods, too, could make mistakes, and that falling in love sometimes led to your untimely death. But theres one thing in Greek mythology Im indebted to now in particular. I was on my go-to couch at the library reading the Apollo section of some mythology encyclopedia when I came across a passage that rerouted little Frans life course. There, squished in the prose as if it were nothing, was the sentence, Apollo had a young and beautiful lover, and his name was Hyacinthus. I remember thinking it was some kind of typo. I remember feeling the ground shift. I read the sentence again, this time carefully, only to find I had not misread it. Even though the concept of gay doesnt quite apply to same-sex relationships in Ancient Greece, a 13-year-old latent homosexual saw himself reflected for the very first time. Gay people existed. Or gay somethings existed. And not just that, but they could be heroes. They could kill monsters, rescue lovers, smite humans all sorts of cool things. I was searching for a queer champion who picked up a sword and actually, literally slayed something. And so began my hunt. I searched high and low for the fabled gay at the places you usually do: late-night episodes of Will & Grace, clandestine copies of Out magazine, and every gay YA novel I could get my hands on. As I grew older, I came out with varying degrees of success, and my search deepened. I spent years in college researching a high volume of gay genres in media and literature, made it the pounding question and white-hot center of my work. But as I pored over Capote and Ginsburg and Frank-N-Furter and Hedwig, I couldnt find the hero I was looking for. And I dont mean a hero in the way Harvey Milk or Audre Lorde were heroes they were living heroes and legends in their right. I was searching for a queer champion who picked up a sword and actually, literally slayed something. Where was my gay Odysseus? Where was my lesbian Wonder Woman? And more importantly, why? Why had this longing stayed with me for almost a decade? And why is it I really have yet to find what Im looking for? View this image  Google gay superheroes and youll unearth a short ledger of gay characters conceived by Marvel and DC Comics all the way back to their first, Northstar from Uncanny X-Men, in 1979. These characters have always fallen short for me somehow. Throughout the 80s, Northstars sexual identity was a victim of subtlety. Creator John Byrnes editor restricted him from explicitly mentioning Northstars sexuality outside of implied hints; Northstar wasnt even allowed to utter the words I am gay until 1992. Later, in a 2006 resurrection of the Batwoman series, Kathy Kane was deemed a lesbian and given a prominent, recurring romantic narrative. Promising! Very shortly after she proposed to her girlfriend, though, her series was canceled before they could even tie the knot. Then, three years ago, Green Lantern was reintroduced as a gay man in a series called Earth 2, a spin on original versions of classic DC characters placed in a new and different world. Although Green Lantern did have an unapologetic gay narrative, its a bit demoralizing that his gayness was only possible in a parallel universe. And it was only this year, after almost 40 years of novels, that the Star Wars book series introduced its first major gay character. In 2015, Midnighter become the first gay male character in comic history to have an ongoing solo series 36 years after the very first LGBT character was introduced. People deserve characters, not caricatures, Midnighter writer Steve Orlando told BuzzFeed News. Since its solo debut, Midnighter has received lots of praise from gay media a difficult audience to please. To break the stereotype of anachronistic gay representation, you have to show queer people doing things that arent related to relationships, that arent related to sexuality, he said. Its important to show the coming-out story, the personal tragedy, the personal loss. That happens to people, but not to everyone. You have to change that narrative. And though the mainstreaming of gay characters in comic books is ever on the rise, the actual consumption of comic book culture has yet to really become mainstream. While comic books are a huge industry at least 47 million people read comics as of February 2014, according to Facebook they arent found in the majority of bookstores. And the number of comic book readers cant even come close to those who regularly watch films, which is basically everybody over two-thirds of Americans and Canadians go to a movie theater at least once a year. Although three of the top 10 highest-grossing U.S. films of all time come from comic books, none of these Marvel or DC blockbusters centers on an LGBT hero. After remaking tired narratives like Spider-Man, Daredevil, and (oh god) The Fantastic Four, the superhero TV/movie industry has not told the stories of women superheroes beyond terrible attempts such as Jennifer Garners Elektra or Halle Berrys Catwoman both characters with queer histories desperately in need of fleshing out. Were continually led to believe that the archetype of a hero is a straight, white, cisgender man with a perfect body, little emotional complexity, and a passion for crushing stuff. Catwomans interest in women is only a recent development. Since her narratives had often flirted with same-sex relationships, reading her official coming-out kiss with Eiko Hasigawa this year in Catwoman #39 didnt quite feel like a coming-out at all, but rather an effortless, leather-clad slink into the LGBT world. Elektra had a lesbian relationship in the Punishermax series, but in her movie, Jennifer Garners Elektra was only given a relatively platonic, highly eroticized same-sex kiss from Typhoid that seemed to serve the straight male gaze more than anything. Just from watching the clip on YouTube (dont watch the whole movie, justdont), any gay person could tell this scene was directed by a straight guy. Straight guys, of course, have always been catered to when it comes to superhero narratives. In the landscape of contemporary masculinity, its easy to look at the superhero films of the last year or so and see what were supposed to regard as a hero. The superhero film industry has largely failed to represent women, trans and gender-nonconforming people, and people of color. Though weve had some small steps like Michael B. Jordan in the latest Fantastic Four flop, and token female characters in ensemble narratives, like Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, these steps are not nearly big and bold enough. With Batman v. Superman in production, along with another X-Men and another Captain America, were continually led to believe that the archetype of a hero is a straight, white, cisgender man with a perfect body, little emotional complexity, and a passion for crushing stuff. As the industry is discovering more and more that the money is in the sequels, its retelling superhero stories that are easy to universalize rather than reinventing the unsung myths of our queer forebears (and god forbid we come up with an original gay hero). The riskier storylines have barely been given thought. If you dont have any queer representations, yet you still have all the hetero-panic about gay people, even as a joke in the mildest way possible, then thats kind of a failure, Zan Christensen, founder of Northwest Press a publisher devoted to putting out LGBT comics told BuzzFeed News. He discussed how gay people in films often function as the butt of a joke, thrown into background scenes to add edginess. Ultimately, the case for fully realized queer superheroes goes beyond representation for representations sake. Including queer characters in modern-day adventure movies would fundamentally influence the way the next generation thinks about queer people the same way my own view of the world shifted when I learned a Greek god could have a boyfriend. Maybe that is elementary for you and me and for anyone else in the queer community, but for people who are largely isolatedthey need that, said Orlando. They need to see how we can fall into a society when were not this weird other group. Its simple. At a young age, if you see yourself reflected in popular narratives, you feel less like an anomaly. When you see someone like you accomplishing something great, you too feel capable of great things. View this image  Theorist Judith Halberstam writes in her book The Queer Art of Failure, Queer studies offer us one method for imagining, not some fantasy of an elsewhere, but existing alternatives to hegemonic systems. If most of the existing queer narratives the Brokeback Mountains and the Blue Is the Warmest Colors must function on a plane of hegemonic systems (oppression, hate crimes, trying relationships), we have much to explore with this new terrain of the elsewhere. Most superhero narratives and adventure stories take place in that elsewhere a fantasy time and space. People can shoot lasers out of their eyes. Hydras exist. Presumably, this fantasy land would mean expanding the scope of what a gay character could accomplish, because she/he/they wouldnt have to prescribe to what is currently considered normal. A fantasy narrative, for all intents and purposes, could serve as a clean slate upon which the queer character could write a different kind of history. When you see someone like you accomplishing something great, you too feel capable of great things. Adventure narratives radically remove us from our own worlds and legislations. Instead of fretting about internal conflict, or about the problems associated with our actual lived reality, the adventurer is far more concerned with launching a thousand ships, beheading a lion, saving New York City, etc. Young Avengers was an opportunity, Kieron Gillen, a GLAAD awardwinning writer on the comic, which has included numerous LGBT characters, told BuzzFeed News. There were so many narratives out there where its all tormented, but I wasnt going to make this misery porn. Heres a fantasy you could lose yourself in without being drowned in the social realism. A gay superhero story can go two ways: a fantasy divorced of realitys social inequalities, or a fantasy littered with softcore misery porn as a result of those social inequalities. We see the latter in a botched gay comic character Iceman who was forced to come out in All-New X-Men #40 this past spring. As two characters from the original 1963 series share a private conversation, Jean Grey accuses Iceman of homosexuality with You are! and Iceman denies it like a good, stock closeted boy with Im not. Iceman is subjected to hetero-realism and the stigma that comes with his orientation. Because of that, the characters narrative must come to a screeching halt upon interrogation a halt which disrupts the heros opportunity to define himself as a hero. Adventure theorist Paul Zweig defines a hero using the term the incident. The incident is when all of a heros life must be translated into action. When the physical incident slaying dragons and shit is the No. 1 priority of a story instead of internal conflict (Why am I gay?), the narrative doesnt have to be disrupted or rerouted by bigotry or its repercussions, as we saw with Iceman. For Orlando, writing Midnighter meant that he wouldnt need any sort of permission. The seriess critical acclaim often cites the title characters sheer freedom to exist outside of sexual oppression. We have to do it in such a way where the story isnt stopping and staring at these things and putting undue stress on queer themes, Orlando said, describing his best practice in constructing LGBT narratives. Despite the fact that it comes from a point of saying Look how OK with this we are, its also pointing a finger at it, saying, Look how normal this is. Well, thats not how we want things to be, either. View this image  If we were to take gay characters outside the context we associate them with and place them into this new space of action-adventure, we could foster entirely new conversations when it comes to the mainstreaming of LGBT characters. There are more than a few ways to spark these conversations. Whether the queer character is slipping into an otherwise completely unrelated narrative without disruption in a leather catsuit, or is so loud and bombastically gay that queer themes guide his/her/their story, narratives about queer people hold value when there are lots of them to choose from when one character doesnt stand in for all of us. Piece by piece, were fixing a diversity problem. Were working against the erasure of queer people from our books, our movies, our news, our history, our cereal advertisements. Action-adventure stories give LGBT characters agency, the opportunity to exist outside their usual context. If I could go back in time and sub out some identity-mulling and oppression narratives for bravery, strength, and bomb-ass sword-fighting, a 15-year-old me wouldve felt much less lost in the far corner of the library in Christian suburban Illinois. By upping queer representation, were creating mirrors. These mirrors reflect back upon a generation that so desperately needs to feel the OK-ness you feel when intimately relating to a fictional character when you turn the page of a book or watch a scene of a movie and there, you see yourself, conquering.

aS"U.S. District Court Judge Robert Doumar had called being transgender a mental disorder. View this image  BuzzFeed News / Dominic Holden Lawyers for Gavin Grimm, a transgender high school junior in Virginia, asked a federal appeals court on Wednesday to reassign his case to a different lower court when it goes trial. Grimms attorneys argued that U.S. District Court Judge Robert Doumar, who originally heard the case, has exhibited egregious behavior and holds preexisting views about transgender people and medical science that may compromise his judgement. At a July 27 hearing, as BuzzFeed News reported, Doumar repeatedly called gender dysphoria the medical term for being transgender a mental disorder and ignored expert testimony on the condition. Gender dysphoria is not considered a mental disorder by leading medical authorities or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders V. An 84-year-old Reagan appointee, Doumar also spent several minutes expounding from the bench on non sequitur grudges against government policies on sanctuary cities, enemy combatants, and pot and fears about the country changing. Judge Doumars repeated and gratuitous labeling of [Grimm] with a mental disorder, does not reflect the sensitivity or care the public should expect from courts addressing these issues, says the brief, which was filed with the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals by Grimms lawyers. It undermines public confidence in the fairness of the proceedings if courts appear unwilling to ensure that statements from the bench do not carelessly stigmatize transgender people. In short, the record reflects that [Judge Doumar] has strong opinions about medical issues and may be inordinately suspicious of the modern medical consensus regarding sex and gender if that consensus conflicts with [his] preexisting views. Grimms case concerns a Gloucester County School Board policy that requires students to use facilities that correspond with their biological gender, or gender-neutral single-person restrooms. Represented by lawyers at the ACLU, Grimm, 16, has argued the policy is stigmatizing and that segregating him from other boys in school facilities is a violation of Title IX of the Education Act of 1972 which bans discrimination based on sex. The federal government has weighed in repeatedly in recent years to say Title IX bans transgender discrimination as a form of sex discrimination. Grimm had sought an injunction to use the boys restroom at school while the case proceeds to trial. Judge Doumar rejected that request for an injunction and threw out the Title IX argument in summer. In the brief filed Wednesday, Grimm asks the appeals court to impose that injunction, requests a review of the Title IX argument, and calls for the case be transferred to a different judge when remanded for trial on the overarching legal questions. Citing Doumars comments in the courtroom about mating and his skepticism of certain biological functions, the brief argues that Doumar has shown preexisting views about medical science in general and medical science regarding gender and sexuality in particular that the court may have substantial difficulty putting aside. In short, Grimms lawyers state, the record reflects that [Judge Doumar] has strong opinions about medical issues and may be inordinately suspicious of the modern medical consensus regarding sex and gender if that consensus conflicts with its preexisting views. The courts medical opinions even extended to unfounded skepticism that a person could develop a urinary tract infection from delaying using the restroom, the brief says, citing an OSHA guide to identifying urinary tract infections caused by limited restroom access. The brief argues reassigning the case will preserve the appearance of justice, while avoiding waste because the case is still in its early stages. The very first stage began in December, when the Gloucester County School Board passed a resolution that restricts single-sex facilities to students with a matching biological gender. The policy apparently aimed specifically at Grimm, the only openly transgender student in the rural Virginia district also provided three gender-neutral restrooms for students who dont want to use their assigned single-sex restrooms. The school board has argued it is not violating Title IX because it applies its policy equally to students based on their birth sex meaning that Grimm could use the girls restroom. At the July 27 hearing, a lawyer for the Dept. of Justice was present to address that Title IX question, but Judge Doumar detoured into a soliloquy on unrelated subjects. Im happy to answer questions that you have on Title IX, if you have any questions, Justice Dept. lawyer Victoria Lill said amid Doumars tangents. But Doumar said he did not, instead grappling aloud with fears about the future. Where the United States is going scares me. It really scares me, he said. In asking the appeals court to assign the case to a new judge, Grimms lawyers write, The courts diatribe against DOJ for policies that have no relevance to this case raises additional concerns about public confidence in the fairness of the proceedings.

aS"The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance on the Nov. 3 ballot would uphold a ban on discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity. But critics are framing it as an effort to legalize sexually predatory behavior by men and transgender women. View this image  Via youtube.com Male sex offenders will prowl womens restrooms to corner young girls inside bathroom stalls if voters in Houston, Texas, approve a broad nondiscrimination law on the Nov. 3 ballot, according to a new TV commercial running in the nations fourth most populous city. Any man, at any time, could enter a womans bathroom simply by claiming to be a woman that day, says a female narrator in the ad, which plays largely on fears of transgender women and men posing as transgender women using public facilities. Even registered sex offenders could follow women or young girls into the bathroom, the ad intones. And if business tried to stop them, theyd be fined. View this image  Early voting began Monday on the proposal, called the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, which would bar discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sexual orientation, and gender identity. The measure would also prohibit discrimination against a dozen other classes of people. If upheld by voters, the law would apply in places of public accommodation, jobs, housing, and for services. View this image  Via youtube.com Despite the civil rights ordinances extremely wide scope, an opposition group behind the ad Campaign for Houston calls it a bathroom ordinance and focuses on the argument that it should be rejected to keep women and girls safe. The 30-second TV spot began running on Houston-area stations last week, and reflects bathroom-focused messages found the campaigns other materials. Protect womens privacy prevent danger, the narrator says over eerie noises in the background. Vote no on the Proposition 1 bathroom ordinance. It ends with a man cornering a small girl in a restroom stall. View this image  Via youtube.com The ordinance on the ballot was passed by Houston City Council in 2014, leading activists to run an referendum campaign to repeal it. If voters reject the measure in November, it will be void. Although broader in scope than LGBT rights, the referendum in Houston is notable as a possible milestone after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled for national marriage equality in June. As a major U.S. city in a conservative state, Houston may be a national bellwether for nondiscrimination bills, from Indiana to Congress. But religious conservatives, such as those behind the Campaign for Houston, have aggressively fought those proposals. Richard Carlbom, the campaign manager for Houston Unites, which is advocating to approve HERO, said the message of the ad is blatantly false. Following a little girl into a stall, you are going to be arrested you are going to be prosecuted, he told BuzzFeed News. There is nothing in the ordinance that would make that scenario legal. Likewise, Houston Police Chief Charles McClelland said in a press briefing last week that predatory behavior depicted in the commercial would remain illegal if voters uphold the law. Nothing will change about the violation of the law, he said, according to ABC 13. The Campaign for Houston did not respond to questions from BuzzFeed News such as why the group chose the campaign message and whether it has evidence nondiscrimination laws on the books in other cities have resulted in more incidents of restroom violence. Seven Texas cities and 19 states have varying LGBT nondiscrimination laws. Texas has no statewide discrimination protections for LGBT people. But the argument being raised in Houston is hardly unique rather, it has evolved in recent years as a central talking point used by critics of LGBT nondiscrimination laws. In 2015, debates over such laws have dwelled on restrooms in Florida, California, and Ohio. View this image  A mailer by Campaign for Houston likewise focuses on bathroom use and transgender people. Via harrisvoterinfo.com A man who says that he is a transgender female is still a man, no matter what he thinks he is, says a mailer from Campaign for Houston. A man dressed as a woman is a man who is engaging in deviant behavior. The mail piece adds that voters should decide for themselves if the law forces women to potentially be exposed to perverted men who want to invade their privacy and who may even be planning to harm them. Data suggest the law would mostly be used to address discrimination of racial minorities, not LGBT people. The city of Houston continues to receive complaints of discrimination that fall under the laws scope, even while it remains in limbo. According to city records, most complaints are regarding racial discrimination 56% while only 5% concern LGBT discrimination, according to city records from May 28, 2014, to Sept. 2, 2015. But dwelling on restrooms and religion appears to have been effective elsewhere. In April, voters in Springfield, Missouri, repealed an LGBT nondiscrimination law that had originally been passed by the city council. That vote came after religious conservatives invoked campaign themes of businesses forced to sell products for gay weddings and cross-dressing predators lurking in womens restrooms. In December, voters in Fayetteville, Arkansas, also rescinded an LGBT nondiscrimination ordinance after a repeal campaign said the vote about privacy and faith. youtube.com  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruled this summer that anti-gay discrimination is covered under existing civil rights laws. Now, a gay man in Miami is hoping to expand the scope of that win by taking the Obama administration to court. View this image  FAA Administrator Michael Huerta, left, and Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx Andrew Harnik / AP WASHINGTON David Baldwin is asking a federal court to order the Obama administration to pay up for alleged anti-gay discrimination he claims to have faced while working for the Federal Aviation Administration in Miami. Baldwins lawyer told BuzzFeed News that the purpose of the lawsuit is much larger, though, aimed at expanding the scope of a recent agency ruling that found anti-gay discrimination is barred by existing civil rights laws. Mr. Baldwins case has the ability to affect more people than the [Supreme] Courts Obergefell [marriage] case because there are more gay men and women who have jobs than same sex couples who want to get married, Baldwins lawyer, Lowell Kuvin, told BuzzFeed News on Monday evening. Baldwin who alleges that he was passed over for promotions at the FAAs Miami Tower Terminal Radar Approach Control facility because he is gay took his case to federal court this past week, following up on a ruling in his favor this summer from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that allowed his case to move forward. Baldwin argued and the EEOC agreed that the ban on sex discrimination in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 includes a ban on discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation. [A]llegations of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation necessarily state a claim of discrimination on the basis of sex, the EEOC ruled in July in Baldwins challenge. Baldwin then had 90 days to decide whether to take the case to federal trial court. In the complaint, filed in federal court in Miami on Oct. 13, Baldwin sued Transportation Sec. Anthony Foxx and FAA administrator Michael Huerta in their official capacities. Baldwin claims that he was not selected for a permanent position as a [Front Line Manager] at the Miami Tower facility and that sex specifically, the fact that he is gay was the motivating factor for the fact that he was not promoted. Baldwin alleges that he was singled out due to his sexual orientation and treated differently than heterosexual co-workers by his supervisors due to inappropriate gender stereotyping, according to the complaint. View this image  As legislative efforts to pass explicit LGBT protections have stalled in Congress, the argument that sexual orientation discrimination should be or is covered under existing civil rights laws has been advanced in recent years by some advocates and, this summer, by the EEOC. While only the Supreme Court could issue a definitive ruling on the interpretation, EEOC decisions are given significant deference by federal courts. For now, however, the EEOCs decision is only binding on federal agencies. While the decision by the EEOC in Baldwin v. Foxx was a giant step forward for extinguishing sexual orientation discrimination by allowing federal employees to pursue sexual orientation claim under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title VII, it was just a small step forward for non-government employees, Kuvin, Baldwins lawyer, told BuzzFeed News on Monday evening. The next logical step for Mr. Baldwin, who would like to see the protection of Title VII extended to non-government employees alleging sexual orientation discrimination, was to bring the issue to the federal courts. Kuvin added that Baldwin only decided to take the matter to federal court once it became apparent that the issues were not going to be resolved through conciliation with the FAA, which Kuvin said never responded to Baldwins attempts to resolve the matter without litigation. The move on sexual orientation coverage by the EEOC is not surprising. In 2012, the EEOC took similar action regarding the coverage of anti-transgender discrimination, finding in a case brought by Mia Macy that gender identity-based discrimination is covered under the sex discrimination bar in Title VII. The Obama administration has since concurred with that interpretation, but it has not announced such agreement with the EEOCs interpretation as to anti-gay discrimination. Baldwins case has been assigned to U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams, appointed to the bench in 2011 by President Obama. One leading advocate of the EEOCs cases encouraged others to file similar cases. The EEOCs strongly reasoned Baldwin ruling deserves deference from federal courts across the country, and we hope the federal district court in Florida will join federal courts in Washington state and Washington, D.C. in ruling that gay plaintiffs can bring Title VII claims, Freedom to Works Tico Almeida told BuzzFeed News. More LGBT Americans should follow the lead of courageous people like David Baldwin and Mia Macy by filing claims under the sex discrimination bans in the Civil Rights Act, the Fair Housing Act, and other existing federal statutes. Messages were left with the Transportation Department and FAA press offices seeking comment on the lawsuit. View this embed  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The comedic couple bravely endure a series of questions regarding their love life, stand-up careers, and why we have to stop asking women about being women in comedy. View this image  Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Comedians Cameron Esposito and Rhea Butcher, who are both just as in love with comedy as they are with each other, stopped by BuzzFeed for a quick round of high speed questioning during their national tour. Some of these questions are pretty serious others are not. How did you get into comedy? Cameron: I started when I was in college, when I was nineteen years old in my college improv group. I havent stopped since then. Rhea: I started taking improv in Chicago and then I went to [Camerons] open mic. Cameron: Thats true! I was the first person to ever introduce Rhea on stage when she started stand-up. Shes a genius, she hates when I say that but she was actually super good right away. How did you get into each other? Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Cameron: Before we were ever dating, Rhea and I used to work together. We used to tour together. I was touring on a national level and needed someone to feature, do twenty minutes before I did an hour. So we were dating other people and just touring as friends and comics. And then we werent dating other people and I was like, Hey, shes cute. Lets date. What is it like to work and travel with your fiance? Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Rhea: She does my makeup and changes my hair. Cameron: It is awesome. It is the best, but also so stressful. Its the worst. We hate it. We hate each other [laughs]. Thats what is so great about it. There is nobody else Id rather be with at a weird hotel in the middle of a bizarre small town. I think its very intense to put that much pressure on a relationship. Its a lot of time together. Who is your celeb crush right now?  Cameron: Jake Arrieta! He plays baseball for the Chicago Cubs, which is where Im from. I grew up in Chicago and hes pitching, doing such a great job. Hes so handsome. Jonathan Daniel / Getty Images Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Rhea: My celeb crush is Julianne Moore. Cameron: Thats a good one. Shes beautiful. I want to look like her right now. Rhea: All the time. Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Mike Coppola / Getty Images As a comedian, in your opinion, is any topic off the table? Is anything fair game? Cameron: I have a very specific answer to this which is: No, I dont believe any topic is off the table, but I believe you need to have a reason to talk about really taboo topics. So, when things have a lot of emotion or tradition behind them when youre going to take on a topic thats really huge you need to have a reason to talk about it. And then you need to prove what youre saying! I think when comics get into trouble its when they talk about something that they dont really care about or its a huge issue and theyre just delving into it because they think its going to be risqu. I also think they get into trouble when what theyre saying, they dont actually support. You cant come on stage and introduce a topic just to get a reaction out of people thats irresponsible. I think it makes you a better comic. You should be able to take on high-pressure issues, but take them on in a way that helps the world and proves your view point. Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Best lesbian movie, in your opinion?  Rhea: My favorite lesbian movie is one thats like a butch buddy movie called By Hook Or By Crook. Its really artsy, but I absolutely love it and I think its fantastic. Cameron: Yea, Rhea loves that movie. My favorite lesbian movie is the film Bound. I love that movie and the sex scenes are choreographed by a woman who really does sleep with women, so it really helps. It looks like how real women have sex, as opposed to you know the movies where their hands are just up here? What are you doing that seems to be so satisfying? BuzzFeed/ Josh Harell BuzzFeed/ Josh Harell Cameron: But, I love that movie and its the Wachowskis first movie and its why they got the funding to make The Matrix. If you havent seen this movie? Awesome Noir. I love it so much. Worst lesbian movie?  Cameron: Oh, I feel like Im not going to answer this. I wont disparage my fellow lesbians. Rhea: Because everyone is trying. Even the worst lesbian movie is still a lesbian movie in a world where there are not that many lesbian movies. Cameron: Everyone is trying! Even the worst lesbian movie I have watched on Netflix and paused at the sex scene so later, when I come back to Netflix, Ill already have the sex scene loaded. Where do you see yourself in five years? BuzzFeed/ Jarred Harrell BuzzFeed/ Jarred Harrell What do you do on your day off?  Rhea: I go to the batting cages. Cameron: Rheas really into baseball. I go on hikes, we play with our dog. Straight up? We dont take any days off. Rhea: Two or four days a year? Cameron: What do we do on our day off? We say, Ah, I cant believe we have a day off! Do we have to get any work done? What are you being for Halloween? Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Interview question you are most tired of hearing?  Cameron: What is it like to be a woman in comedy? Im tired of that question because I feel like we could ask, What is it like to be a woman? Period. That would answer that question. What is it like to be a woman? We get paid less, our bodies are ridiculed, and we push babies out of them thus continuing the human race. Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Cameron: My point is, what is it like to be a woman? Its difficult! But thats why its awesome because the struggle is real! And then, so gorgeous. So I hate, What is it like to be a woman in comedy? Because its just like: What is it like to be a woman in a house? What is it like to be a woman walking down the street? Terrifying. Exciting. Theres a sisterhood. Its powerful. Its beautiful. What is your fondest childhood memory? Cameron: The day I was born. I looked out at the world and said, Get ready for me! Rhea: I think mine was going to see the Cleveland Rockers WNBA team play in the playoffs. Theyre not a team anymore, but my mom and I decided we should go to this. We walked up and got tickets and its still the most exciting sporting event Ive ever seen. Cameron: The Rockers were really important in my childhood, but Im talking about Barbie and The Rockers a band of barbies. Derek was in the band, you look like Derek! Rhea: Thats the whole point. Cameron: Thats the whole point, that you look like Derek? The point of your life? Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Favorite comedian? And not each other! Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News One piece of advice for aspiring comedians?  Cameron: Number one, out of a series of one: Its just about doing work. It feels like theres a magic thing, like you have to wait for these things to happen or get on this open mic list. No Its time and reps. So you just get on stage as much as you possibly can, as many times as you can per week. Then its going to take ten years. So, just know that. Rhea: Fail as many times as you possibly can, so that when you get to a big point or a big show youre not afraid of failing. Cameron: Thats true. You have to fail. Your favorite comics have all failed, they still fail. If you want to have a life-long career and you hope to live a long life, youre going to have to fail a lot in that span. Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News What is the worst thing a heckler has ever yelled at you?  Cameron: I was in Las Vegas and somebody yelled out, Youre the devil! But, they yelled it in a very deep voice, like: Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Cameron: Which, I think that was the devil. And also, like, in Vegas? Really? They were just saying it because I was onstage talking about marrying a woman. That rarely happens but its super fun when it does. Rhea: I think I had someone once say, We get it, youre gay! Which is like the silliest thing to heckle. What is the meaning of life?  Cameron: Monty Python. Rhea: Is that your answer? Cameron: I dont know, but I liked it. Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Rhea: The meaning of life is to put good energy out into the world. Thats the only thing that never goes away. We will have this energy on this Earth forever. So, thats all youve got left when you leave. Cameron: That is so mind blowing. I think the meaning of life is to move towards improvement for yourself and for humanity. That means whatever you want it to mean, so just get out there and be better. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .

aS"Because being trans is hella complicated. View this image  New York Review Books David Levenson, Getty Images The classic trans memoir that has stayed in print for four decades, Conundrum is engrossing reading as much for Morriss ebullient prose and florid style as it is for glimpses of how her reading public viewed transsexuality in her time. Morris keeps it positive as she portrays her journey from a sensitive and prized young boy whos convinced that he should have been born a girl, to her seemingly breezy path to actually living this reality; she views gender discrimination as one of the necessary evils of being a woman. Whatever obstacles she experiences stay firmly on the sideline, as Morris is eager to tell her encouraging tale, which may, I suspect, mask her struggles at a time when there was much greater stigma against trans women. Perhaps Conundrums tone reflects Morriss attempt to encourage other transgender women who fear the repercussions of transition. University of Chicago Press Deirdre McCloskey McCloskey brings both her robust analytical skills as an economic historian and the unique perspective of someone who struggles to pass as cisgender to Crossing. In a clear-eyed dissection of gender transition through the metaphor of migration, McCloskey describes the harrowing experiences of trying to be perceived as a woman, including extensive surgeries, forced commitment to a mental institution, and the loss of her immediate family. McCloskeys reductive view of the genders can at times feel unfeminist, as she tends to create sharp divisions between things that men and women do and the way each gender thinks. Despite this drawback, Crossing is an astute work that brings a great deal of lively insight into what it means to migrate to a new gender. Broadway Books James Bowdoin In contrast to McCloskeys analytical tone, Boylans approach is decidedly poetic. In Shes Not There , Boylan brings the reader close to her experience through a combination of humor and sincerity. The early parts of the book are particularly strong, especially when she describes her experience playing a game called girl planet, where she gets her wish and lands on a new planet that turns everyone female. Her struggle to maintain her family and adjust to her new relationship with her close friend, acclaimed novelist Richard Russo, are also key highlights. If Boylans humor can sometimes feel like it masks deeper feelings, its certainly a method that consistently wins the readers sympathy. Atria Books Michael Locissano, Getty Images The only book-length trans memoir written by a woman of color, Mock also distinguishes herself through her ability to be fully vulnerable without losing her focus. Framed as a confession to her future fianc Aaron, Redefining Realness takes its reader through Mocks difficult life from childhood abandonment and abuse to her experience as a sex worker while remaining grounded in deep personal insight. Parts of Redefining Realness do prioritize politics over subtlety, but its the moments when it feels as though Mock is discovering herself through the process of telling her story that give readers the most impactful, searing portrait of self-determination. Zoe Dolan Zoe Dolan After gaining public recognition as the transgender lawyer who defended Osama Bin Ladens son-in-law, There Is Room for You shows how this is only one of many episodes in Dolans storied life. Whether its in recounting her travails with men while struggling with sex addiction, or witnessing a close friend and dozens of other men in Egypt get arrested at a gay nightclub, Dolans prose is as lively as the stories she tells. But because the book jumps around so much as she describes her travels, its confounding when she slows down and settles on the factual world of describing criminal law, rather than the emotional one where she has battled many demons to get to a place of comfort with her gender and the rest of her life. But this doesnt detract from the excitement of Dolans adventures, and her story of success despite the difficulties of her past. Verso Verso With a story as direct as its title, Jacquess Trans gives us a straightforward glimpse into what its like to medically transition through the British healthcare system now, while dealing with the struggles of a freelance journalist and student. Along the way, we also get to learn about previous transgender narratives in various media, as the book shifts back and forth between Jacques personal story and her analysis of the ways that other trans stories have been written. There are times when Jacques writing lacks energy in her effort not to present the trans womens journeys as heroic. Nevertheless, Jacques come closest to conveying that as much attention as transgender women are getting today, many of us wish to be seen beyond our trans status, and that our existence has significance beyond this one aspect of our lives.

aS"The new movie about a mother and son held captive is an intense, moving must-see. Emma Donoghue, who wrote the novel and adapted it into a screenplay, talked to BuzzFeed News. MAJOR SPOILERS ahead! View this image  A24 During Rooms running time just under two hours you will gasp, shudder, grip your seat, cry hard, and, yes: you will laugh. Lenny Abrahamsons film, adapted from Emma Donoghues 2010 novel and then her screenplay, is an affecting, active moviegoing experience. Dont be scared, though. It is worth it. Brie Larson plays a young woman who has been held captive in a shed for seven years, and Room begins on her son Jacks fifth birthday. Jack (Jacob Tremblay) was born into this minuscule world, and not only has he never been outside, he doesnt know there is an outside. His mother, whom he calls Ma, has protected him from the knowledge that they are prisoners and that there is an entire world beyond the confines of their shed. They exercise, they read, they watch a small amount of television, and Ma shields Jack from their captors nightly visits. They communicate in a language without articles, since theres only one of everything: rug, wardrobe, room. Thats the premise of Room but then everything changes. Room is now in limited release. The film premiered at the Telluride Film Festival in early September, and then screened at the Toronto International Film Festival, and has been drawing raves and Oscar buzz since for Larson, Tremblay, the screenplay, and the movie itself. For Donoghue, an Irish-Canadian novelist, her own role in Rooms publicity campaign has come as a surprise. I always thought the writer was the least important element of the film, she said with a laugh recently over lunch in Beverly Hills. Donoghue adapted her own work, but those who have read the book and see the film will notice she was not precious about making changes. Things are added and subtracted; characters change, as do settings. Its a stripped-down self-edit that will please book loyalists, but also immediately grip people who know nothing about Rooms plot and its twists. Donoghue talked to BuzzFeed News about her close involvement with making the film, working with Abrahamson, the cast, and how her own life did (and did not) help create the novel and movie. There are many, many spoilers below, about both large and microscopic plot points. So stop reading now and go see Room if you dont want to be spoiled! View this image  A24 I know it might seem cocky, she said. But I didnt want to feel I was going to try to bully a company into hiring me as the screenwriter just because I owned the novel. Donoghue had written novels, short stories, and plays before, but until Room, she said, I never felt I had quite such a filmable story. She decided to adapt it herself on spec, thinking that, yes, there would be interest in making Room into a film. If they like it, we can work together, she remembered thinking. If they tell me its rubbish and I believe them, I may say, OK, let somebody else do it. I was just trying to be cards-on-the-table about it. Though Rooms story was inherently dramatic, if not cinematic, its structure posed some challenges. The novel is told entirely from Jacks 5-year-old perspective, which would not be the case in a film. Though Abrahamsons direction often allowed the audience to share Jacks gaze, Donoghue embraced the difference in medium as she wrote the screenplay. Cinema doesnt spell everything out, she said. It gives visual information quickly, say, about the room. But often youre looking at Jacks face and you dont quite know what hes feeling in that moment where in the book, you know exactly what hes feeling. In the film, often these big beautiful faces of the actors, theyre kind of a blank screen, and we project ourselves onto them. Plot-wise, Rooms story cleaves into two halves: the story of Jack and Mas imprisonment in room, and then the aftermath of their escape. The first half was way easier to write we did far less worrying over the script, Donoghue said. The first half has a real momentum: Will they get out? The screenplay was a living document throughout the whole process, even in editing. There was no final moment with the script, Donoghue said. All the way through, theyd improvise some bits, or Lenny would email me and say, You know what, we need a bit of dialogue, can you make it up to me for Tuesday? Even in postproduction, hed write to me and say, Oh, Im missing something, write with me. There was a wonderful fluidity to that. View this image  A24 Room was released in 2010 after a bidding war, and the novel not only became a best-seller, but it was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. Which is to say that Donoghue and Room received a good amount of publicity back then. She was honest at the time that the story was in part inspired by Elisabeth Fritzl, who had been held in a basement by her father, Josef, for 24 years and had seven children throughout her years of being raped and imprisoned. I was naive in ever specifying that, because I didnt realize people would get so stuck on the real crime case, Donoghue said. I just thought I would answer the question once and for all so people wouldnt waste time speculating. She had changed everything she could about Rooms plot to differentiate it from the Fritzl family, she said setting it in the United States, giving Ma only one child, having her kidnapper be a stranger, and putting their home/prison aboveground in a shed. But, she said, any one true crime case kind of sticks to works based on it, and she watched with dismay as the novel was often reviewed as the Fritzl novel. All I really wanted to take from it was the notion of parenting in a locked room, Donoghue said. One thing that I really clicked with Lenny about is that we were always looking for the universal in the story, we were not hung up on the crime aspect. The crime is just a really useful frame its a way of putting family in the spotlight. John Phillips / Getty Images Lenny Abrahamson, Donoghue, and Brie Larson at the BFI London Film Festival this month in London. Donoghue, who had wanted to be as involved as she could be in the making of the movie, was persuaded by Abrahamsons writing her a 10-page letter about his passion for Room. Like Donoghue, Abrahamson the director of the esoteric alt-music comedy Frank, among others is from Dublin. And he has a son and a daughter, as does Donoghue. He spoke in a very heartfelt way as a father, Donoghue said. Like me, I think he found that parenthood had broken him and remade him. Hes a very literate and literary man, she continued. So the letter was beautifully written and erudite he has a background in philosophy. He picked up references to Platos Cave, and that kind of thing. He had an intellectual level that won me over, and just a gleeful enthusiasm for the book. And then there was the letter itself. Its the very fact that he wrote a letter, where mostly what people do is put out feelers and then have lunch, Donoghue said. View this image  A24 Room could have been told very differently there could have been flashbacks to the kidnapping, or to Mas life before her captivity. The room itself could have been different, or more emphasis could have been put on Old Nick, the name Jack and Ma have made up for their nameless captor. But Abrahamson stuck faithfully to the novels architecture and its ideas about parenting as world building. Writing in the context of a relationship with the director, your screenplay doesnt have to be as clean and shiny. For instance, many of my scenes, I went in late and got out early, with crisp edges, Donoghue said. And Lenny would be like, Nah, write it long, write it like a wildlife documentary. Give me lots of material and then Ill do the cutting. Once the two characters get free, Donoghue said, It was really important not to lose that focus on Jack and Ma in the bigger world. She set about stripping down their experiences outside of room Mas brother and his family were cut, as were any other extraneous characters. The story of Mas stillbirth before Jack was born was also eliminated. Donoghue lamented that loss, but said: A book can stop, and have lots of little pauses, and extra bits of backstory and information. Film has kind of a forward momentum. I quite see why that one went. Ma, whose name we find out is Joy Newsome, was also aged down from 19 to 17 in the film, because if she had been above 18, the FBI would not have investigated her kidnapping. And the characters became less religious. Because Lenny is a fervent atheist, Donoghue said with a laugh. Im a believer. The interesting thing is we clearly overlap, we both utterly believe in the love of the parent for a child, so thats the faith the story relies on. On the whole, though, Donoghue worried more than necessary about how much she might need to change. I had a few false assumptions about how things need to be different in films than in books, she said. I was all worried that Jack doesnt seem to push the plot on in the second half I didnt want my hero to be passive. Lenny was not bothered by that. He kept saying, Lets go back to the book, lets go back to the book. So it wasnt like I was arguing for the book, and he for the film the two of us are madly enthusiastic about both forms. Donoghue was thrilled to collaborate with Abrahamson, but she was never under any illusion that she had as much power over Room as he did. Scriptwriter and director its not an equal partnership. I was given such a privileged access to the project, but of course I know a film belongs to its director, she said. I felt that the things that really mattered about the story were about the mother and the child being able to construct a meaningful life together in a cell. The details didnt matter too much, whether it was Dora the Explorer or whether it was baby Jesus. (Also: The book had such success that it made me in many ways say, fine, the film is yours!) View this image  A24 Once Joan Allen was cast as Mas mother, Nancy, Donoghue said she adjusted the character. In the book, Jacks grandmother is vulgar she blunders, Donoghue said. Shes likable, but she gets it wrong. Somehow, as soon as we cast Joan, it lifted the grandmother to a higher level. And so Donoghue said she and Abrahamson tinkered with the writing to fit Allens style better. William H. Macys character, Mas father, turned out to be smaller than we were expecting, but still very powerful, said Donoghue. Its the character of Leo, Nancys new husband, played by Tom McCamus, who becomes a lovely, warm counterpoint to Old Nicks villainy and to Mas fathers coldness. Hes the first male figure in Jacks life to be worthy of his love. Even though the two grandfathers thing might seem complicated, to me it was really necessary to show that range of response that you wouldnt get everybody welcoming Jack to the world, Donoghue said. The two grandfathers to me is a way to show that spectrum. The horror of Mas father, his inability to bear the fact that she has this child and then the stepfather, he has way less of a stake in it, hes much more able to say, Come and have breakfast. View this image  A24 For Ma, Abrahamson had to find an actor who was both exceptionally talented and exceptionally pleasant to be around. Donoghue said, He said to me, We just cant afford to have anyone behaving in a childish way, because we have an actual child. Then there were the demands of the role itself. Bries performance has to be multilayered, because shes not just being an authentic person all the way through, said Donoghue. Shes faking it in all sorts of ways: She has to fake it with Jack, she has to fake it differently with Old Nick, she has to fake it for the TV cameras. Theres that amazing scene where shes pretending her child is dead, and yet shes pouring into that performance all the real rage and grief of all these years shes spent. Yet Larson also had to hold it together for Tremblay, who was 8 at the time. She could never go off to her trailer to have a big, intense moment she was always there to say Oh, lets tie your shoes or Lets try that again with your chin more to the left, Donoghue said. As she adapted the Jack character from her novel, Donoghue wondered whether there was a kid alive who could play the part. Lenny never got me to tone down what we would be asking of this child, she said. He said, Write it as if it were for a child genius we will find one. Actually, he had many a sweaty night, thinking, Will we find the child? After all, Tremblay is in every scene in the movie. The whole film would have fallen apart if we didnt have the right child, Donoghue said. Since Donoghue was sent the dailies every day, she could see how Abrahamson solicited Tremblays remarkable performance from him. Jacob couldnt read then, so hed learn his lines more or less, but Lenny would be like, OK, heres the bit where you ask her about the truck, Donoghue said. Jacob very quickly got the hang of it: Dont talk at the same time as Lenny so all of Lennys bits were removable. The love between Jack and Ma is the storys core; the ongoing real-life relationship between Larson and Tremblay has proven also to be entrancing, both in their public appearances and in Larsons social media feeds. You actually cant separate them, Donoghue said. Because not only did Brie gently coach Jake a lot, but he really helped her in a way relax and cheer up. She would do these very intense scenes, and then as soon as the camera stopped rolling, hed be like, What are you crying about? Hed instantly go back into fun mode. Also what I liked is they were kind of buddies rather than always like a mother and child. Because I wanted that quality between Ma and Jack as well shes pretty young, so theyre kind of kids together. A24 A24 Because, she said, voiceover can be used in a very lazy way to adapt literary novels its like the badge of quality. Here comes the portentous voiceover about the summer when I was 5. I just thought, this is cinema were making, so I have to be able to tell the story through showing, rather than through Jack telling. Abrahamson asked her to add it in a late draft. He said to her, I want it in a punctuation way I dont want it to explain or milk the emotion in any one scene. He wanted it, she said, to actually cool the temperature to slow the films harrowing momentum lest it turn melodramatic. For instance, in the scene after Ma has attempted to kill herself and the paramedics have come to Nancys house, Donoghue said, Youve got Jack talking about time and space in a way that works against that. View this image  A24 In the case of Mas suicide attempt, Donoghue said: I think the outside world, and the questions of the TV interviewer in particular, have made her for the first time seriously question whether she did the right thing. I think until then shed been holding herself together by saying, I was in a tough situation, I made something good out of it look, hes great, hes fine. I see it as a major crisis in her confidence as a mother, as well as the cumulative damage of all the years in there. (According to Donoghue, Wendy Crewson, the actor who plays the journalist who interviews Joy, suggested adding the line asking whether Joy had ever considered suicide during her captivity, planting the idea in her head.) It seemed to me that to have Ma recover too quickly in the second half would be really skimming over the reality of rape and of damage from a domestic violence situation, Donoghue added. It would have been believing Mas storyline: Oh, Im fine, Im fine. But I had to honor her by showing how deeply damaged she is. There was also a reason to separate Jack and Ma for Rooms narrative arc. In a way, he goes through what all kids go through but overnight, Donoghue said. Which brings Room to one of its most moving moments the scene when Nancy cuts Jacks hair and he says to her, I love you, Grandma. Its not a line from the book, and its heart-wrenching. Lenny said to me, Im going to film it long. It cools it down, it keeps it less emotional than if you had the close-up, Donoghue said. In this film, it was never a matter of finding moments to make the audience cry that was just a given. So quite often he does things to help the audience not cry, or to delay their cry. She continued: One thing thats lovely about it is most kids out in the world, especially in America where that line is said a lot, they say it so easily. Its like, I want some juice, I love you. But for Jack, whos come from such a different world, to be able to say to somebody not Ma, somebody else, its wonderful. Also, what makes that scene is Joans reaction. She kind of flinches. Its not an easy scene at all. Shes losing her daughter all over again, for the moment, and having to form this new relationship with a child who is a total stranger to her. So theres a wonderful kind of flickering shiver before she finds herself able to say, I love you too, Jack. View this image  A24 The character of Old Nick, played by Sean Bridgers, is deliberately a cypher. Theres none of that Aye, Im Dexter, Im special, Donoghue said. I love how unobtrusively hes introduced; I like the fact that you barely see him at first. Laid off from his job, and being the bearer of groceries more than anything else, Old Nick has found that after seven years, kidnapping is not what he thought it would be. The whole thing has gone septic, said Donoghue. Its a perverse fantasy thats become incredibly boring and grim. Readers know little about Old Nick, and filmgoers know even less. Its deliberate; this is not a true crime story, which Donoghue called a cultural obsession. If you start the whole thing with the kidnapper or kidnapping, its giving in to his storyline and saying, This is the story of an exciting psychopath.. Donoghue wanted to be sure there was no possible reading of this situation as titillating. I wasnt interested in the Stockholm syndrome story, she said. Over the years, Ive seen so many situations where kidnapping is basically eroticized, even in very playful films like Almodovars Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!. Its a storyline that just sets my teeth on edge the idea that you would start to get along with your kidnapper, or fall for him. I like the idea that of course Mas gotten used to this situation in some ways, but that doesnt mean shes fond of him. Shes enormously pragmatic and strategic. Ma is sexually assaulted every time she sees Old Nick, and she has been for seven years. Representing that on film was necessarily different from how it was rendered in Room the novel but the movie still relies on Jacks point of view in those scenes: The camera stays inside the wardrobe where Jack sleeps. Sticking to the childs perspective the childs shielded perspective was crucial there, because anything on film would be way more voyeuristic than on the page, Donoghue said. View this image  A24 Because Lenny and I are so used to the story and its dark premise, were not freaked out by it the way the average person in the street is freaked out, Donoghue said. When it was announced the movie was being made, Donoghue saw that it was being characterized as a horror movie or a terrifying crime drama. In order to bat back what Rooms premise suggests, she said, The trailer is very useful at sending out those signals that this really is a relationship film, and that its quite uplifting. Although I would always prefer the viewer as with the reader to know nothing at all, you have to persuade them to come read the book or see the movie, Donoghue said. The book only sold through word of mouth. And I think similarly with the film, people need the reassurance of a friend or family member saying either Ive read the book, and it doesnt depress you or The film is going to lift you up. View this image  A24 I think I would have suffocated the baby on day one. Especially when I stepped onto the set, I was thinking, This is hideous. No way could she live here for seven years! Donoghue said. (The room scenes were filmed in a shed on a Toronto set with the correct, tiny proportions described in the book the camera shot from varied angles, with Abrahamson and the crew outside.) Donoghue and her partner, Chris Roulston, live in London, Ontario, where Roulston is a professor. Even though she is not Ma, Donoghue said her two children, now 8 and 11, did inspire how Jack talks and thinks. As well as how he gets out of a rug when she was writing the escape scene, Donoghue bribed her son into helping her figure out the logistics of rug wiggling. My son did a certain amount of screaming and had to be quickly unrolled, she said. Id reward him with a chocolate bar and then make him get back in the rug. More than anything, Room is about knowing love can keep you alive, and constructing a family that sustains you. And there, Donoghues own life as a mother in a same-sex relationship did influence its story. To us and to our kids, this feels normal, she said. Every now and then we have some encounter with the outside world where my kids suddenly realize, Oh, I had to explain the whole two mothers thing. Not everybody gets that. Theyre wonderfully confident ambassadors for a two-mother family. So I have that feeling of: You can have trust in your family as a functioning organism, even if its not the traditional shape. I tried to give that to Ma, Donoghue continued. She believes in her and Jack as a family, even though there are others would see it as a pathological situation.

aS"Cue Hailee Steinfelds Love Myself, please. I was in between jobs, I was getting over a rather esteem-crushing separation from my ex, and I was in need of a change in routine. As someone who consistently relied on other people and struggled with my own self-perception, I realized I needed to escape a comfort zone that really wasnt very comfortable. New York City has always been my favorite place in the world, but after a recent breakup (and moving home to New Jersey), so many of my favorite places in New York felt distant and became tainted with painful, used memories. Noticing that I had started to avoid the spots I once loved so much in the city, I realized I needed to reclaim them for myself and to make new memories on my own. Partially inspired by this brave and brilliant post, I decided to venture all alone to New York City, where Id lived my last year of college and made memories with close friends, my family, and my ex-boyfriend. Id spend the day there by myself and venture to my favorite spots, giving them new meaning on my own. I wanted to do more than just take back these places and memories, though I wanted to prove to myself that I could be just as happy in my favorite spaces without the company of anyone else. I was intent on feeling happy and loved and confident with just me. View this image  When I first arrived in New York last year, The High Line instantly became one of my favorite places to visit (and to generally loiter around). It was also the place where I had one of my first dates with my now ex-boyfriend, and so it was consequentially marred with painful thoughts and memories in the aftermath of our breakup. View this image  Heres one thing I found to be quite significant on my trip to the High Line: On that first date, my ex and I had noticed a sculpture that, while impressive, bore a striking resemblance to excrement. We aptly and quite maturely named it the poop statue. View on Instagram When I went back to the High Line this time, however, the infamous poop statue was no longer there. Perhaps it had been moved and I had just failed to see it, and maybe Im too sentimental (or obsessed with astrology), but I saw it as a sign. Things change, and people change. Nothing is permanent. View this image  When youre alone with your thoughts (and, I admit, Taylor Swifts 1989 on repeat), you really do notice things that you may have never picked up on when surrounded by other people. Little West 12th Street was one of those things. View on Instagram From the High Line, I walked through the Meatpacking District to the West Village, my favorite New York City neighborhood. View this image  Oftentimes when I visit the West Village, Im grabbing drinks with friends or going out dancing. It was strange to be in such a lively, crowded place all on my own. At times, it left me feeling incredibly lonely. View this image  When I arrived at Washington Square Park, I decided to embrace that feeling of solitude, and I perched myself on an empty bench and people-watched for the next hour. I didnt look at my phone; I wasnt sending texts. I fought the uncomfortable notion that I was crazy for sitting alone without having my eyes glued to my phone, but I reminded myself that today was not about comfort, and I made conversation with the woman next to me. She was sweet and open and had really cool pants, and I never would have met her if I hadnt been sitting on that bench alone and disconnected. View on Instagram I thought a lot about all my past ventures to Washington Square Park with friends, with my ex, with my family. Though Id been here many times before, being alone in a familiar space brought a new meaning to a place with which I already had so many connected memories. I recognized that I didnt feel any less happy on my own. Just different. View this image  Im pretty sure this was an advertisement for a store, but I liked it, and Im going to pretend that its meaning is tied to my journey toward self-love. View on Instagram In SoHo, I ventured to one of my favorite coffee shops. My phone had died, and I had to ask the staff to charge it behind the bar, so this time it was even easier to be away from my cell. I ordered a coffee and read in the corner, taking time to put down my book, absorb my surroundings and, again, appreciate the solitude. I noticed the appreciation was happening much more organically at this point. I felt like an angsty poet sipping espresso in the corner of a hip, smoky coffee shop, except I was drinking a sugary iced coffee and reading a book about Clueless while blowing my nose. View this image  When I first moved to New York last August, I relied on everyone around me for directions, subway advice, and other NYC-related tips. A year later, however, I could successfully traverse the entire lower half of Manhattan without losing my way; I could get lost in the city without actually being lost. So thats how I found myself alone in Chinatown. As I walked around, I took a moment to allow myself to be impressed with my hard-earned directional capabilities, and I reflected on how difficult it can be sometimes to avoid constant self-deprecation and simply to be proud of the things Ive accomplished. View on Instagram This was a HUGE deal for me, as I am a Swiftie to the damn core. I was literally listening to Bad Blood when I saw Karlie (aka Knockout) in the flesh. She was kind and gorgeous, and Id like to think we would have never met if Id decided not to walk around SoHo/Chinatown alone. It was a divine intervention of sorts. And it got me a lot of likes on Instagram. View this image  I did a lot of thinking as I walked from Chinatown to Midtown, but I mostly took time to embrace the gratitude I felt toward myself for what I had done that day. After spending so much time basking in self-deprecation and really struggling to accept any compliments I received at face value, to be able to thank myself and recognize the value in something that Id done all on my own was rewarding beyond measure. View on Instagram As I sat on the train back to New Jersey, I thought a lot about the weird, uncomfortable, sad, beautiful, enlightening, empowering day I had just experienced. Did I fall in love with myself? No. Had I removed all the hurt I was feeling from my breakup? Not really. Did I decide to move to a California ranch and live in solitude for eternity like Sidney Prescott in the third Scream movie? No, I love humans too much. But if nothing else, I realized that I do possess the ability to spend a day alone with myself and have a genuinely good time. I recognized that I dont need to be around other people to make lasting, pleasant memories, and that there is strength and power in independence. And I recognized that, above all, its important to take time to be kind to yourself and to recognize your own strengths and accomplishments. Real, true self-love is harder to find than most people might think, but taking small moments to appreciate your own strength and positive qualities can really bring you closer to finding that inner peace and self-acceptance. Because at the end of the day, if you cant love and appreciate who you are, how can you let anyone else? Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"As more trans women publish autobiographies, the emphasis of the genre has moved from tales of childhood and transition to depictions of fuller, deeper complexities. View this image  From left to right: Jan Morris, Deirdre McCloskey, Jennifer Finney Boylan, Janet Mock, Zoe Dolan, and Juliet Jacques. David Levenson (Getty Images), U Chicago Press, James Bowdoin, Michael Loccisano (Getty Images), Zoe Dolan, Verso What does it mean to be a trans woman? Whats transition for trans women like? These questions have been on many minds the past few months, and have spawned TV shows and movies, not to mention a huge number of Tumblr blogs, YouTube channels, and personal essays devoted to the topic (including some by yours truly). Yet even in this deluge of media, theres something about the intimacy and depth of the book-length memoir that allows a reader not only to view a persons experience from their perspective, but to live with that perspective for an extended period of time in that readers own imagination, as close to walking in anothers shoes as one can get. Two new memoirs by trans women Trans by Juliet Jacques and There Is Room for You by Zoe Dolan have been published this year, additions to what can now be properly called a trans memoir genre. Both books challenge aspects of the standard trans narrative, the need to justify trans womens existence, and the idea that transition is a heroic act. By looking at previous memoirs, from Jan Morriss Conundrum from 1974 to Janet Mocks Redefining Realness from 2014, its clear theres been steady movement away from exploring only the most titillating aspects of transgender experience but of course, trans womens lives have always been deeply complex.  View this image  Zoe Dolan In There Is Room for You, Dolan brings with her not just a life filled with exciting experiences, but also an ear for engaging prose. Dolan came to public knowledge in a New York Times profile, published while she was on the defense team in the trial of Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, a son-in-law of Osama bin Laden. Her memoir traces her route to discovering both her passion for law and her trans identity, with a backdrop of an addiction to sex that wreaked havoc on her life until she was able to control it. One of the telling features of trans memoirs is that they tend to frame their narratives around an inciting experience that moves them to tell their story, which conditions how the reader experiences the rest of the book. For Mock, its revealing her trans status to her future partner Aaron; for Jennifer Finney Boylan in Shes Not There from 2003, its an encounter with a hitchhiker who turned out to be a former student who knew her before transition. For Dolan, its a list of 25 facts that she wrote on Facebook, which she references throughout her book. It starts with 1. My first word was more and little has changed ever since, continues with, 17. I had transsexual surgery in Bangkok, and ends with 25. I have almost died several times. I am glad Im still here. In between, Dolan recounts adventures from Egypt to the Netherlands, usually connected in some way to an attractive man, as she winds up in the Queen Boat nightclub in 2001 when 52 gay men were arrested, including her friend Mahmoud, many of whom were subsequently sent to prison. This experience gave her the resolve to become a lawyer after years of intensive Arabic study, and to eventually defend people accused of terrorism as part of her private practice. Its glaring that Dolan doesnt hew to one of the standard conventions of trans narrative, which is to spend significant amounts of time dwelling on either the reasons why someone is trans or the minute details of their transition. Dolan has led a varied and fascinating life, and her lively prose (she trained as a playwright at NYU) imbues her experiences with even more energy. This is in full display in an excerpt of the book published by The Guardian, in which she describes Cinderella Syndrome withdrawing from men who were attracted to her because of her trans status which she experienced until she met a dashing Italian man in the Netherlands named Adriano. When he rejects her after he finds out shes trans, Dolan writes: I had stayed past midnight to dance a little longer with Adriano, which I should never have done. I had lost track of the ground while soaring through the sky. It was glorious, until everything fell apart. My gown had turned to rags, and I was covered in soot. This is the kind of evocative writing that characterizes There Is Room for You and makes many parts of the book thrilling to read. Its also glaring that Dolan doesnt hew to one of the standard conventions of trans narrative, whether in memoir or other forms, which is to spend significant amounts of time dwelling on either the reasons why someone is trans or the minute details of their transition. Dolan treats her transition experience as one of many significant events in her life and hardly discusses her childhood or why she ended up being trans. This is a departure from trans narratives that came before her. At the same time, the Facebook list that frames the book also contributes to its lack of cohesive structure; Dolans restlessness bleeds into her narrative. There Is Room for You can easily be three memoirs about a trans woman, a recovering sex addict, an international defense attorney but Dolans attempt to combine all three elements, at times in a single paragraph, creates both unnecessary confusion and an inability for the reader to sit with her experience before shes on to her next adventure. Dolan constantly shifts backward and forward in time in the middle of telling stories, which already pulls the reader from her narrative, but is even more confusing in a trans memoir because one is constantly having to figure out the state of her gender as she skips around. As a self-published book, There Is Room for You sometimes feels refreshing in its lack of professional polish, but there are also times when it feels indulgent, especially as the story moves away from Dolans trans self-discovery and toward her passion for law, expecting her reader to follow along. As she discusses how judges affect cases by choosing which evidence is admissible, Dolan uses a specific case as an example and writes: What I want to share with you are examples of this mechanism at work. So heres what happened at the Ibrahim trial all of it, then devotes multiple pages to discussing the case. This is when There Is Room for You feels less like an autobiography and more like a criminal law lecture. While a trans memoir doesnt always have to be just about trans experience as trans women are so much more than their transgender identity its also important that an autobiography maintains its focus, and Dolan spends too much time on law and not enough on her lived experiences. Dolans idiosyncratic style allows us to peer into her mind in an unfiltered way, but doesnt create that feeling of wholeness that comes from reading more fully reflective works by previous authors. The best memoirs leave you feeling like your mind has just been fed the most lavish meal. Dolan certainly has all the ingredients to create this type of experience, but in There Is Room for You, it feels as if she doesnt have the patience.  View this image  Verso For readers who are curious about the nuts and bolts of gender transition, Juliet Jacquess Trans is as direct as its title, opening with details about the authors gender reassignment surgery, then proceeding to discuss her gender evolution in roughly chronological order, with forays into trans theory and media criticism, as well as Jacquess passion for football. Based on a series of articles that she originally wrote for The Guardian, Jacques tracks the details of her transition through the National Health Services (NHS) in England. The odd thing about Trans is that even though it spends a lot of time dealing with the mechanics of transition, the book does so in a largely matter-of-fact way, devoid of the extended and emotional inner monologues that attend this event in previous trans narratives. For a British audience, the book is as much about how the British health care system treats a transgender patient as it is about the specificities of Jacquess transition, since the author spends a lot of time discussing the various doctor and therapist visits and bureaucratic hurdles she needed to go through before she could undergo the therapies and surgeries she needed. For instance, heres a typical exchange in the book, as Jacques visits a voice therapist who asks her to make some sounds then prints some charts: Youre at 133 Hz, he said. Ninety to 130 is usually considered male, so you are at the very highest end of that. Doesnt that make it androgynous? No, thats 160 Hz at the lowest. Try again. Jacques devotes many paragraphs to discussing trans media, theory, and history, which will be of interest to people who havent been exposed to a lot of trans-related work but ultimately feels out of place in a book thats framed as a memoir. I imagine that these kinds of details would be of interest to people who havent lived the transition experience, but these scenes dont offer a lot beyond a step-by-step recounting of the medical process. In an epilogue at the end of the book written as an interview with the author Sheila Heti Jacques discusses her desire to counter media portrayals of transition as a mythical heros journey. To me, Jacques writes, it didnt feel like that, rather a bunch of hoops to jump through while working in boring jobs. The ghost of Morriss Conundrum, a breezy heroines tale thats been ensconced as the canonical trans memoir, seems to haunt the book, but Trans accounts for neither more recent memoirs that portray gender transition as self-discovery without glossing over its difficulties, nor the fact that bureaucracy and office drudgery dont exactly make for thrilling reading. Its as if in trying not to objectify her life by turning herself into a hero, Jacques underestimates both the potential of her own existence beyond her status as a trans woman and the reality that many trans people see transition as a route toward self-acceptance. Even Jacques is aware of how ordinary her life can seem. Occasionally, I found myself wishing the street abuse would escalate, she writes, or that the medics would block my path, or that someone close to me would cut me off, just so Id have more colour in my articles. Jacques encounters plenty of obstacles in Trans, from harassment to her struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts, but she consistently distances herself from her experience, using both the step-by-step accounts of her medical transition and criticism of various trans-related media as tools. Apart from the medical account, Jacques devotes many paragraphs to discussing trans media, theory, and history, which will be of interest to people who havent been exposed to a lot of trans-related work but ultimately feels out of place in a book thats framed as a memoir. Jacques explicitly states that she wants to write like Julia Serano in Whipping Girl, a book of criticism that has become the standard reference point for many trans women. But in trying to shoehorn this kind of writing into a memoir, Jacques further distances herself from her reader, as she leaves me wondering why I keep reading about the lives of others in a book thats supposed to be about her own. Jacques writes in her epilogue, Initially, I wanted to directly address the readers about their expectations for trans narratives and how theyve been conditioned to read them. But the format of the memoir is so personal [] I needed to find a middle ground. Yet by attempting to question the memoir as a form while at the same time hewing to some of its strictures, Trans ends up feeling halfhearted, neither the book Jacques wanted to write nor the book that readers expect of a trans memoir. The form of the memoir may have its drawbacks, but it also endures because the best examples of the genre allow readers to closely identify with authors whove lived lives so different from their own. View this image  NYRB, U Chicago, Broadway, Atria While Dolans and Jacquess narratives both have limitations, they do reveal how transgender lives are endlessly complex, covering ground thats distinct from previous memoirs by trans women. And by challenging how memoirs have been written in the past, they also demonstrate that the trans memoir has become a developed enough genre that it has conventions to be challenged. But even as previous memoirs established those conventions like describing transgender feelings in childhood, or presenting transition as the culmination of a journey there are also numerous ways in which the lives they depict are vastly different. Among published works since Morriss Conundrum in 1974, Mocks has been the only recent book-length autobiography written by a woman of color. It tells the story of someone conventionally attractive who medically transitioned at 18. Deirdre McCloskeys Crossing from 1999 is the tale of a renowned economics professor who transitioned at 53, is over 6 feet tall, and has enormous trouble passing. While both stories fall under the genre of trans memoir, the struggles they relate are almost entirely different from each other. As transgender intersects with race, sexuality, economics, and beauty, its as though each element refracts trans lives and makes for an endless combination of deeply complicated pockets of experience. Then theres the challenge of trying to explain the nature of transgender identity itself. In an afterword to Boylans Shes Not There, her good friend and acclaimed novelist Richard Russo writes: The problem, as this memoir illustrates, is that the transgender persons experience is not really like anything. As a result, these memoirists spend copious amounts of space describing how they came to be trans, even as there continues to be an elusive quality to their recollections. Its as though in the end, there cant be any other explanation for a person being transgender than the fact that she is, just as a vast majority of people are cisgender just because they are. Yet its always the minoritys burden to explain herself because her experience is rare, while the majoritys experience, even if its just as mysterious, is widely known and therefore doesnt require explanation or justification. Over time, transgender memoirists have felt less and less of a need to justify their transgender feelings or mask the pain of their experiences. McCloskeys analytical mind comes closest to concretely describing the experience, as she uses the metaphor of migration to describe the movement from male to female: Most people would like to go to Venice on vacation. Most people, if they could magically do it, would like to try out the other gender for a day or a week or a month [] But only a tiny fraction of the crossgendered are permanent gender crossers, wanting to become Venetians. Migration is a powerful metaphor in that it captures both the mystery of how a person decides to cross the border of gender as well as the enormous challenges in doing so. And gender migrants, like their geographic counterparts, come with different sets of privileges and disadvantages that aid or interfere with acclimation to their new roles. Like the immigrant who cant get rid of her accent, McCloskeys own struggle to acquire a female voice leads to many people considering her an interloper in the land of women. The power of Crossing lies in the incisiveness with which McCloskey describes her experiences as well as her perspective unique among memoirists as someone who has enormous trouble passing. When she discusses the rejection of her family and her experience of being committed to a mental institution after she decides to undergo facial feminization surgery, McCloskey unflinchingly recounts how different trans experience is for those who feel themselves to be women, but are perceived so staunchly as male by others that their transgender status is equated with severe mental illness. Compared to McCloskey, Boylan recounts a gentler transition into womanhood, preserving her marriage and core friendships. She also speaks not McCloskeys analytical truth, but the poetic truth of someone who had built a career as a novelist by the time she transitioned in her forties. She communicates her experience not only through metaphor, but also by writing as though we as readers were reliving her experience with her. The early parts of Shes Not There are particularly effective, especially in the way Boylan writes about how her transgender feelings expressed themselves when she was a child. Sometimes I played a game in the woods called girl planet, Boylan writes. In it, I was an astronaut who crashed in an uninhabited world. There was a large fallen tree I used as the crashed-and-destroyed rocket. The thing was, though, that anybody who breathed the air on this planet turned into a girl. Games are a near-universal part of childhood, and Boylan uses hers to illustrate what was both typical and rare about her experience, ably and touchingly bringing the reader into her world. Boylans narrative is also peppered with a sly humor that is a trademark of her work she recounts her best friend Russo observing, You love that place between whats funny and whats terribly sad. For instance, Boylan writes of her early cross-dressing experiences: Wearing my sisters and mothers clothes wasnt exactly satisfying, though. For one thing, it was creepy, sneaking around. Even I knew it was creepy. Boylans gentle comedy makes her not just an entertaining narrator but a deeply disarming one, in her ability to find humor in lifes obstacles. There are times, though, when the humorous tone of Shes Not There reveals a hesitation to unearth what must be recesses of emotion under the surface. If a memoirists job is to dig deep, then Boylans humor sometimes feels like an impediment, though certainly a beguiling one. The person who thus leaves herself most vulnerable is Mock, who lays her life bare in Redefining Realness without being overly sentimental or self-objectifying, as she recounts incidences of childhood sexual abuse, parental violence, and sex work to fund her gender reassignment surgery. The most effective parts of Redefining Realness are those that move away from the factual and at times didactic realm of trans education and into the murky territory of Mocks inner life, as her memoir becomes a venue not just for communicating her experience to others, but for discovering the resonances of her life for herself. Mocks most painful recollection is the time when she had to appear in a transgender porn video so that she could pay off the balance of her gender reassignment surgery, an episode she recalls with harrowing clarity and restraint. I know that excluding it from this chronicle of my life would be cowardly, she writes. It would mean I was actively erasing a part of my journey. Why tell your story if youre not going to tell it in its entirety? This chapter of Redefining Realness illustrates its greatest achievement Mocks willingness to expose parts of herself that are the stuff of sexual fantasy, without any sense that she is doing it for spectacle. Ive read few authors like Mock James Baldwin and Joan Didion spring to mind as signposts who can slice so deeply to the core of their experience yet present the cut in such an evocative and insightful way. Weve come a long way from the breeziness of Morriss Conundrum, where a type of euphoric writing clearly obscures her struggle. Morris wrote in 1974: When I woke each morning I felt resplendent in my liberation. I shone! I was Ariel! More than 40 years later, her words seem replete with overcompensation, especially when authors who came after her have so minutely explored many recesses of transgender life in their own ways. Over time, transgender memoirists have felt less and less of a need to justify their transgender feelings or mask the pain of their experiences. They have also steadily felt less of a need to portray medical transition as a profound, landmark event, choosing instead to view it as one among a set of important experiences. Clearly, transgender identity is both so enormously complex and gender such an embedded part of human interaction that there is plenty more to be said, shown, and written about transgender lives. These memoirs dont just show how varied the experiences of trans women can be, but point to transness as a deeply powerful lens through which to view human possibility.

aS"Zella Ziona is the 21st transgender or gender-nonconforming person killed this year in the United States the highest number on record. View this image  Via facebook.com Zella Ziona, a 21-year-old transgender woman, was fatally shot Thursday evening in a suburb outside of Washington, D.C., police officials told BuzzFeed News. Ziona is the 21st confirmed transgender or gender-nonconforming person killed this year the highest number recorded by the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP), which tracks violence against LGBT people. Ziona was shot in the upper body in an alley that separates the Montgomery Village Plaza and the Montgomery Village Crossing shopping centers in Gaithersburg, Maryland, police said. The Montgomery County Department of Police has not identified a suspect. Investigators have been working around the clock on this case, and we are looking at many leads at this stage of the investigation, police Capt. Paul Starks told BuzzFeed News. He added that officers have also not identified a motive including whether the shooting may have been a hate crime motivated by Zionas gender identity. We dont want to rule any possibility out, Starks said. He declined to share additional details of the case, including whether Ziona was targeted, other than describing the case as a homicide. In 2014, 13 transgender women were killed in the U.S. all but two of whom were black or Latina. Of the 21 transgender or gender-nonconforming people killed in homicides in 2015, according to the NCAVP, a disproportionately high number of the victims 18 were people of color. Our transgender sisters continue to be taken from us far too often and at too young an age, said a statement from Ruby Corado of LGBT advocacy group Casa Ruby in Washington, D.C. She was only 21 years old. We demand that the community say her name and stop this violence. Police will not identify Zionas race. However, police referred to a Facebook profile in which she appears to be a woman of color. People have been memorializing Ziona on social media: View on Instagram instagram.com Trans women and LGBT people of color experience a greater risk of homicide than LGBT people as a whole, according to a June report by the NCAVP. The report found hate-motivated violence against LGBT people dropped 32% overall in 2014 compared with the previous year, but hate-motivated violence against transgender people rose 13%. The most recent transgender homicide victim before Ziona was Kiesha Jenkins, 22, who was killed in Philadelphia on Oct. 6. As is common with transgender women who have been killed, Ziona was misgendered in initial reports a pattern that LGBT advocates say can hamper investigations by misidentifying victims and alienating people who could assist the investigation. News articles, TV spots, and a police department press release on Thursday identified Ziona as man and used a male name to describe her despite media showing images of her purse at the scene. Local press said a man stood over Ziona and fired shots at close range, according to a witness who reportedly tried to chase the gunman. An initial call to 911 identified Ziona as a woman, Starks said Friday. However, as Natasha Plotnikov, a spokesperson for the department, told BuzzFeed News, police later identified the victim as male because the identification was [at the scene] and we went by the drivers license. Starks also said that during Zionas media treatment, it was reported back to those at the scene that her gender was male. After deepening the investigation and speaking with family and friends, Starks explained Friday, it was learned that she was a transgender female. Detectives are asking anyone with information about the shooting to contact them at (240) 773-5070. Chai Jindasurat, co-director of public advocacy at the New York City Anti-Violence Project, pointed to the unprecedented rate of homicides of trans women in a statement issued Friday evening. This is a state of emergency for our communities. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .   Hey! This video may have privacy restrictions.
