S"As soon as I said Safe Schools, you could see it in their faces. View this image  Lane Sainty / BuzzFeed A student welfare support worker in a regional area of Australia told BuzzFeed News she had struggled to explain the anti-bullying program to parents after an effective campaign led by conservative media, politicians and lobby groups left the name of the program in the mud. Theyre just scared of what they dont understand, she said. As soon as I said Safe Schools, you could see it in their faces. We dont want our kids indoctrinated. Trying to deal with a lack of understanding and support, several LGBTI students have dropped out of the high school she works in. Weve lost three, one trans student and two same-sex attracted students in the last 18 months because of bullying and misunderstanding in the school, the welfare worker said. One student who left the school was so distressed by the negative media that his mother was also referred to a psychologist as she struggled to support him. He believes the things he hears he says Im a freak, nobody wants me, the student welfare worker said. Hes attempted suicide several times in the past few years. View this image  Safe Schools Coalition A government review into Safe Schools earlier this year dictated schools must get the permission of individual parents and also of the relevant parenting body before the program can be introduced. The requirement was slammed at the time by the parents of transgender children, who must now effectively beg school parenting bodies before their children can receive help. BuzzFeed News understands some schools have privately expressed fear over being publicly identified as a member of the program. In Queensland and NSW, the list of member schools has been removed from public listings due to safety concerns for staff and students. Safe Schools declined to comment on the difficulties experienced in rolling out the program since the review. View this image  Adam Marsters / NEWZULU Last week, NSW MP Damian Tudehope presented a petition of more than 17,000 signatures, largely from the Chinese-Australian community, to state parliament calling for the program to be shut down. Labor MP Penny Sharpe, who has started a counter-petition, told BuzzFeed News the information provided around Tudehopes petition was inaccurate. Sharpe has received several thousand emails about the program, many of which are riddled with errors. One form email incorrectly claims Safe Schools advertises chest-binding and teaches children how gay and lesbian people have sex. Sharpe described it as a gross misconception of the program: Please stop Safe Schools advertising the harmful practice of chest binding on their websites. Please stop Safe Schools encouraging students to cross-dress. Please stop Safe Schools teaching kids gay and lesbian sexual techniques. Please stop Safe Schools encouraging kids to use either boys or girls toilets. Please stop Safe Schools trying to integrate gender theory and sexual themes across all subjects. Others describe Safe Schools as social engineering to make kids gay and transgender, and warn Sharpe to act wisely in fear and honour of God. Ive talked to teachers and students and parents whose kids are involved in schools where Safe Schools is operating and they remain distraught its become a political football, Sharpe said. Whats been lost is that its made an incredibly positive difference in the lives of many students. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The most hateful debate in history. View this image  Torsten Blackwood / AFP / Getty Images Submissions by gay activists to the UN Human Rights Committee throughout the early 90s, provided to BuzzFeed News, show a debate characterised by acrimony and a desire to dehumanise and humiliate LGBT people. Politicians and councillors described gay people as no better than Saddam Hussein, said they sullied society with their evil activities, and encouraged people to call gay men the derogatory term poofs. Government ministers, including prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, have repeatedly said they believe the national debate over marriage equality that a plebiscite would bring will be respectful. Speaking to Lateline on Monday night, attorney-general George Brandis said Australia is well placed to conduct a national conversation about marriage. Ive got enough confidence in the Australian people to believe that it will be a respectful discussion. However, LGBT Australians with memories of Tasmania have serious doubts. Prominent activist and former head of Australian Marriage Equality, Rodney Croome, told BuzzFeed News Tasmania was host to the most protracted and hateful LGBT rights debate in Australian history. View this image  Lukas Coch / AAPIMAGE Tasmanian senator Eric Abetz was first elected in 1994, the same year that the UN found Tasmanias anti-gay laws breached Australias international human rights obligations. In a speech to parliament at the time, Abetz stated his opposition to the proposed decriminalisation of homosexuality, saying it could lead to inadvertently legalising incest, and that the UN should not dictate Tasmanias moral standards. The question arises: who is best suited to determine the moral code of Tasmanians? Abetz asked the parliament. Is it the champagne charlies of the United Nations? Is it the unelected people on the Human Rights Commission or ought it be the people of Tasmania? I declare unashamedly my commitment and bias towards democracy as opposed to the thought police of the United Nations. If we are going to rely on this overriding right to privacy, surely incest must be allowed as well, he said. A spokesperson for Abetz told BuzzFeed News he would not comment on the 1997 debate. View this image  Graham Denholm / Getty Images A plethora of comments made by state and local politicians in the late 80s and early 90s show gay people were openly derided and threatened with violence as part of the legislative struggle. In 1988, then-Tasmanian premier Robin Gray said Aboriginal people, the sick and Greenies were welcome in Tasmania, but homosexuals were not interested in. In November 1989, MLC Richard Archer said when I hear a minister of the Crown making reference to the decriminalisation of homosexuality I feel sick in the guts - when I hear these people [homosexuals] talking about human rights, my blood boils. Ulverstone councillor Jack Breheny said in 1991 that representatives of the gay community are no better than Saddam Hussein and convicted murderer Dr Rory Jack Thompson. In 1991, MLC George Brookes suggested to the parliament that laws against homosexuality should be made more draconian in order to convince people to take the plane north. Do not let them sully our state with their evil activities, he added. Brookes also encouraged Tasmanians to call people poofter instead of gay. MLC Hugh Hiscutt commented not a bad idea either in response to gay people being put to death in the times of the Old Testament. View this image  Star Observer / Via starobserver.com.au In 1997, Tasmania became the last Australian state to decriminalise consenting sex between men. Croome said the lesson he learned from that long debate is that a marriage equality plebiscite would not be respectful. When I say the plebiscite will be a platform for hate and young people will lose their lives, its not rhetoric, it comes straight from my personal experience, he said. Last week, many people shared a Facebook post from comedian Hannah Gadsby, in which she detailed her experience of being a gay teenager in Tasmania in the 90s. The things that were said led her to hate myself so deeply, she wrote. Her sentiments are reflected among the wider LGBT community, with recent polling finding 85% of LGBT people oppose the plebiscite. Among LGBT Tasmanians, the number is even higher: 92%. Many would rather wait years for equality than sit through another debate of that scale. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS'Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton joined by 12 others states officials on Wednesday urged a federal judge in North Carolina to put challenges to that states anti-transgender law on hold for now. View this image  Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton Kirk Irwin / Getty Images WASHINGTON Texas and 12 other states injected themselves on Wednesday into the ongoing legal battles over North Carolinas anti-LGBT law by asking a federal judge to put those lawsuits on hold for now. The law, HB 2, was passed earlier this year, and one of the provisions the subject of several lawsuits limits public restroom usage to peoples biological sex, using a definition that targets transgender people unable to get their birth certificate changed to reflect their gender identity. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, joined by 10 other state attorneys general and two governors, specifically asked U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Schroeder to put the Justice Departments pending challenge to that law on hold while other cases proceed. The Obama administration has asked Schroeder to halt enforcement of the anti-transgender provision, and he heard arguments over that request on Aug. 1. Putting the cases on hold as Paxton and the other states officials asked in the unusual filing on Wednesday (or denying the Obama administrations request, a move the brief also supports) would mean that the anti-transgender law would remain in effect for the time being. Paxton and the state officials cite an injunction issued in the case that Texas and several other states brought against the Obama administrations pro-transgender policies as a key reason for judge in North Carolina to issue a stay in that case despite the fact that the injunction issued in the Texas case specifically exempted previously initiated litigation from that order. The legal fight that has erupted over transgender restroom usage in the past few years has, generally, taken three forms of cases: those filed by individuals challenging anti-transgender policies; those filed by states or state officials challenging the Obama administrations position that existing civil rights laws protect transgender people from discrimination; and those filed by the federal government challenging anti-transgender actions, policies, or laws. U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Schroeder, hearing several of the many challenges to the North Carolina law, issued a narrow injunction this past week in a case brought by students and employees of the University of North Carolina against the state and university. In the injunction, he ordered the school and government not to enforce the part of HB 2 that limits public restroom usage to peoples biological sex but only as to the people who brought the lawsuit. A big part of Schroeders decision was based on a prior decision of the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals where appeals from federal courts in North Carolina are heard holding that the Obama administrations interpretation that Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 protects transgender people from discrimination is a permissible interpretation of the regulations implementing that law. The school district in that case Gloucester County School Board v. G.G. currently is seeking Supreme Court review of the 4th Circuits decision. Schroeder has not, however, yet ruled on the more broad request by the Justice Department to halt all enforcement of that anti-transgender provision in HB 2. The move by Paxton and the other state officials on Wednesday of asking to file a brief before Schroeders court opposing the Obama administrations request was unusual because it came nearly a month after Schroeder held arguments in the matter. Paxton was joined on the brief by the attorneys general of Arkansas, Arizona, West Virginia, Alabama, Wisconsin, Georgia, Nebraska, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Utah as well as the governors of Kentucky and Mississippi. While ostensibly an opposition to the Justice Departments request for an injunction, the brief also was unusual because the state officials used it to urge Schroeder to put the North Carolina cases on hold pressing the arguments that prevailed in front of the judge in Texas before Schroeder in North Carolina and arguing to Schroeder that the injunction should influence what he does next in the cases before him. While the Injunction [in the Texas case] does not specifically prevent DOJ from continuing this litigation, the state officials note, and this Court has acknowledged the same referencing Schroeders order from this past week it nonetheless supports staying these proceedings until the Supreme Court decides whether to hear the appeal of the Gloucester case and until the 4th Circuit addresses an appeal of Schroeders injunction regarding the individual plaintiffs and UNC. Additionally, Paxton and the other state officials argue that the injunction in the Texas-led federal challenge supports denying the [injunction] requested by the Justice Department. Indeed, now that the federal policies at issue are subject to a nationwide injunction, will be inspected again by the Fourth Circuit, and also scrutinized by the Supreme Court, granting the United States preliminary injunction motion would bestow upon North Carolina the distinction of making it the only State unable to enforce its policy regarding access to intimate areas, the brief argues. The same group of state officials sought to file a brief in one other case on Wednesday, supporting the Highland Local School Districts school board in Ohio in its request for a preliminary injunction against the Education Department.

View this image  View this image  Luxy told Gay Star News that he was held by security at Doha airport on July 6 due to issues with his visa. He said that while he was detained, officials looked through his phone and then arrested him for indecency, cybercrime, and allegations of being gay. The Instagram star does not identify as gay. View on Instagram View on Instagram View on Instagram View on Instagram He said he believes the Qataris did not relay news of his arrest back to his home country. After eventually being located, he said, he was given a lawyer and then released. However, the Polish embassy in Doha told BuzzFeed News that Luxy was not arrested on charges of being gay and that he was never reported as missing. The embassy also said that when interviewed by Polish consular staff in prison, Luxy never complained about the conduct of police officers and he felt the conditions of his arrest were fair. Their full statement is below: A Polish national nicknamed Luxy, aged 18, was detained at Hamad International Airport in Doha on 06 July 2016 on a charge of money extortion, blackmail and assault on a Qatari nationals privacy on line (cyber-related offense) not of being homosexual or due to a minor visa irregularities. His arrest has not been reported to the Polish consular services by the Qatari Police (which is by and large a standard practice in Qatar), until the detainees family information received a week after the actual detention. Polish consular service has never reported Mr Luxy missing. I visited the detainee in jail (remand over Criminal Investigation Department, not a prison) several times and found the arrest conditions decent and correct, what was also the opinion of the detainee. No irregular behaviour of any Police officer was reported to me by the detainee. Eventually Luxy was released in mid-August on bail and allowed to leave Qatar national territory although, to my knowledge, the investigation is still underway.

aS"Federal officials will not say if they will continue to investigate complaints from transgender workers while an Aug. 21 injunction is in place. On Tuesday, the Justice Department asked the court for some clarity on that injunction. View this image  Attorney General Loretta Lynch AP / Manuel Balce Ceneta On August 21, a federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked the federal government from enforcing guidance and rules based on Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 that protect transgender students in public schools. That decision did not go as far as Texas and 11 other states behind the lawsuit wanted. They had requested a preliminary injunction that also would suspend policies and guidance under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that protect transgender workers. But the judges order didnt mention Title VII or workers just Title IX and schools. That might seem to settle the matter: The government cannot enforce its guidance in schools or in litigation resulting from that school guidance, the thinking goes, but it could enforce its rules when a transgender employee alleges discrimination in a workplace. But now, more than a week since US District Court Judge Reed OConnor issued his order, there is growing uncertainty about how the federal government will proceed. At the heart of the problem, according to Ezra Young, a staff attorney at the Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund (TLDEF), is that the language in Judge OConnors injunction could be read fairly broadly. It unclear as to which laws and agencies it attempts to enjoin enforcement of, Young told BuzzFeed News. We believe clarification is needed. For example, OConnor writes that the injunction shall be binding on Defendants and the defendants include agencies that deal with employment, such as the Department of Labor and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In addition, OConnors order bans the agencies from asserting the guidelines carry weight in court in cases initiated after his order, but Young said it is unclear if those guidelines concern only policies in schools or also in workplaces. Young said early Tuesday that he expected government lawyers to ask the court for clarification as to which defendants are enjoined and which issues are covered by injunction whether it is just Title IX or whether it goes further than Title IX. On Tuesday evening, the Justice Department did file a file a notice asking for clarification, but only insofar as to ask OConnor to make it clear beyond any doubt that they are free to proceed with a list of cases that the department determined are related to, but distinct from, the Texas litigation. Detailing its view of the limits set by OConnor in the injunction, Justice Department lawyers then state that they believe that the cases listed fall outside the scope of these prohibitions meaning that the department believes it should be free to continue litigating those cases. On the larger question of the injunction itself, the Justice Department added in Tuesday nights filing that it expect[s] to file a motion seeking relief with respect to the Courts preliminary injunction. It did not, however, give any timeline as to when it will do so. BuzzFeed News earlier had asked the Department of Justice and EEOC, which oversees enforcement of civil rights law in workplaces, whether they would continue to investigate complaints from transgender workers and enforce their interpretation of Title VII. The Justice Department did not answer the question, and the question of investigating new potential cases was not addressed in Tuesdays filing. A spokesperson for the EEOC, Kimberly Smith-Brown, did respond, but only said that the agency is currently reviewing the [judges] order and assessing its implications. That evasion is at odds from the EEOCs outspoken positions over the past several years. It first found that Title VIIs ban on sex discrimination prohibits transgender discrimination in 2012, then later expanded that specifically to include such things as restroom usage. But Paul Castillo, a lawyer for Lambda Legal, which had filed a brief in the case supporting the transgender protections, told BuzzFeed News that his view of OConnors order is that the agencies can still enforce rules for transgender workers. The judges order doesnt stop them from investigating and and processing complaints under Title VII, he said, adding that the EEOC can continue business as usual. The Texas Attorney Generals Office, asked about the scope of the judges order, also said it only directly concerns schools, governed by Title IX. This order does not address Title VII, said spokesperson Kayleigh Lovvorn. There could, however, be an effect on workplace cases, she said, because courts consider case law interpreting Title IX when evaluating a case concerning Title VII. Thus, the injunction will impact Title VII adjudications. The EEOC has been at the legal vanguard to argue that existing civil rights law protects transgender people. In the past four years, it has accepted complaints and filed litigation against employers that it found discriminated on the basis of gender identity. And in 2014, then-Attorney General Eric Holder said the Justice Department would maintain the same position in its litigation. If the EEOC is halting that work for now, the impact could affect cases between two private parties not just those cases that rely on government participation. This is why: Before a worker can sue an employer under federal civil rights law, the agency details, he or she must first file a complaint with the EEOC and obtain a Notice-of-Right-to-Sue letter. Asked if the EEOC would continue, in the wake of the Texas court ruling, to accept complaints and issue right-to-sue letters to workers alleging gender-identity discrimination so those workers could pursue lawsuits on their own, Smith-Brown did not comment. Young, the TLDEF attorney, said, Our understanding is that the EEOC, like the other defendants in the litigation, is seeking clarification on what the injunction means. That is very likely why they are declining to answer questions about the right-to-sue letter. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

Lauras always talked about her overprotective dad and you get to see that and peer into the telescope of her growing-up life, Bauman told BuzzFeed.

Three is being treated like a Shakespeare play with three acts, so a big chunk of episodes will be released in three parts. Act I will drop Sept. 15, followed by Act II on Sept. 29 and the final act will be released on Oct. 13. Theyll always show up on the KindaTV YouTube channel. View this image  Carmilla has always featured LGBT characters and romance, but the show doesnt make a big deal about it. But this season thats changing. Its always been the normalcy in the school, which is so fantastic, but this year its really talked about, said Bauman. Like, theyre actually going to use the word lesbian. (!!) Now were really unabashedly a queer show, said Negovanlis. On the way to day one! @carmillaseries #letslafongo I love LaFs storyline this year, its one of my fave parts of the season, said Bauman. We really get a deeper understanding of why they are the way they are and their own journey in the world. Its really neat to see this [non-binary] character be super amazing and heroic, added Negovanlis. In fact, they said were going to get a deeper look at all the characters, so expect some emotional screentime with all your faves.

Its always been talked about in reference but you get to experience it as a viewer, said Bauman. View this image  We did learn how to fight, said Negovanlis.

Theres a rollercoaster of emotions we can expect to go through this year, said Negovanlis. As you can imagine, being stuck with your ex in a small space can bring out a lot of feelings. There was definitely a lot of epic crazy stuff that happened at the end of Season 2 and a lot of betrayal and trust lost, said Bauman. Season 1 was all about falling deeply in love all of a sudden, and then Season 2 was about what happens when you see things you dont like about the other person, she added. Season 3 is about accepting the person and its just about a deeper level of love I think. View this image  My conclusion is: . See you on Sept. 15, Creampuffs!

aS"I feel like I cant speak up for myself anymore. View this image  Ema O'Connor / BuzzFeed HOUSTON Many LGBT students at the University of Houston say they feel like they can no longer express themselves safely now that a law allowing people to carry concealed weapons on campus is in effect and classes have begun.I feel like I cant speak up for myself anymore, Robyn Foley, 22, a transgender and intersex student who majors in anthropology, told BuzzFeed News. I cant correct someone on my pronouns Robyns pronoun is they I cant stand up for my transgender friends, because if I do and someone gets pissed off all they have to do is pull out a gun. A number of other students eating lunch at the campus LGBTQ Resource Center nodded in agreement. School stresses us out enough without us having to worry about the people who already yell at us for being sinners, added Michael Allen, 29, an arts major with green hair. On Aug. 1, just before the start of classes at the state school, Senate Bill 11 known as the campus carry law went into effect, allowing students at state universities in Texas who have licenses to carry concealed handguns to bring those guns anywhere on campus, with the exception of exclusion zones. These zones include the majority of dorms though some rooms in the dorms are not exclusion zones as well as some research centers and other buildings containing classrooms, and any religious centers, day care centers, and health centers. The building containing the LGBT center, as well as the veteran students center, is not an exclusion zone, which many of the students in the LGBT center didnt realize until someone looked it up during a conversation with BuzzFeed News. The students sat in stunned silence for a moment before Foley said, Wow, I just assumed it was, out of common sense. Thats actually really scary, another student, who went by K, added. (K asked not to have their full name included because they havent yet told their parents about their gender identity.) Guns must remain concealed at all times, but Allen told BuzzFeed News he had already seen a man with a gun visible on his belt in the parking lot. Some students said that the fact that the guns cant be seen makes it even more intimidating. Anyone you get into a philosophical argument with in class might have his hand on his gun while youre talking, one student, who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation, told BuzzFeed News. I already feel it affecting my education. Ema O'Connor / BuzzFeed Robyn Foley, left, and Michael Allen at the University of Houstons LGBT Resource Center. Some of the students thought about protesting, but they didnt think it would be safe. We would also out ourselves in the process, which isnt safe for many of the LGBT students on campus, Foley added. Especially now. Last week, students at the University of Texas at Austin held a large protest against the campus carry laws. Hundreds of students waved dildos and held signs reading Cocks Not Glocks. So far no protests have occurred on UHs campus. K added that when the law was passed last year, the administration promised to provide resources to increase a feeling of safety on campus such as areas for people to check their weapons before going into the exclusion zones. I havent seen a single one of those yet, they said. Elizabeth Gregory, the director of UHs gender and sexuality studies department, told BuzzFeed News that many faculty members shes spoken with have been concerned about how campus carry will affect class discussions, particularly in her department, where many of the subjects covered in their classes are controversial to begin with. The whole point of being at university is being able to speak your mind, she said. This dampens that because people never know what the person next to them might be thinking about what they are saying. She added that she and her department have had discussions about taking action, though no specific plans have taken shape. She believes this is mainly because UHs campus community is less tight-knit than UT Austins. I think the community was hoping there would be some reason [campus carry] would be taken off the table, Gregory said. Now we have to come to terms with it as a reality. Ethan in the University of Houston Student Center North. Ema O'Connor / BuzzFeed University of Houston Student Center North Ema O'Connor / BuzzFeed Many of the LGBTQ students told BuzzFeed News they regularly experienced intimidation on campus before the law was implemented both from fellow students and from non-student religious protest groups on campus, which the students refer to as Hell Yellers. Many non-student religious groups, including one called Bulldog Ministries, show up on UHs campus during midterms and finals and yell at students, the students at the LGBT center told BuzzFeed News.On Bulldogs website, men can be seen in various locations in Houston holding signs reading, WARNING: drunks, homosexuals, abortionists, adulterers, liars, fornicators, thieves, atheists, witches, idolaters, HELL AWAITS YOU. Because of UHs freedom of expression policy, the group is allowed to remain in certain areas on campus as long as they dont physically assault anyone. But Allen and Foley said they have watched the groups push people protesting their protests. Bulldog didnt immediately return a request for comment. Allen said he was more worried about these groups being able to carry guns on campus than he is about UHs students. These people come here with the purpose of spreading hate, they come here looking for conflict, Allen said. Thats what worries me really. Neither the UH administration nor the UH police press office immediately responded to BuzzFeed News request for comment. View this image  The University of Houstons LGBTQ, Women and Gender Resource Center. Ema O'Connor / BuzzFeed Ethan, 19, a trans student who identifies as male, told BuzzFeed News that before the campus carry law he was already worried about using the mens bathroom and having someone say, You dont look right, you dont belong here. Now those people might have guns, he added. Foley said they have had slurs yelled at them and been intimidated on campus before. Other LGBT students said they have had similar experiences. Many of the students said that despite not wanting the guns on campus, they were comfortable around guns, or even loved them. I grew up around guns, Ethan said. My parents had them for protection. But having them in a college environment was just different, he said. Foley said that they also grew up around guns, and that their boyfriend of nearly five years keeps a gun on their beside table every night. But this doesnt stop Foley from fearing the actions of their peers. But the good thing is, maybe this will make our campus start paying more attention to local politics, Allen said. Maybe this campus will actually start voting. 5. Texas House Passes Bill Allowing Concealed Guns Inside Colleges buzzfeed.com  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Please dont hector me. Anglican priest Ian Powell approached Shorten outside a church service for MPs this morning in Canberra, saying he liked the Labor party but was disappointed by Shortens comments. ABC News posted footage of the awkward interaction on Twitter. OL @billshortenmp bailed up by a priest over his views on gay marriage. Latest on the blog https://t.co/Z0b17shjXR https://t.co/hj32e2RmJ5 Powell: You described people who werent in favour of changing the definition of marriage as haters who come out from under rocks. Can I ask you not to speak like that? Because I know lots of people like that. Shorten: I dont mean to interrupt you youre asking me Powell: Please dont speak like that abut other Australians so we can have a civil and tolerant discussion rather than the hate speech coming from our prospective prime minister. Shorten: If youre going to quote me, quote me accurately. Powell: Well thats how you were quoted. Tell me what you said then, Ill be glad if I was wrong. Shorten: Please dont hector me. Give me the chance to speak. Powell: Go, go go. Shorten: Thank you for that. First of all, people of faith can be opposed to marriage equality. Powell: Its not about faith. Its just a point of view. Shorten: If youve got more to say Ill listen to you. Powell: Thank you. Shorten: People of faith can be opposed to marriage equality but some people who object to marriage equality do have homophobic attitudes. Powell: Of course. Thank you. Powell was referencing comments made by Shorten in a debate prior to the election. The context of the haters who come out from under rocks quote is Shorten saying the marriage plebiscite could fuel homophobia. I dont want to give the haters a chance to come out from underneath the rock and make life harder for LGBTI people or their families, to somehow question the legitimacy of their relationship, Shorten said at the time. Powell slammed Shorten as taking cheap, nasty, untruthful shots instead of modeling intelligent, respectful tolerance. Of course there are haters on both sides, he told reporters. In a 2012 lecture on homosexuality and Christianity, Powell likened being gay to having a strong attraction to animals. Ive met people whose deep innate longings is to have sex with animals. They struggle. This guy I was talking to he felt it deeply as any other sexual longing. As much as I wanted to have sex with women, he wanted to have sex with animals. Thats just the way he found himself. Why does he not do it? He understands that that is not what the Bible says. Powell also said the term homosexual is unhelpful, offering same-sex attracted and same-sex attraction activity and lifestyle as better ways to discuss homosexuality. SSA is a non judgmental thing, they are attracted to people of the same sex, he said. [SSAAL] is a different thing, people who say Yes I am attracted to the same sex and I will act on that and it will become part of my lifestyle. In comments on Facebook last year, Powell also argued that same-sex marriage would lead to group marriages. I am happy to have a large bet that once we do redefine it then very soon we will have all sorts of pushes to redefine the redefinition that will be impossible to ignore, he wrote.

aS"The Gloucester County School Board is asking the justices to reverse a lower court decision in favor of a transgender student. View this image  Mandel Ngan / AFP / Getty Images WASHINGTON The Virginia school district seeking to limit restroom use to peoples biological sex effectively barring transgender students from using the restroom that corresponds with their gender identity on Monday asked the US Supreme Court to hear its appeal. The Gloucester County School Board asked the high court to take the case and reverse an appeals court decision that sided with a transgender student and the Obama administration. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court issued an order allowing the school to keep its policy in place while the justices decide whether to hear the appeal. If the justices agree to hear the appeal, per the earlier order, the courts order allowing the policy to stay in place will remain in effect until the justices reach a decision in the case. The student, Gavin Grimm, is represented by the ACLU. The Obama administration, through interpretation of existing laws and regulations, has determined that the sex discrimination ban in Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 includes a ban on anti-transgender discrimination. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals held that the administrations interpretation was a permissible interpretation, leading the district court in Grimms case to issue an injunction against Gloucester schools. The Supreme Courts order, however, stayed that injunction for the time being meaning Grimm, and any other transgender student, could not use the restroom that accords with their gender identity. The lawyers for the school district frame the case as one not about transgender rights, but rather one about agency behavior in setting policies such as the Title IX interpretation advanced by the Obama administration. [T]his case is not really about whether G.G. should be allowed to access the boys restrooms, nor even primarily about whether Title IX can be interpreted to require recipients to allow transgender students into the restrooms and locker rooms that accord with their gender identity, the school boards lawyers write. Fundamentally, this case is about whether an agency employee can impose that policy in a piece of private correspondence. In addition to the Virginia lawyers from Harman, Claytor, Corrigan & Wellman which has been representing the school district the legal team representing Gloucester schools now has expanded to include some of the leading national lawyers fighting the administrations pro-transgender policies. Kyle Duncan is listed as the counsel of record in the case, and he is joined on the brief by his law partner, Gene Schaerr, as well as St. Louis lawyers from the James Otis Law Group, Jonathan Mitchell and D. John Sauer. Once briefs are filed responding to the school boards Monday filing, the justices generally schedule a private vote on whether to hear the case. The current composition of the Supreme Court it has operated with only eight justices since Antonin Scalias death in February could become a key factor in what happens next with the case. It takes four justices to grant the certiorari petition and hear an appeal. It takes five votes, however, to reach a majority opinion. If the court accepted the case, and split down ideological grounds 44, the lower courts decision in favor of Grimm and the administration would be left in place but no national precedent would be set by the case.

aS"A narrow ruling granting a preliminary injunction to those who sued after passage of North Carolinas HB 2. View this image  A unisex sign and the We Are Not This slogan are outside a bathroom at Bull McCabes Irish Pub on May 10, 2016 in Durham, North Carolina. Sara D. Davis / Getty Images In a limited ruling on Friday afternoon, a federal judge barred the University of North Carolina from enforcing the bathroom bill provision of the states anti-LGBT HB 2 law against those transgender individuals who sued the state following the passage of the law. In the ruling U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Schroeder noted, Ultimately, the record reflects what counsel for Governor [Pat] McCrory candidly speculates was the status quo ante in North Carolina in recent years: some transgender individuals have been quietly using bathrooms and other facilities that match their gender identity, without public awareness or incident. The case was brought by the ACLU and Lambda Legal on behalf of several North Carolina residents, including professors and students at UNC schools. After reviewing the record in the case and relevant case law, Schroeder concluded a preliminary injunction of part of the law was appropriate. Specifically, he pointed to a case (G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board) in which the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals from which appeals from North Carolina are heard held that the Obama administrations interpretation of Title IXs sex discrimination provision as including anti-transgender discrimination was permitted. Part Is wholesale ban on access to facilities is inconsistent with DOEs guidance on Title IX compliance under G.G., Schroeder concluded. Accordingly, the court will enjoin UNC from enforcing Part I against the individual transgender Plaintiffs until the court reaches a final decision on the merits in this case, Schroeder concluded. He ruled that plaintiffs did not make the same case that they were likely to succeed on an equal protection challenge to the law and did not rule at this time on their due process-related claim. Finally, he also noted that this injunction returns the parties to the status quo ante as it existed in Title IX facilities prior to Part I [of HB 2]s passage in March 2016.

aS'Jay Timmons and Rick Olson thought theyd have no legal trouble using a surrogate to birth their son. Then a rogue judge in Wisconsin pulled them into an 11-month legal battle. View this image  Jay Timmons (left) and Rick Olson (right) with their three children. Courtesy Jay Timmons and Rick Olson Jay Timmons and Rick Olson, a married gay couple from Virginia, didnt think theyd have any trouble becoming the legal parents of the baby boy their surrogate, a Wisconsin woman, delivered for them last year. They had gotten the frozen embryo that became their son as a gift from straight friends whose in vitro fertilization created more embryos than they could use. They had chosen a Wisconsin surrogate specifically because the states Supreme Court had upheld surrogacy, and other same-sex couples had had smooth sailing there. And by just about any measure, the two intended fathers were prime parent material: They both had good jobs, they had been together for 25 years, and they were already raising two daughters from previous surrogacies. But their careful plans went awry the month before their son, Jacob, was born, when their effort to be named his legal parents landed before a conservative judge who saw surrogacy as a form of human trafficking. Over the next 11 months, the couples bizarre legal battle cost more than $400,000 and kept them in constant terror of losing their son. We didnt have one nights peace, Timmons, 54, a conservative Christian and president of the National Association of Manufacturers, told BuzzFeed News. Wed wake up absolutely panicked, around 2 in the morning, and talk about the fact that we didnt know what was going to happen. The couple took out second and third mortgages to cover the legal fees, and Olson, 49, quit his job as a federal lobbyist for Capital One to manage the proceedings. Over the last couple of years, a handful of high-profile surrogacy lawsuits have cropped up in U.S. courts. In California, a surrogate named Melissa Cook refused a mans wishes to abort one of the triplets she was carrying for him. And in a Pennsylvania, The View co-host Sherri Shepherd tried, unsuccessfully, to pull out of a contract with a pregnant surrogate after splitting up with her husband. But the Wisconsin case is likely unprecedented, legal experts say, in that the surrogate, her husband, and the intended parents were all happy with their arrangement. Only the judge was not. The case was a judicial hijacking, Melissa Brisman, a surrogacy lawyer in New Jersey, told BuzzFeed News. Were at a time when a lot of people are still very committed to the idea that family values means straight married couples who have sex are the only ones who should have babies. In June the couple won the case, thanks in large part to the judges abrupt resignation. Although the proceedings had played out in closed court, once it was over, supporters of Timmons and Olson provided copies of court transcripts, briefs, and filings to BuzzFeed News. And although the case is certainly an anomaly among the thousands of surrogacy arrangements made in the US every year, it underscores how, in certain areas of the country, surrogacy has become a flashpoint for cultural debates about same-sex marriage, reproductive rights, and the booming fertility industry. Dane County Circuit Court Judge Jim Troupis, appointed by Gov. Scott Walker last year, opened his March opinion with the statement, Human trafficking comes in many forms. And although he went on to describe the two dads as a spectacular set of parents who would raise the child in a nurturing environment with unmatched financial resources, he made it clear that he was bothered by the fact that the couple had paid a woman to carry a baby who was not related to them. The fundamental fact remains that another couple has provided the child as a gift to the petitioners, and the child has no genetic relationship to the petitioners, Troupis wrote. In order to bring the child into world, the petitioners have paid a significant amount of money. Without those payments there would be no child. Surrogacy is unquestionably expensive: Even before they ran into trouble and began accruing bills from a dozen different lawyers, the Virginia men paid $35,000 to their surrogate and another $12,500 to the Wisconsin agency that arranged their contract. Some people see these arrangements as selling babies, or exploiting poor womens bodies. But others, including many feminists, say women should be able to use their bodies as they please. There is no federal law on the subject, and state laws vary enormously. California, for example, where Timmons and Olson hired the surrogates who delivered their two daughters, is the center of the nations surrogacy industry, thanks to a friendly state law. But most states dont have any surrogacy laws on the books. Some simply refuse to enforce surrogacy contracts. Others, including Virginia, dont allow surrogacy unless at least one of the intended parents has a genetic connection to the baby. New York and Washington allow only unpaid, or altruistic surrogacy, and Michigan has criminal penalties for all types. Were not getting any closer to a national consensus on the subject, Naomi Cahn, a family law professor at the George Washington University Law School, told BuzzFeed News. And its not just a split between red states banning it and blue states supporting it. Despite the legal limbo, because of the rise of in vitro fertilization now responsible for nearly 2% of US births and the legalization of same-sex marriage, demand is also rising for surrogates. And, partly to avoid legal snags, these women are generally gestational surrogates, meaning that they carry embryos that are not genetically related to them. According to the CDC, there were 3,432 gestational surrogates in 2013, up from 727 in 1999. View this image  A petri dish containing an embryo at the IVF lab at New York Universitys Langone Fertility Center. Jared Harrell for BuzzFeed News Timmons and Olson say they were not thinking much about adding to their family until their friends asked if they wanted their two leftover frozen embryos (only one of which survived). The California surrogacy agency that had helped the two men get their daughters was no longer in business. So they researched the various state laws and chose Wisconsin because it allowed same-sex marriage and had a state Supreme Court ruling upholding surrogacy contracts where they are in the best interests of the child. The Wisconsin proceedings started smoothly. Their agency, Pink and Blue Surrogacy and Fertility of Waterloo, found them a surrogate. And before Jacob was born, Judge Sarah OBrien, who was filling in to cover a vacancy on the county court, issued an interim order giving them parental rights, which would become permanent once the baby was born and had a birth certificate. Jacob was born Aug. 17, 2015, but by that time, the case had been transferred to Judge Troupis, who had recently been appointed to the court. He nixed Judge OBriens order, and appointed an independent lawyer to represent Jacobs interests in the proceedings. Although the case was in Dane County, the liberal stronghold that contains Madison, Judge Troupis appointed as the childs legal guardian Mark Knutson, a lawyer 70 miles away whose radio broadcast, The Word on The Law, aims to reconcile Gods word with the law. Knutson, in turn, brought in another lawyer from his firm, Erik Krueger, who had worked with Liberty Counsel, a group that defends public officials like Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Timmons and Olson were for the most part allowed to keep Jacob at their home in Virginia, although at one point, Timmons had to stay in Wisconsin with Jacob while Olson and the girls returned to Virginia for the start of the school year. Rather than following the first judges lead, and formalizing the couples parentage rights on Jacobs birth certificate, Knutson insisted on full-bore legal proceedings. Instead of conducting informal interviews with Timmons, Olson, the surrogate, her husband, and officials from the surrogacy agency, Knutson required them all to testify at formal depositions. And while many surrogacy cases in Wisconsin do not involve an independent legal guardian, and those that do usually have fees of less than $1,500, Knutsons bills topped $100,000 to be paid by Timmons and Olson. In November, Knutson filed a 45-page report to Judge Troupis, calling for more court oversight of surrogacy cases and arguing that rubber-stamping a gestational surrogacy contract made by two men with no genetic connection to the child would open the way to a dangerous expansion of the concept of parenthood. Such surrogacy contracts, his report said, broker pregnancy, commodify children, and meet the needs of wealthy intended parents at the expense of the children involved. And, he warned, they stretch the boundaries of parenthood beyond all recognition, almost to the point of creating a world, like the one in Platos Republic, in which all children would be raised communally, with no special connection to their parents. Platos assertion that no child should know its parent, once anathema to American jurisprudence, is not so different from paying for parental rights in this case, Knutson wrote. View this image  Rick Olson holding his son, Jacob. David Bohrer In his March decision, Judge Troupis seemed to rely on many of Knutsons arguments. He terminated the surrogates maternal rights and gave the Virginia men only temporary custody, technically leaving Jacob an orphan. Knutson declined to comment for BuzzFeed News, and Judge Troupis could not be reached through his law office. As news of the case spread, LGBT rights advocates were horrified. This case is an indication of the work thats left to be done, said Emily Hecht-McGowan, director of public policy at the Family Equality Council, an advocacy group that supported Timmons and Olson. Theres a sense in the gay community and among parents at large that now that we have marriage equality, all the issues are resolved, and same-sex couples will be treated like everyone else, but thats not yet true. The Troupis decision left Timmons and Olson at a crossroads: They could continue to appeal in Wisconsin, or take a different route, pursuing an adoption in their home state of Virginia. While they weighed these options from their home in Virginia while caring for Jacob and their young daughters they had a lucky break: Judge Troupis resigned May 2, to try, unsuccessfully, for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Timmons and Olson had already moved to reopen and reconsider Judge Troupiss ruling, but with the judges resignation, their case was transferred to yet another judge, Peter Anderson, who overturned Judge Troupiss faulty opinion, which he criticized for using language that was unduly harsh and kind of weird. Since their victory, Timmons and Olson have spent the summer fighting Knutsons huge legal bills, and going public with their story to try to prevent similar actions by rogue judges elsewhere. Our biggest concern is that you had a judge ignoring the law, ignoring precedent, with intention to take Jacob away, or to torture us, based on his personal opinion, Timmons said. Were using our voices to try to make sure this never happens to another family. CORRECTION Judge Troupis appointed as the childs legal guardian Mark Knutson, who in turn brought in another lawyer from his firm, Erik Krueger. An earlier version of this story swapped the two mens first names.

The 62-year-old man was arrested at a business in Rydalmere in Sydneys west, New South Wales police said in a statement Sunday. Authorities did not name the club, but the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reported the incident occurred at the Aarows bathhouse, which is described on its website as a secure, relaxed environment where gay and bi people can meet and socialize together 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Following previous similar incidents at the club, dispensers were fitted with alarms to alert security officers when tampered with, police said. Police will allege an alarm sounded and security detained the man before police [arrived], officers said. No serious injuries were reported. The man was charged with administering poison intending to injure/cause distress/pain, entering a building with intent to commit an indictable offense, malicious damage, and driving with a suspended license.

aS"It is the first time the National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce has endorsed in a presidential race. View this image  AP / Carolyn Kaster The largest LGBT business association in the United States voted this week to endorse a presidential candidate for the first time in its history choosing Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump.The LGBT community has come too far to lose its seat at the table, Chance Mitchell, the National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerces co-founder and CEO, said in a statement to BuzzFeed News.Several LGBT groups have shown an affinity for Clinton, including the Human Rights Campaign, which endorsed her in January. However, Fridays endorsement from the 15-year-old business group comes amid and despite Trumps pronounced recent overtures to LGBT voters. Trump has proposed that his hardline policies on immigration would protect LGBT communities from terrorism. And he has long charged that he is a better candidate for American business.In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Clinton welcomed the endorsement and took a swing at her opponent.The stakes in this election could not be higher for LGBT Americans, Clinton said. When Donald Trump says hell make America great again, thats code for take America backwards. He has said he would appoint judges who would overturn marriage equality.The board of the LGBT chamber of commerce which represents roughly 1.4 million LGBT business owners and has about 150 corporate and government partners approved its resolution unanimously at a conference this week in Palm Springs, California. In its resolution, the group praised Clinton for denouncing LGBT discrimination as not only morally wrong, but fundamentally destructive for business. The resolution rejected Trumps policies, saying he has vowed to revoke LGBT inclusive executive orders on his first day in office.Clinton added that Mike Pence, the Indiana governor running for vice president with Trump, signed a law to protect private businesses that cite their faith when deciding to provide, or withhold, services. (Pence later signed a law that said the previous law could not be used to discriminate.) Clinton also cited an anti-LGBT law passed this year in North Carolina, saying it has caused companies to pull jobs and millions of dollars out of the state. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"We must avoid having a segregated system. View this image  Charles Mcquillan / Getty Images The Sunday Telegraph reported that the draft question under consideration by the government is, Do you approve of a law to permit people of the same sex to marry? The former Democrat senator told BuzzFeed News there are problems with the phrasing. It suggests the government is not looking to include people in the existing act, it is looking to add an act, he said. We must avoid having a segregated system of parallel marriages, one for straight people and one for non-straight people. Dean of the UNSW Faculty of Law George Williams told BuzzFeed News it would be entirely possible to have a separate law allowing same-sex marriages. There would need to be amendments to the existing Marriage Act, because otherwise it would give rise to inconsistency, he said. If you cleared out those inconsistencies, you could still have separate legislation providing for same-sex marriage. A spokesperson for attorney-general George Brandis did not rule out the possibility. The mechanics of the plebiscite are subject to the usual cabinet processes and no decision has been made, the spokesperson said. However, Williams said he cant see any point to such a proposal. Of course, it might send an unfortunate signal about whether same-sex marriage is on par with other forms of marriage, he said. View this image  Lisa Maree Williams / Getty Images Greig and other advocates have also expressed concern that the draft question does not include all people with the wording same sex. GetUp! campaigner Sally Rugg said the draft question excludes intersex people and people without a binary gender identity through the prescriptive wording same-sex marriage. Williams echoed these concerns, saying the best way to legislate for marriage equality would be not include the words same sex at all. The best way would be to amend the definition of marriage, in the Marriage Act, to make it clear it applies not just to heterosexual couples but marriage generally between two people.

aS"Critics say Gilead wanted to restrict access to the highly effective drug so it could charge a higher price. View this image  Getty Gilead Australia, the maker of Truvada, a once-daily pill that has been shown to be more than 90% effective at preventing the contraction of HIV, had its submission for the drug to be subsidised by the government knocked back last week. Health advocates say Gilead attempted to restrict subsidised access to Truvada used in the HIV prevention regime pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) so it could continue to charge an exorbitant price. The details of Gileads submission are not publicly available, but HIV advocates believe the company asked the government to subsidise the full retail price of the drug, which sells for around $700 a month. They say the company also wanted to restrict access to only people with a higher risk of contracting HIV, but HIV advocates and the Department of Health both say these restrictions were unacceptable. A spokesperson for the Department of Health said Gileads proposed cost for the drug was far too high. [Gileads] attempt to limit PBS subsidy of Truvada to a smaller, high-risk subset of the whole at risk population was not feasible and would not be acceptable to prescribers or consumers, the spokesperson said. President of the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations Dr Bridget Haire told BuzzFeed News that in attempting to protect its profit margins, Gilead had failed to protect the Australians who are most at risk of contracting HIV. View this image  Photodisc / Getty Images We know that you can buy generic Truvada equivalents over the internet for as low as $55 or $60 a month, she said. Its pretty hard to justify charging over $700 a month for the same pill. The case that should have been put to the PBAC [Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Scheme] should have been trying to get access to PrEP for all of the Australians who are going to benefit from it at a price thats going to be affordable for the country. A spokesperson for Gilead told BuzzFeed News that the modelling it provided to the PBAC showed the drug would be cost effective for the government. Health experts also believe the PBAC made its decision based on Gileads outdated assumptions about gay mens willingness to take a pill each day. The PBAC decision noted Truvada is most effective if taken once daily and questioned whether men who engage in risky sexual practices (like having sex without a condom) would be willing and able to adhere to such a regime. But that information is contradicted by multiple studies in Australia and overseas that show extremely high adherence to PrEP by at-risk individuals. View this image  Getty The research that weve done on people taking PrEP shows really high rates of adherence to the daily dosing requirements, Dr Dean Murphy, a research fellow at UNSW, told BuzzFeed News. We see adherence rates of over 90%. So it was very surprising that they would assume and it seems to be an assumption that adherence to daily dosing would be low [just] because adherence to condom use was low among that group. Victorian AIDS Council CEO Dr Simon Ruth said the assumptions that appear to have been made by Gilead were illogical. It is wrong and offensive to assume that gay men would not be taking every measure to protect themselves when it comes to HIV, he said. PrEP demonstration projects have shown gay mens adherence to PrEP is extremely high, and comments like this are unhelpful, stigmatising, and homophobic. Nic Holas, president of the Institute of Many, an advocacy group for people living with HIV, said the PBAC decision showed the greed of pharmaceutical companies like Gilead. Until such a time that PrEP is accessible to all people in Australia who need it, not just want it, it will not be an effective form of HIV prevention at a community-wide level, he said. A Gilead spokesperson told BuzzFeed News the company is reviewing the feedback given to it by PBAC and hopes to resubmit its application for PBS listing in the future.

aS'I am a woman, and I identify as a woman, and you cant make me change in front of someone who I dont identify with, who is physically male. View this image  Sigourney and Aryn Coyle. Margie Peterson/The Morning Call (Licensed) A female cisgender student in Pennsylvania told school officials she will be discriminated against if her high school complies with an Obama administration guideline allowing transgender students to use restrooms and changing rooms that correspond with their gender identity. Sigourney Coyle, who is set to enter ninth grade at Emmaus High School this year, told an East Penn School Board on Monday she did not want to undress in the same changing room as transgender students for religious reasons. I am a woman, and I identify as a woman, and you cant make me change in front of someone who I dont identify with, who is physically male, she said at a meeting on Monday evening, according to video of her testimony uploaded to Facebook by her mother, Aryn Coyle. After the White House issued the guideline, Sigourney Coyle began sitting out of her middle school gym class because she did not feel comfortable using a changing room that transgender students could also use. Facebook: video.php In early May, the Obama administration sent guidelines to public schools warning that funding may be withheld if they do not allow transgender students to use facilities that correspond with their gender identity. The administration has based its directives under its interpretation of Title IX of the Education Act of 1972, which bans discrimination on the basis of sex. On Sunday, a federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked the administrations efforts, issuing a nationwide injunction in response to a lawsuit brought by 11 states that objected to the policies. View this image  Emmaus High School. Google Maps Aryn Coyle did not immediately return requests for comment from BuzzFeed News, but wrote on Facebook in a post that opened with the battle begins that she had tried to send her daughter to school with a letter exempting her from gym class indefinitely based on our religious beliefs. I have always been an advocate of any special arrangement that prevents any group of people from being mistreated based on who they are, she wrote on Facebook. But I will NOT stand by while the law dictates that male bodies are allowed to walk into my daughters locker room, undress next to her, and shower alongside of her. Whether or not the male bodies are covered in pants or skirts is irrelevant. They have no place in her locker room. Aryn Coyle later wrote that the middle school principal had informed her a religious exemption from class only applies to health class due to sexuality content and not gym, and that she will be proud of her daughters possible failing grade in gym. She told the local Morning Call newspaper that neither she nor her daughter were aware of any transgender students in the gym class who had changed locker rooms after the federal government directive. Although, how could you know? Aryn Coyle said. A person who was biologically male could waltz into the bathroom. So she felt very exposed and at risk. View this image  Dan Bellyk / Getty Images/Thinkstock As Sigourney Coyle prepares to now enter high school, she told the school board she fears she will not be able to complete the mandatory gym classes required to graduate. Gym requires us to participate to pass high school and if I dont change I am not allowed to participate, she said. So my options are to let myself be discriminated against or fail gym for not participating and not pass through high school, which would jeopardize my future. The teenager told the school board meeting that an Emmaus High School official had given her permission to take gym class in the summer in a bid to better accommodate her. Although Aryn Coyle wrote on Facebook on Sunday that her daughter was thrilled with the development, she later told the Morning Call this was a band-aid solution. I also feel nothing against transgenders, Sigourney Coyle told the school board. I know some and I dont have anything wrong with them. I would just not like their rights to overrule my own. We are equals. They are not better and I am not better. A spokesperson for the East Penn School District would not discuss Coyles case, but provided BuzzFeed News with the following statement: UPDATE After this story was published, Aryn Coyle told with BuzzFeed News her daughters right to privacy was being threatened. Its not that she had a transgender student in her class that she knew of at the time, Coyle said in a phone interview. Its that the Pennsylvania state code protects every students right to bodily privacy and she felt that anyone could come waltzing in just identifying as transgender. Coyle said she recognized it was unlikely a student would pretend to identify as transgender in order to gain access to a different changing room, as the students parent would need to sign a note for the school. However, she said she was concerned that public restrooms could be targeted by potential abuse by people who are not transgender trying to take advantage of the whole thing. She also said she had no problem with her daughter using the same restroom as transgender girls, because the stalls provided a modicum of privacy. However, she said their Christian faith teaches that the first male before whom her daughter should appear nude should be her husband. I wouldnt want to change in a gym locker room where someone who is physically male is changing. The fact that theyre wearing a dress wouldnt change my level of discomfort, she said. She suggested transgender students be allowed to use the changing rooms early, to avoid being in rooms at the same time as cisgender students. Coyle said she felt proud of her daughter for delivering her speech to the school board. I really stand behind her, she said. Im very proud of her for standing up for what she believes in.

A listing on the PBS would have made the drug widely available, especially to the people most likely to contract HIV: gay men and transgender women on low incomes, sex workers, and injecting drug users. Gilead Australias application to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) to have Truvada included on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) was rejected last Friday. PBAC cited Gileads proposed pricing structure as the main reason for rejecting the submission, and found Gileads attempts to restrict subsidised access to Truvada to people whose behaviour was deemed high risk was unacceptable. PBAC considered that [Gileads] cost-effectiveness estimates were unreliable andthat attempts to restrict the eligible population and limiting access to those with a predicted annual risk of infection of 3% or higher, may not be feasible or acceptable to clinicians and consumers, it said. Australias top HIV body, the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations (AFAO), says Gilead did not consult adequately with it, meaning its submission was doomed from the start. View this image  AFAO CEO Darryl ODonnell told BuzzFeed News that a group of community representatives and clinicians was convened by Gilead for advice, but that advice was ultimately ignored. The consideration by PBAC was ultimately dependent on [Gilead] having put forward a reasonable price and a good argument, and from all the evidence weve seen since the decision has come through, that reasonable price and good argument simply wasnt forthcoming, he said. BuzzFeed News understands a letter sent in April by the AFAO seeking access to Gileads submission so as to better inform the AFAOs own submission was rebuffed by the pharmaceutical giant. The relevant HIV/AIDS organisations were only granted access to the submission after it had been made and when it was too late for those organisations to inform the submission in order to give it a better chance of being accepted. Simon Ruth, CEO of the Victorian AIDS Council, agreed that Gilead had failed to consult adequately. It certainly appears on the available evidence that Gilead pitched the price too high and didnt do the necessary legwork to ensure the submission was approved, he said. A spokesperson for Gilead said the company will work closely with PBAC and community stakeholders before resubmitting to PBAC. Information from a wide range of sources helped inform the submission, and Gilead gave the submission every possible chance of success, the spokesperson said. ODonnell said that as Gilead prepares to resubmit its application, thousands of at-risk Australians will continue to have restricted access to a life-saving drug. View this image  Getty Currently, people at risk of contracting HIV can enrol in clinical trials in NSW, Queensland, Victoria, and the ACT, or can import the drugs at a high cost from overseas. For us to have an ideal form of access we need [Truvada] to be available at scale, and we need that to be available in the ways that were all used to accessing treatment for different conditions, and that means being able to see a doctor then walk into a chemist [and buy the drug], ODonnell said.

aS"These policies are blatant discrimination. A young activist is hoping to put the final nail in the coffin of Canadas ban on blood from sexually active queer men with a human rights challenge. Christopher Karas, 20, has filed a federal human rights complaint against two federal entities over the rules that restrict men whove had sex with other men (MSM) from donating unless theyve been abstinent for one year. View this image  Olivya Leblanc Photography Karas, whos gay, believes the ban discriminates on the grounds of sexual orientation, according to complaint filings obtained by BuzzFeed Canada. In particular, it claims that Karas is being denied a service Canadians commonly believe to be their inalienable right. He is seeking an undisclosed sum for pain and suffering. I saw a need to challenge this and were hoping to do that at the Canadian Human Rights Commission, Karas told BuzzFeed Canada. The deferral period was lowered to one year in June, though it was still five years last time Karas tried to donate. I went in and tried to donate blood and sure enough they refused to take my blood on the basis that Im gay, he said. They make you fill out a questionnaire and it blatantly asks if youre a man whose had sex with another man and I answered truthfully, as anyone should. View this image  Health Minister Jane Philpott donates blood in Ottawa, on Monday, Dec. 14, 2015. Justin Tang / THE CANADIAN PRESS Karas says the policy is based on fear and potential donors should be asked about their behaviours to assess risk, rather than be automatically turned away. The deferral policy also applies to cisgender women whove had sex with men whove had sex with men and treats trans folks as their sex assigned at birth if they havent had genital surgery. These policies are blatant discrimination, said Karas.Blood bans were put in place in response to the HIV crisis of the 1980s. The United States, Australia, and the U.K. also have a one-year deferral period, while other countries have an indefinite ban, or none at all. Advocates have argued that with modern testing and infection rates, the deferral period is based on anti-gay stereotypes, not science. View this image  Pride Toronto Karas lawyer, Toronto-based James Hill, told BuzzFeed Canada the shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando showed how the ban impacts the LGBT community. Orlando is a case where gay people, MSM, would love to donate their blood but because theyve made love within a particular period of time, they cant, said Hill.[Karas] cant even donate his own blood for his own use as a result of this.The complaint was filed with the Commission on August 15, and it typically takes a few weeks for a decision as to whether the case can go forward.This is not Karas first human rights case. He took on his former Mississauga Catholic school board with allegations of discrimination after he tried to start a gay-straight alliance club. That case was settled out of court.

aS"U.S. District Court Judge Reed OConnor issued the preliminary injunction sought by Texas and 10 other states who sued the Obama administration over its transgender rules. View this image  A demonstrator holds a sign against the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance outside an early voting center in Houston in 2015. Pat Sullivan / AP A federal judge in Texas has blocked the Obama administrations federal policies protecting transgender students and workers, issuing a nationwide injunction against enforcement of the policies regarding restroom use.U.S. District Court Judge Reed OConnor in Fort Worth issued the order sought by Texas and 10 other states on Sunday. The states sued the Obama administration in May over its guidelines regarding accommodating transgender students in restrooms and facilities at public schools.The 11 states had asked OConnor to suspend Obamas policies largely an interpretation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 in a hearing held on Aug. 12.Defendants have conspired to turn workplaces and educational settings across the country into laboratories for a massive social experiment, flouting the democratic process, and running roughshod over commonsense policies protecting children and basic privacy rights, the states complaint stated. In his 38-page order, OConnor ruled that the states had standing to bring their lawsuit because the administrations Guidelines are clearly designed to target [their] conduct. The court found that the Obama administrations actions likely violate the Administrative Procedure Act for failing to follow proper notice and comment procedures under the law because, the court found, the policies are legislative and substantive. Additionally, the court found that, under the text of the law, the Obama administrations interpretation is incorrect a ruling that contradicts an earlier decision from the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in a related case challenging a Virginia school districts policies. While the administration argued that the guidance is allowed because the use of the word sex in regulations implementing Title IX is ambiguous, OConnor disagreed. [T]he Court concludes 106.33 is not ambiguous, he wrote. It cannot be disputed that the plain meaning of the term sex as used in 106.33 when it was enacted by DOE following passage of Title IX meant the biological and anatomical differences between male and female students as determined at their birth. Of the administrations guidance purporting to change that plain meaning, then, he added: A definition that confuses instead of clarifies is unpersuasive citing the judge who dissented from the 4th Circuits decision for support. In granting the states request, OConnor issued a nationwide injunction of the guidance, writing that while this injunction remains in place, [the Obama administration is] enjoined from initiating, continuing, or concluding any investigation based on [its] interpretation that the definition of sex includes gender identity in Title IXs prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sex. OConnor also ordered that the administration not use the guidelines or claim that they carry weight in any litigation initiated following the date of this Order. The department is disappointed in the courts decision, and we are reviewing our options, Justice Department press secretary Dena Iverson told BuzzFeed News. Although Iverson would not signal either way, the administration is expected to appeal. Paul Castillo, a Texas-based lawyer with that LGBT advocacy group Lambda Legal, told BuzzFeed News he believes an appeal is widely expected.In the short term, Castillo thinks the injunction will prevent federal officials from threatening to withhold federal education funds from schools that ban transgender students that match their gender identity.However, he added, It will not prevent private attorneys, such as Lambda Legal and the ACLU, from representing transgender students by bringing cases against schools that discriminate against them. He said other LGBT groups could file lawsuits as well. View this embed  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .

aS"Gilead Sciences denied the request of Professor Sheena McCormack to contribute extra supplies of PrEP, the HIV prevention drug regime, for the most at-risk patients. cnafinance Getty One of the worlds largest pharmaceutical companies has refused to supply extra HIV prevention drugs to a British doctor who pleaded with the firm to ensure patients on the major study shes conducting into the drug do not contract the virus. More than 500 people who took part in the PROUD study and are known to be at very high risk of infection from HIV will soon be taken off the drug. Following NHS Englands decision not to fund the treatment, it remains unclear whether the participants will have access to future supplies, despite doctors knowing that around 10% of the study group are statistically likely to become HIV-positive within a year. Professor Sheena McCormack, Britains pre-eminent HIV epidemiologist, asked Gilead Sciences for 2,000 bottles of its drug Truvada which blocks HIV in a prevention regime known as PrEP to bridge the gap until the NHS funding situation is resolved. But the company replied saying it will not fulfil her request. NHS Englands refusal to fund the drug is based on its insistence that responsibility for HIV prevention lies with local councils. This has delayed any potential rollout of PrEP and earlier this month led to a successful high court challenge by the National AIDS Trust against the decision, but NHS England is now appealing. In a statement to BuzzFeed News in response to questions about its decision to refuse McCormacks request, Gilead said it was continuing to engage with PROUD doctors and referred to the uncertainty caused by the commissioning battle. View this image  Professor Sheena McCormack Liz Highleyman / hivandhepatitis.com A current lack of clarity from NHS England/local authorities regarding routine commissioning and longer-term availability of PrEP in England, which we need to consider as part of our commitment to potential PrEP users and to the wider HIV community, have meant that these conversations havent yet resulted in a final decision, said a spokesperson. McCormack told BuzzFeed News she remained in the dark about the companys reasons but had sought clarity and urged it to reconsider. In her original letter to Gilead, McCormack wrote that there was clearly going to be a gap in provision of PrEP, and I am once again seeking your assistance to fill this gap for PROUD participants. The PROUD participants, centres, and supporting communities would be very grateful if Gilead was willing to donate Truvada so that 356 participants could continue PrEP for up to six months. She added: I look forward to hearing from you, and hope that Gilead will be able to continue to support the PROUD participants who have delivered such a successful result for PrEP. Terrence Higgins Trust Terrence Higgins Trust A recent PrEP campaign by the Terrence Higgins Trust. McCormack conducted the PROUD study to investigate the efficacy of using Truvada in a prevention regime called PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis). Unlike condoms, which require self-control in situations when people are most prone to spontaneity, PrEP can be taken as one daily tablet, like the contraceptive pill. The results of this study were so compelling demonstrating that PrEP reduced the risk of infection by 86% and with no evidence of higher rates of other STIs that they are quoted internationally as evidence of the power of the drug, which has been described by the National AIDS Trust as a game-changer in the fight against HIV/AIDS. When the study began, there was a control group of participants who were not given PrEP, but so many of them contracted HIV that that part of the study was halted on ethical grounds. Within the first year, around 10% of those not given the drug became HIV-positive. The fear for doctors running the study therefore is that with hundreds coming off the drug in the next few weeks because NHS England is not making it available dozens will contract the virus by this time next year alone. One of the participants, Harry Dodd, 25, told BuzzFeed News he was deeply concerned about the effect withdrawal of access to PrEP will have on those who volunteered. View this image  Harry Dodd Supplied Its a worry to know that theres a finite supply, he said. PrEP has provided a sense of security that a lot of young gay men my age have never had. Theres an increased risk of HIV [in gay men] and so PrEP removes that fear for the first time, in the same way that the contraceptive pill removes the fear of unwanted pregnancy for women. But worse, he said, was the health risk posed by removing access to the drugs for those in the study: Weve been proven to be a high-risk group and were being taken off the drugs in the knowledge that these drugs stop us getting HIV, which is a bold move for Gilead. When some of the participants inevitably contract HIV, he said, Gilead will have a very interesting case on their hands, and it will be a very upsetting and disconcerting outcome that Gilead will have on their conscience. Justin Sullivan / Getty Images Terrence Higgins Trust Truvada (left), and a campaign image from the Terrence Higgins Trust. Gilead Sciences declined to respond to BuzzFeed News request to explain why it refused McCormacks request for more Truvada. Instead, the company said in a statement: Gilead is aware of the concerns around the provision of Truvada to PROUD study participants and is continuing its engagement with PROUD investigators around its use for pre-exposure prophylaxis Gilead welcomed the decision by the high court that NHSE [i.e. NHS England] can fund PrEP as part of a comprehensive approach to HIV prevention, and is committed to continuing its engagement with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, NHSE and Public Health England on routine PrEP commissioning.

aS"Izzy Cerullo spoke to BuzzFeed Brazil about how she met her fiance, her experience in her sport, and how the viral photo of her kiss can inspire people to be comfortable in their own skin. View this image  Alexander Hassenstein / Getty Images In an interview with BuzzFeed Brazil last week, we learned how number 11 on the Brazilian team felt about her girlfriend, Marjorie Enya, publicly popping the question. View this image  Alexander Hassenstein / Getty Images What did it mean to you for your girlfriend to choose to publicly propose? Izzy Cerullo: It meant everything. The Olympic spirit has everything to do with diversity and respect. Even the Olympic slogan is a new world. So, really, it was to show that the world is changing and that theres more visibility and tolerance, more respect and diversity. And it also shows how we dont have to hide, and that we can be who we really are. Of course youre always faced with negative feedback from the people who are looking for attention. But in reality, [the proposal] wouldnt have gotten that much attention if it had been a straight proposal. At the heart of it, it takes more visibility for there to be more acceptance. Its not something all that out of the ordinary, and it just goes to show that love is love and thats what makes it noteworthy. View this image  Phil Noble / Reuters There are only 43 out gay Olympians in this years games. Do you think that sports are becoming more tolerant, or do you think that the jurys still out? IC: Its still early, because just in the first week of the games a number of athletes in my own league and in the international federation have stayed silent, keeping gay athletes invisible. Theres still this fear that youll lose sponsorships if you admit to being gay. Its ridiculous an athlete has to face off with so many pressures and all the things that can distract him or her from the sport or their performance. Have you faced prejudice within your own sport? IC: No. Ive found that rugby is unique in that its value-based. There are five main rugby values, and respect is one of them. Therefore, since its a sport based so much in its values, it would be nearly impossible to be faced with discrimination. One of the best international rugby referees [Nigel Owens] has come out. Its incredible: Hes the GREATEST of all rugby referees. And there are a number of athletes that are openly gay and are embraced by their clubs some people hardly even remember when youd hear something along the lines of Im not trying to be prejudiced, but And it shows that acceptance is truly alive within the sport of rugby. Ive always felt very accepted. View this image  Alexander Hassenstein / Getty Images How did you and Marjorie get together? IC: She was a selection manager. From the start, people thought that we had a lot in common, and that our priorities were aligned and that our worldviews were similar. We started to take it a little further and we discovered that we truly were both interested in pursuing a relationship. That was 2014. View this image  Alexander Hassenstein / Getty Images IC: We went through a World competition in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. It was a lot more of a conservative culture, the country overall was more conservative, but rugby was safe from that. Within rugby, people dont care. View this image  Phil Noble / Reuters The Brazilian womens rugby team finished in ninth place. What does that mean to you? IC: Three years ago there was the World Tour, which is a series of six rounds around the world with the 12 best teams in the world. And in those years Brazil was a guest team, so to be the host country of the Olympics we need to have more experience against the best teams in the world. Though this time we showed that we can be among the top 10, and our world ranking is 10th. In Latin America we are undefeated we havent yet lost an official game as a team, and weve been the South American champions 11 times. Really, weve come a long way, and our hope is to only continue this development, because this year well have five or six circuit rounds and have the opportunity to continue closing the gap between us and the best.

aS"When Stewart McDonald said he wanted to share a room with his partner, a receptionist asked: Really? Both of you in the same bed? View this image  Stewart McDonald / Via Facebook: StewartMcDonaldSNP A New York hotel has apologised to a gay member of the UK parliament after a receptionist questioned why he would want to share a bed with his partner. Stewart McDonald, the SNP MP for Glasgow South, said the receptionist at the Hotel Pennsylvania in Manhattan appeared uncomfortable with the idea of two men sharing a bed when he and his partner were checking in to a room. McDonald told Pink News that, when checking in to the hotel at the end of a holiday to the United States, he and his partner were asked: Really? Both of you in the same bed? The Glasgow South MP added: I told [the receptionist] Gordon was my partner and he then just stood and stared at us for a few seconds, before proceeding to check us in. He was clearly baffled and uncomfortable with the idea of two men, who are in a relationship, sharing a bed. Speaking to BuzzFeed News, McDonald said he had a meeting with the hotels guest services one day after complaining about the receptionists behaviour on Twitter. In NYC 1 extra night because of JFK shutdown. Checked in to @NYHotelPenn & receptionist questioning why 2 men would want one double bed. McDonald said the managements response to the incident was very fair, adding: I had a meeting with the guest services manager, who very sincerely apologised and talked me through how he is going to ensure it doesnt happen again by initiating some training amongst all staff. However, the Glasgow South MP added: Same-sex couples just shouldnt have to go through this sort of stuff in 2016.

aS"We might be able to actually achieve something. View this image  Sean Davey for BuzzFeed Australia is the only nation in the world that requires transgender teenagers to go through the Family Court before they can access cross-sex hormone treatment. This treatment, which usually begins around age 15 or 16, entails transgender children receiving oestrogen or testosterone so they can develop the secondary sex characteristics of their identified gender. The court process has been criticised by legal and medical experts, who say the costly process delays essential medical treatment and causes great anxiety for the kids and families involved. Greens senator Janet Rice told BuzzFeed News she feels there is real momentum behind change in this area. I feel very frustrated by most things I am working on in terms of getting action in the parliament, she said. But this one, I think Yes, we might be able to actually achieve something. View this image  Samuel Kubani / AFP / Getty Images Rice and her fellow co-chairs of the LGBTI Parliamentary Friends group, Labor MP Graham Perrett and Liberal MP Warren Entsch, along with independent Cathy McGowan, will hold a meeting of the group to discuss the issue in the first week back. BuzzFeed News understands the most straightforward option would be an amendment to the Family Law Act exempting people suffering from gender dysphoria from having to go to the Family Court. This would mean oestrogen or testosterone could be prescribed by the childs treating doctor, like any other medication. Prior to moving into caretaker mode for the election, attorney-general George Brandiss office was actively considering options for reform. Rice said she was heartened by the cross-party support for the reform among the LGBTI Parliamentary Friends group. Im hopeful this wont become a politicised issue, she said. It should be straightforward, it shouldnt take long, the sooner it happens the better. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"A new regulation to appear in the Federal Register this week will apply to transgender workers and visitors in roughly 9,200 federally operated facilities. View this image  AP / Carolyn Kaster A regulation to be posted in the Federal Register this week will mandate that transgender people in thousands of federally operated facilities whether they are employees or visitors must be granted access to restrooms consistent with their gender identity. BuzzFeed News obtained a draft notice circulated to federal agencies outlining the rule, which will apply to roughly 9,200 properties operated by the General Services Administration.In addition to the estimated 1 million federal civilian workers employed in those spaces, GSA spokesperson Ashley Nash-Hahn told BuzzFeed News, the rule will cover anyone who enters the facilities from people visiting courthouses to those stopping in at Social Security offices. This includes all kinds of Americans, Nash-Hahn said. We wanted to make clear that a person can use facilities that match their gender identity, and we think thats a good thing. A bulletin about the rule, which was circulated to agency heads on Aug. 8 by GSA Administrator Denise Turner Roth, states, Federal agencies occupying space under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of GSA must allow individuals to use restroom facilities and related areas consistent with their gender identity. Chai Feldblum, a member of the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, told BuzzFeed News the rule is of great significance. She added, This type of requirement can change the default for what life is like for those federal employees and people who enter federal buildings.The regulation builds on and reinforces a growing body of interpretations by the Obama administration to protect transgender people under longstanding civil rights laws. Several agencies in recent years have found that bans on sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 ban transgender discrimination as a form of sex discrimination.Among them, the Office of Personnel Management issued guidance on accommodating transgender federal workers in restrooms. Further, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has made clear that transgender employees facing discrimination have a legal cause of action if they are blocked from restrooms that match their gender. The Justice Department announced it was backing the EEOCs view of Title VII. Still, as Feldblum pointed out, the rule being announced this week establishes a proactive requirement this is a rule that federal agencies say, this is how will we will operate. Transgender people do not need to complete any medical procedure to qualify to use the restroom that aligns with their gender, nor can they be required to show proof of surgery, the bulletin states. They also cannot be restricted to single-occupancy restrooms. Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, said that the move is not a big surprise given the trends toward federal protections for transgender people. But, she said, it does provide more evidence that the Obama administration is serious about enforcing the law.But that enforcement is not without resistance. More than 20 states have sued the federal government in recent months for using legal interpretations to clarify protections for transgender people in schools and workplaces. Two lawsuits, one led by Texas and another by Nebraska, challenge guidance documents and argue that bans on sex discrimination do not cover transgender discrimination. Not all federal properties are covered by the GSAs upcoming regulation, Nash-Hahn said. The White House, Capitol building, and national parks are outside the agencys jurisdiction, for example. However, the federal government has made clear that such rules already apply to federal workers and students as a general matter. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The numbers have changed, but the arguments havent. View this image  Torsten Blackwood / AFP / Getty Images View this image  APH View this image  Greg Wood / AFP / Getty Images This bill is necessary because there is significant community concern about the possible erosion of the institution of marriage, said then attorney general Phillip Ruddock as he introduced it on May 27. Shadow attorney general Nicola Roxon said the proposed marriage amendments merely confirm existing law and [Labors] previous commitments to keeping marriage as a heterosexual institution. However, several Labor politicians expressed their dissatisfaction with the bill, despite being bound to vote in favour of it. These MPs included Tanya Plibersek, Anthony Albanese, and Penny Wong.The Australian Democrats and the Greens voted against the bill, saying it was discriminatory and divisive. A 2004 Newspoll commissioned by SBS found 44% of Australians opposed same-sex marriage at the time, 38% were in favour, and 18% were undecided. View this image  David Mcnew / Getty Images Anthony Albanese, Labor: This bill is a result of 30 bigoted backbenchers who want to press buttons out there in the community I have seen a lot of bad parents. I have not seen bad same-sex parents. I do not know very many, but every same-sex couple I know really wants their child and loves their child. That should be respected, not this supposed moral nonsense. Fancy the marriage bill being debated in the House of Representatives of all places! This is a place where divorce is more common than marriages sticking together. Yet we have people here attempting to lecture this nation about the appropriate structure of the family. Patrick Farmer, Liberal: I ask you here today: why should we do things differently just because we can? Why should we drift away from the basics of our human values and traditions? Simply because we live in a society with advanced technology, where anything is possible and different ways of life are available, is not reason enough to change the sanctity of marriage from the way that it was meant to be. Bob Baldwin, Liberal: Bit by bit, the church and its teachings are being whittled away by those who do not attend church or practise religion. The perfect example of this is that more people identify Christmas with a Coca-Cola symbol of Santa Claus than they do with a nativity scene. In much the same way, marriage is becoming a symbol of a union between two peoplenot an institution where lives are built together and children are brought into the world and raised and loved. Paul Neville, National: Let me make myself clear on this matter: I am not homophobic and I am against all forms of discrimination. People should be able to live their lives in Australian society without prejudice, discrimination or bias. I am not judgmental of single-sex relationships, and I recognise that such people should be able to transfer property, superannuation rights and the like. But minorities cannot redefine marriage. Tanya Plibersek, Labor: Some time in the not too distant future, there will be formal recognition of same-sex couples, and the sky will not fall in, and we will not be destroyed like Sodom and Gomorrah, and life will continue. The main difference will be fewer violent or abusive attacks on gay men and lesbians, and fewer teenagers suiciding, because they will not be taught to feel shame about their sexuality as many are now. Michael Organ, Greens: The Marriage Amendment Act 2004 is a disgrace. It is quite clearly discriminatory This is 2004 we are talking about. The government seems to be living in the fifties and seems to deny everything that has happened in regard to so-called gay liberation and rights for people of other sexuality. The government has its head in the sand on this matter. Peter Dutton, Liberal: In this country, according to the 2001 census, 0.5 per cent of marriages were of same-sex couples. In my own electorate, in the 2001 census 53 couples were identified as being in a same-sex relationship. I do not take issue with those people. I do not suggest to them how they should run their lives, and I do not suggest to them that this government should do that. Certainly, that is not what we are doing through this legislation. What we are saying to the Australian people is that we believe the government need to enshrine the definition of marriage in legislation. View this image  Lisa Maree Williams / Getty Images Claire Moore, Labor: The zeal of people and groups in promoting the belief in what they call traditional marriage has in some cases crossed into real vilification and personal attack. I have been deeply sickened by comments and public forums allegedly based on the reasonable effort to raise awareness or promote certain beliefs, often using the word family. Penny Wong, Labor: Many in our community have not witnessed the reality of lesbian and gay parenting and so are closed to the possibility that it might not be as dangerous as they might assume. That hesitation is a typically human one. It is hard to understand something which is not in the realm of your experience and not what youre used to that goes for most of us. In fact, lesbian or gay parents want and have children for many of the same reasons that other parents do. And like all parents they do the best they can for the children they have. Brian Greig, Australian Democrats: I am conscious as I give this speech that I am not talking to those in this chamber or even those who might be listening elsewhere; I am speaking to researchers, students and scholars in the future perhaps 10, 20 or 30 years down the track who will be looking at theHansard debates over this in bewilderment, trying to understand how such an awful law could have happened. Jacinta Collins, Labor: I am trained theoretically as a statistician. To me, deviant means other than the norm. Unfortunately the interpretation I heard last year was that there was this enormous insult to homosexual people because they were being cast as deviants. I do not believe that that was the intent of this statement. I think the statement says that the norm for our society should be marriage as we understand it and that we need to apply care to how we deal with the issues over what is just and unjust discrimination to ensure that it does not undermine how we reinforce our norm for organising our community. That is what I think the meaning of this is. Ron Boswell, Nationals: Children should never be held up as trophies in an attempt to justify or enhance a lifestyle choice. Australian families are not the place for social experiments. Adults who participate in homosexual behaviour make that choice. That is their choice. As I said, I do not condone it; I do not condemn it. They make the choice for themselves but have no right to include children in that choice. Kerry Nettle, Greens: When I hear these issues debated in the Senate chamber, and hear some of the arguments put forward and we have just heard many of them I feel like I have gone through a time warp and am back in the Dark Ages. Brian Harradine, Independent: If we were to start changing the common understanding of marriage, you could expect to have representations made from people supporting the legal recognition of various relationships such as polygamy, polyandry, which is one woman and many men, and polyamory, which is a group marriage of varying numbers. The possibility of group marriages is not so farfetched A quick search of the Internet revealed at least two active polyamory groups in Australia. Michael Forshaw, Labor: To argue that the definition of marriage should be expanded to include other forms of relationships, particularly same-sex relationships, is to destroy the definition of marriage. It does not broaden it; it destroys it. Bob Brown, Greens: That is the next problem when you have a leader who is narrow-minded, who is divisive, who hates people of a certain category, but who says, Most of the rest of the people do, so I can justify that. Brown was then asked to withdraw his assertion that prime minister Howard hates certain people. Acting Deputy President: I would deem that as an unparliamentary expression, Senator Brown, and I ask you to withdraw. Brown: No, I will not, because that is the truth. That is what is being expressed here today. This is hate legislation. Acting Deputy President: Senator Brown, I ask you to comply with the ruling of the chair. Brown: I will not, because I am stating the situation as I see it. I have been cogently developing this argument. This is not a Prime Minister who loves everybody regardless Acting Deputy President: Senator Brown, I have asked you to withdraw. Brown: Yes, you have. Acting Deputy President: Are you going to withdraw? Brown: No, I will not withdraw.

aS"Gov. Phil Bryant had asked the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals to enforce HB 1523, passed earlier this year, while appealing a trial court ruling against the law. View this image  Gov. Phil Bryant Mike Blake / Reuters WASHINGTON A federal appeals court on Friday denied Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryants request that the state be allowed to enforce a recently passed anti-LGBT religious exemption law while the state appeals a trial courts order halting enforcement of that law. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, in denying the request for a stay pending appeal, also denied the governors request to expedite the appeal. Bryant signed the bill, HB 1523, into law on April 5. The bill provided protections for individuals, religious organizations, and certain businesses who take actions due to their sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions regarding same-sex marriage or any sex outside straight marriage. It also provided similar protections for those who object to transgender people. The trial court judge who halted enforcement of the law on the night before it was due to go into effect, U.S. District Court Judge Carlton Reeves, denied the request for a stay pending appeal on Aug. 1. Fridays order came from a three-judge panel of the appeals court: Judges James Dennis, Catharina Haynes, and James Graves. Dennis was nominated to the bench by President Clinton, Hanes by President George W. Bush, and Graves by President Obama. Bryant now could seek a stay from the U.S. Supreme Court or proceed with the states appeal without being able to enforce the law in the meantime.

aS"In Netflixs 80s-throwback sci-fi horror series, Stranger Things, its young hero gets a girly makeover and wins the heart of a boy. For decades, masculine-looking girls in film and television have been a problem to be solved or at worst, queer monsters to be vanquished. WARNING: Spoilers ahead! Eleven (Stranger Things) and Allison (Breakfast Club) after their makeovers. Netflix / Universal Pictures We all know the Classic Makeover Montage well. A beautiful actress were supposed to believe is a homely slob because her hairs a little frizzy is bestowed with a flatiron and some makeup after a parade of product placements, shes the belle of the ball. There is perhaps no feminine transformation as famous as the one in John Hughes The Breakfast Club, that gold standard of high school movies and launcher of a thousand teen cliches. Ally Sheedys Allison goes from Hollywoods idea of a gross, greasy basketcase to pretty in pink under the guidance of a queen bee played by (who else) Molly Ringwald. An unattractive weirdo is effectively cured when she becomes beautiful in the eyes of teenage boys. Netflixs sci-fi horror series Stranger Things, the breakaway hit of the summer, is a hefty homage to 80s genre films and since repackaging tropes was always going to be part of the plan, a Classic Makeover Montage was inevitable. Directed and written by creators Matt and Ross Duffer, Stranger Things follows the aftermath of a boy named Will Byers disappearance in 1980s Indiana. His friends a motley crew of uncool, Dungeons & Dragonsplaying middle school boys attempt to find him with the help of an escapee from a government facility, who has been groomed into a telekinetic weapon. The escapees name and approximate age is Eleven. Played by a very talented Millie Bobby Brown, Eleven is wide-eyed, scrappy, loyal, and brave. Her hair is completely shaved, since the government experimenters who raised her were constantly attaching and reattaching wire-strung nodes to her head. Her imminent makeover, therefore, is different than your basic weird-girl-to-beautiful-girl she was raised in a brutal and presumably genderless way by force. But a makeover is a makeover. Wills friend Mike (Finn Wolfhard), in whose basement Eleven has sought refuge, helps her put on his older sisters makeup and clothes so she can take a trip to their school without rousing suspicion. The end result frilly, feminine, pink has Eleven looking like a miniature version of Ally Sheedy, brand new and beautified, emerging from Saturday detention with the Brat Pack. Eleven touches her new blonde wig in front of a mirror in Mikes house. You look pretty, Mike tells her. Pretty? she asks, not sure whether to believe him. Its a word shell repeat a few times throughout the series gazing at her reflection, seeing the way Mike looks at her. While she struggles to comprehend other words the boys introduce, pretty is one that Eleven understands immediately and intimately. She was robbed of an entire childhood, but having been denied prettiness seems to be one of her short lifes greatest sadnesses. Eleven is at home in a long history of young female characters whose ultimate worth is dictated by her romantic appeal to boys someone who must first become desirably feminine before she can fully claim that worthiness at all. That premise is all the more galling in a show where Eleven is a) the hero, and b) prepubescent. Why on earth does she need to be worrying about attracting boys when shes a literal child one preoccupied with saving people in mortal danger, no less? Even though Eleven didnt make the choice to shave her head, Stranger Things presumes that the ultra-feminine is girlhoods default, a natural and obvious preference. To be masculine-presenting, pop culture tells us, is to be weird, abnormal, ugly, bad (in another word: queer). Prescribed femininity is therefore a cure-all: If a girl can be pretty, she can be available to men. And in 2016, as in the 80s, a girl is still supposed to be both. The tomboys of Motocrossed, Some Kind of Wonderful, and Bend It Like Beckham. Disney-ABC / Paramount Pictures / Redbus Boyish girls remain rather rare in mainstream film and television. When they do show up, their boyishness tends to be a problem to be corrected. Sometimes a tomboys masculinity is merely temporary, a costume to be put on and taken off like with Andrea, played Alana Austin, in the Disney movie Motocrossed: she dresses up like her twin brother to race as him, inspiring the lesbian awakenings of so many 90s kids. As with Amanda Bynes in Shes the Man, Motocrosseds girl ends up safely femme and partnered with a boyfriend by the time the credits roll. In other cases, masculinity in girl characters can be attributed to their sportiness, but the films have to work extra hard to assure that dont worry! even though the girl is tough and strong, shes still pretty and sought after by boys. In 2002s Bend It Like Beckham, Keira Knightleys short-haired and tomboyish Jules, a soccer player, is continually suspected of being a lesbian, particularly by her mom; Jules continually denies the accusations, which becomes one of the films running jokes. Despite an insane amount of chemistry with her best friend and teammate Jess, played by Parminder Nagra, viewers are constantly hit over the head with the apparent fact of Jules heterosexuality, particularly when both Jules and Jess somewhat inconceivably fall for their male coach. Then there are the masculine-leaning girls who are just one of the boys, a bro among bros. In another John Hughespenned 80s film, Some Kind Of Wonderful, Mary Stuart Masterson is Watts, a working class teen tomboy whos BFFs with Eric Stoltz Keith. Watts helps Keith try to land a popular girl, the way a good wingman does, but in the end Keith realizes that hes actually in love with his best friend which he expresses by giving Watts a pair of earrings originally intended for the girl hed been pursuing earlier. Watts is thrilled. What through-and-through tomboy doesnt covet a pair of expensive, girly earrings? If a girls masculinity cant be corrected with compulsory femininity, shes a lost cause: the butt of a joke at best, something monstrous at worst. Queerness which could encompass a characters sexuality, or simply be signified by a deviant gender presentation has been demonized throughout horror film history. The monstrous queer has cropped up in everything from Oscar-winning films like Silence Of The Lambs and Monster to 80s slasher movies, inciting highbrow and lowbrow terror in near equal measure. Just as queerness in any shape or form is a threat to heteronormativity, a figure like Dracula is a threat when seducing the men and women he preys upon, whom he renders through penetration and the exchange of bodily fluids just as villainous as he is. Eleven in Stranger Things isnt a threat the way a lot of classic horror villains are, but what matters is she sees herself that way. When experimenters force her to push the bounds of her telekinesis, she unwittingly creates a tear in space and time, opening a gate to an alternate dimension (the Upside Down) which leads a monster out into the real world. As days pass and Will Byers still hasnt been found, Eleven is wracked with unspeakable guilt. Im the monster, she tells Mike, tears pooling in her eyes. Her monstrosity, she feels, is made visually apparent by her shaved head shes defective, something hideous and unlovable. In one scene, after shes run away from Mike and his friends, worried that she could hurt them or otherwise make matters worse, she leans down over a pond in the woods and screams at her reflection. If only, if only she were normal. If only she were pretty. Stranger Things, which references the work of directors like Steven Spielberg and John Carpenter, borrows 80s film aesthetics to marvelous effect but it also borrows absurdly outdated gender politics, which are a lot less fun to watch. Eleven is defined almost exclusively by her relationships with men and boys: the evil doctor she calls Papa; the group of geeks who go from rejecting her to defending her; and, most significantly, with her friend Mike, who, after seeing her properly girlified, gets a crush on her, kisses her, and asks her to a school dance. Even though Mike still likes Eleven without the wig, which shes thankfully abandoned due to impracticality by the end of the season, her makeover allowed him to see her as someone capable of femininity, rather than just another bro. Regardless, why must any sense of her empowerment or validation come from the way a boy sees her? (And, reminder: These kids are in, like, sixth grade. They are babies.) Elevens heroism and ultimately, her potential martyrdom is overshadowed by her downgrade from stand-alone victor to mourned love interest. On the whole, Stranger Things makes sure to scrub all possible traces of queerness from its characters. Bullies pick on Will, his brother, and his friends by calling them queer freaks, but thats largely an empty insult. Mike is safely paired with Eleven, while Wills brother, Jonathan (Charlie Heaton), after taking enormously creepy photos of Mikes older sister Nancy as shes undressing in a window, becomes her confidante and friend. Lonely hetero geekdom is romanticized in this world stalking is merely a minor offense, something that very well might be less shameful in the shows diegesis than gayness. Stranger Things champions the nerds and the weirdos, as so much of 80s pop culture did, but the writers temporarily put Eleven in a wig and make most characters seemingly straight as if to assure that their weirdness wont become unruly. Queerness, gender-nonconformity (nonwhiteness too, for that matter) in a world with monsters and alternate dimensions, these things are just too alien to make the cut. Eleven and Mad Maxs Furiosa Netflix / Roadshow Films Not every character in the world needs to be LGBT. (Thatd be nice, though.) The issue isnt just that there are no queer characters on so many beloved and critically acclaimed shows the issue is that most characters arent given the opportunity to be anything other than straight or straight-passing. Even female characters on TV who are actually allowed to be full-out, openly queer are overwhelmingly feminine: Emily and her various love interests on Pretty Little Liars; Clarke and her various love interests on The 100; basically everyone on The L Word (Shanes the one sort-of exception, and she wears a ton of makeup). Lea DeLaria as Boo on Orange Is The New Black is one of the only true butches on television today. If a female character is going to be into women, she at least has to look straight so her queerness isnt too much of an aberration. When characters were supposed to root for step outside the bounds of heteronormativity, so often theyre forcefully shoved back into place. But Eleven is a kid. We dont know her sexual orientation and we dont need to. Yet the Duffer brothers felt compelled to give her a makeover and stick her with a boy. (She might have grown up to be with both boys and girls, of course, or no one at all, but in our culture girls are presumed straight unless proven otherwise; even then, theyre belittled and disbelieved.) No matter her orientation, Eleven simply doesnt deserve to be reduced to a romantic plotline with anyone. Even though Winona Ryder made a triumphant comeback as Wills mom, even though Natalia Dyers Nancy can (wow!) shoot a gun pretty well, and even though #WeAreAllBarb, Stranger Things exists squarely in a boys universe. And according to the laws of pop culture, boys still get to complete their heroic quest and win the girl. Another huge hit of the summer, Paul Feigs Ghostbusters, has been widely celebrated precisely because the female characters arent winnable. They exist in their own right, as fucking badasses who save the world, instead of prizes for male protagonists consumption. Its an exciting thing primarily because women deserve to be the heroes of their own stories. But keeping all the female characters unattached also means that Ghostbusters doesnt blanket enforce heteronormativity. Kristen Wiigs Erin gets awkwardly flirty with Chris Hemsworths Kevin, but Melissa McCarthy as Abby is far more concerned about her friendship with Erin (and catching ghosts) than expressing romantic interest in anyone. Meanwhile, Kate McKinnons Holtzmann seduces everything that moves (notably, in a way that doesnt simply perform for the male gaze). Ask any lesbian and shell tell you that McKinnons character is so obviously queer that they left the Ghostbusters theater even gayer than when they walked in. Both Feig and McKinnon wont confirm Holtzmanns sexuality, likely due to studio pressure, which is maddening in its own way. But at the very least, Holtzmann who is far from the most feminine person in the world, in her neckties and whimsical overalls isnt punished for her masculinity, or saddled up with a random dude. Holtzmanns rise comes one year after another female character was afforded similarly refreshing, and rare, freedoms: Charlize Therons Furiosa in Mad Max: Fury Road. After Millie Bobby Brown, the actor who plays Eleven, shaved her head for the role, she was worried shed made a big mistake until the Duffer brothers showed her a picture of Furiosa rocking the same cut. The resemblance was amazing! she told IndieWire. It was the best decision Ive ever, ever made. The more we see women and girls embracing nontraditional gender presentations, the less vilified those presentations will become. Characters like Furiosa and Holtzmann represent the possibility that a woman could be masculine, or queer, or unattached, or some combination of the three without being forcibly feminized, given a boyfriend, or branded a monster. Stranger Things could have easily allowed Eleven to forge meaningful friendships and kick monster ass without preoccupying her with fears about prettiness. Some tropes of the 80 really arent worth reviving the Classic Makeover Montage is one of them. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .

aS"720,601       VIEWS Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, and the filmmaking team behind Sausage Party talk with BuzzFeed News about the 10 years it took to make the first-ever R-rated CG animated movie about a lesbian taco, a Jewish bagel, and an evil literal douche. View this image  Brenda Buns (Kristen Wiig) and Teresa Taco (Salma Hayek) in Sausage Party. Sony Pictures Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg did not know what to expect when they stepped in front of 1,000-plus people at the 2016 SXSW Film Festival in March to introduce their newest movie, Sausage Party. The lifelong friends and creative partners had been working on the R-rated animated feature for 10 years and had stuffed it with more profanity, violence, drug use, sex, and envelope-pushing jokes about race and religion than any major animated film since 1999s South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut or most live-action comedies, for that matter. And on top of that, as Rogen and Goldberg nervously explained to the Austin crowd, some sequences in their anthropomorphized-food movie were still very much incomplete, including a bloody, no-holds-barred battle between the food that resides in a suburban supermarket and their human overlords who shop there and eat them, as well as the massive, graphic, dear-god-what-is-happening-right-now food orgy that serves as the films, er, climax. For anyone concerned, those are not much by way of spoilers Sausage Party is the kind of film that truly needs to be seen to be believed. And that night in Austin, it turned out, the vast majority of the audience were true believers. Did you guys like the movie? Goldberg asked the crowd after the screening; he and Rogen were joined by directors Conrad Vernon and Greg Tiernan and co-writers Kyle Hunter and Ariel Shaffir on stage. As the audience roared in approval, a sense of relief washed over Rogen and Goldberg. During the Q&A that followed, one audience member prefaced his question by boasting, Well, for one, I feel repulsed and blessed at the same time. Another wanted to know if the film had been approved by the MPAA: How are yall getting the big ol fuck scene past them? We did! exclaimed Rogen. You can show food fuuu-uuck! View this image  Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg at the Sausage Party work-in-progress screening during the 2016 SXSW Film Festival on March 14, 2016. Mike Windle Roughly 10 minutes into the Q&A, however, a woman stepped up to the mic. With her voice comparatively muted, she started by praising the work of Salma Hayek, who voices Teresa, a lesbian taco shell. But, she added, who else did you use for your Mexican cultural references? Because I dont think that was represented very well in the film. Oh, the movie very much stereotypes every single cultural group, Rogen said, his trademark jackhammer laugh tightening in his throat. I know, I know, said the woman. But I just want to know who was your reference other than Salma. Rogen nervously talked over her, explaining that Teresas scenes which begin in the Mexican food aisle, reimagined as a dusty desert cantina were meant as references to classic Westerns like The Wild Bunch. Mostly very outdated, he said, laughing anxiously again. Goldberg, a hint of irritation flashing across his face, jumped in. To be very clear, not reality, he said. But the woman persisted, repeating her curiosity about the filmmakers Mexican cultural references, until, as is often the case with awkward moments during film festival Q&As, some in the audience began to jeer her. She sheepishly left the mic, and the moderator shifted to another question. Four months later, sitting in a booth at Canters Deli in Los Angeles, Rogen and Goldberg remembered that tense encounter and the impact it had on their film. When that person said that, I remember being like, Fuck you, what do you fucking know? Goldberg told BuzzFeed News. And then five minutes later, it just sunk in. Like, oh, [shes] got a point. I remember getting quite flustered, because that doesnt happen very often, added Rogen. I hope I treated [her] with respect. Because honestly, it was a valid note, and we listened to it. The movie is a little different because of it. For Rogen and Goldberg, the exchange was emblematic of their decade-long struggle to inject their bawdy, uninhibited sensibility into a Pixar-style animated movie and the complicated creative risks they took in the process. Getting Sausage Party made at all was its own battle, but getting it made the right way involved a near-constant search for balance between wanting to push the boundaries of what an animated feature film can do, and stomping, pissing, and shitting all over those boundaries until audiences run screaming. View this image  Mr. Grits (Craig Robinson), Firewater (Bill Hader), and Twink (Scott Diggs Underwood) in Sausage Party. Sony Pictures Of course, Rogen and Goldberg understand that an adult animated movie about horny, foul-mouthed, ethnically stereotyped food was never going to please everyone. They knew some people would be offended. But what they didnt want Sausage Party to be was hateful. People talk a lot about freedom of speech, and what they forget is, like, yeah, you can make whatever joke you want, said Rogen. And people have the right to be offended by any of those jokes. You can either accept that thats always going to happen, or stop doing it. And if you feel like its happening more than its not, and youre being branded as someone whos mean or reductive to society in some ways, then you should analyze that. And thats exactly what Rogen and Goldberg tried to do in the decade it took to bring Sausage Party to the screen. Teresa Taco, for example, was originally introduced via a villain named El Guaco, a pun-obsessed warlord who ruled over the Mexican food aisle and physically assaulted Teresa and the films main heroine, Brenda Buns (Kristen Wiig); now, El Guaco only appears briefly for a joke about getting hit in his guac and balls. A character voiced by Craig Robinson was initially called Uncle Toms Rice, and his dialogue was written in an unmistakable plantation patois; in the final film, however, his name was changed to Mr. Grits, and his delivery adjusted from the 19th century to the 21st. Rogen and Goldberg were acutely aware that they were wading into tricky waters of representation as straight white men. We know what good Jew jokes there are, and we know good Canadian jokes. And the white person jokes, I suppose, said Goldberg. We know what we arent, and what other people are, and that theyll have a better insight. So when they were facing down a joke that fell outside of their own life experience, theyd ask someone closer to the material. I would call Jerrod Carmichael and be like, So were going with Mr. Grits now. What are your thoughts? said Goldberg. Carmichael, who first heard about Sausage Party while working with Rogen and Goldberg on their 2014 comedy Neighbors, remembered it a bit differently. Evans favorite thing to text me during the making of this [movie] was Is this racist? he said with a chuckle. And my answer was always No. Just go for it. Its not malicious. They are cautious to make sure that they dont just unnecessarily offend anyone. Theyre so aware of it. Its not just empty. Its not just for the sake of saying things. Rogen and Goldberg put just about every joke through that kind of vetting process. If theres anything that people were overwhelmingly just like, This is fucked and hurtful, dont do it! were not the guys who are like, Fuck you! Were doing it anyway! said Rogen. We dont want to hurt peoples feelings. But from my experience, generally, if its funny and its not hurtful, people are happy to be included in the arena rather than upset that theyre included in the arena. Theres some comedy where you feel like, Oh, that persons actually a little racist, maybe. And we do not want to make that comedy. So we very much jump through as many of our own self-imposed hoops as possible in order to really be able to tell ourselves that as far as were pushing it, we come down on what we hope is the right side of this stuff. At least, to us. View this image  Tragedy befalls Peanut Butter and Jelly in Sausage Party. Sony Pictures The self-imposed hoop-jumping began in 2006, when Rogen and Goldberg first had the idea to make an R-rated CG animated movie. We just started getting into how the things we do to food in an everyday way in the context of a Toy Storytype animated movie is actually, like, horrific and quite funny, said Rogen. They also recognized that since food is inherently cultural, making a movie that imbued its edible characters with backstories and identities would necessitate playing to certain stereotypes. There are literally Asian aisles and Jewish aisles and halal aisles, said Goldberg. Its just there. As Rogen explained, in animation, a lot of the jokes come from projecting what you would assume this things personality is based on your use for it, or its appearance. He specifically cited Pixars Cars franchise: The VW bus is the hippie! The Fiats a little Italian guy! The tow truck is a redneck! At the time, Rogens and Goldbergs careers were just starting their upward trajectory, so Sausage Party remained dormant as an eye-catching logline a bunch of hot dogs want to escape their packaging to go fuck buns until Rogen voiced a character in the 2009 DreamWorks Animation film Monsters vs. Aliens and pitched the movie to one of the films directors, Conrad Vernon. As a decades-long devotee of the adult-skewing animated classic Heavy Metal, Vernon was hooked immediately. For DreamWorks, we do our own gags that are very R-rated, he said in a phone interview. We just know theyre never going to make it in the movie. Vernon jumped at the opportunity to, as he put it, cut loose and do some really funny, dirty, R-rated gags and say, This could be in this movie. Soon after, he flew to Vancouver to conscript Greg Tiernan, who runs the independent animation production house Nitrogen Studios Canada with his wife, Nicole Stinn. They were producing the pointedly G-rated childrens program Thomas & Friends, but Conrad knew Sausage Party would be up Tiernans alley. The two met working on 1992s Cool World, which was originally envisioned by iconoclastic animator Ralph Bakshi (Fritz the Cat) as a breakthrough R-rated animated feature, before it was ultimately overhauled by the studio to make it suitable for a PG-13 rating. The industry sees animation as a genre rather than a medium, said Tiernan. It has been pigeonholed into being just for kids entertainment and thats it. Like a cartoon coyote, Rogen and Goldberg hit that brick wall head-on. After they finally hammered out a script for Sausage Party on the set of their 2010 cancer dramedy 50/50, they were rejected by every studio in town. What was so weird to us is that everyone acted like an adult cartoon was fucking a bonkers idea, and we were like, what are the most successful cartoons on television? said Rogen. South Park. The Simpsons. Family Guy. Every cartoon that people watch is an adult cartoon on television. So how come in movies, its such a weird, obscure idea? View this image  Lavash (David Krumholtz) and Sammy Bagel Jr. (Edward Norton) in Sausage Party. Sony Pictures But there was no example of a computer-animated R-rated feature to point to that would indicate how well their film might do at the box office, let alone how they could pull it off. When we were pitching this movie, no one would know what it would look like, said Vernon. I told my friends about this, and even some of them were going, Wait a minute in a theater? Hows that going to work? To gin up industry interest, Rogen and Goldberg hosted a series of script readings. As early as 2010, Goldberg and executive producer Jonah Hill who also voices a hot dog and gets a story by credit began talking about the movie to the press. But it still took until 2013 for Megan Ellisons upstart production company Annapurna Pictures to sign on to co-finance the film, with Sony Pictures distributing, on a mighty lean $19 million budget. The meager resources, however, had a major upside: The filmmakers were left alone to make Sausage Party the way they saw fit. The movie is as uncensored a thing as Ive ever seen, said David Krumholtz, who has known Rogen and Goldberg for years, and who voices Lavash, a Muslim piece of flatbread with a goatee. If they were going to have to water down a movie called Sausage Party, there was no point in doing it. It was going to have to be everything they wanted it to be. That freedom, however, proved to be as precarious as it was promising. View this image  Douche (Nick Kroll) and Popped Cherry Mixer (Maryke Hendrikse) in Sausage Party. Sony Pictures The creative process for the Sausage Party filmmakers necessitated pushing the envelope to its breaking point. As Goldberg put it, You have to go too far, and then pull it back. Any artistic endeavor involves some trial and error, but figuring out how far was too far in the under-explored creative territory of an adult animated feature led the filmmakers down some considerably dark alleys. The movies main villain, Douche, voiced by comedian Nick Kroll, went through a radical change from how he was initially conceived. They had written him originally as more of what would be considered a classic Disney villain, like a Jafar or Ursula, said Kroll. He commanded a horde of rats that wreaked havoc throughout the supermarket and because there was no studio executive telling the filmmakers to limit Douches depravity, they decided to make him disturbingly close with his minions. At one point he was fingering the rats, umwellhe was fingering the rats butthole, said Kroll. Thats the most tactful way I can describe it. Compounding things further, Douche then used his soiled finger to torture Lavash by forcing it in his mouth. I remember at every table read, it would get a collective groan from everyone, said Krumholtz. It was like, My god, how are they going to animate that? What is it going to look like? A few hundred unsuspecting New Yorkers found out the answers to those questions when the filmmakers screened a rough version of Sausage Party in December 2014. At that point, the film was nothing more than a series crudely animated storyboards, but Rogen was convinced it was necessary to screen it for a test audience after an encounter he and his wife had with, of all people, Kanye West. View this image  Brenda (Kristen Wiig) and Tequila (Bill Hader) in Sausage Party. Sony Pictures He basically rapped to us an entire album live that is not The Life of Pablo, said Rogen. I remember coming back from that experience being like, Kanye West is getting way more input than were getting, and hes a lot more talented than we are! Like, we should be really aggressively seeking as much input on [Sausage Party]. So thanks at least in part to Kanye, a small Soho crowd got to watch a storyboard version of the rat scene, and their reaction was so much worse than some groans at a table read. Theres this sound that is the worst you can get in a test review, said Goldberg. When people say, like, My fans and I have a trust its when you horribly betray that trust [that] people make this one godforsaken noise. That is what I think they call an epic fail? It wasnt just that once scene, either. In a focus group afterward, Douche was everyones least favorite character overall the audience found him out of step with the films contemporary, Pixar-ian sensibility. By screening Sausage Party so early, however, the filmmakers were able to course-correct with a top-down rewrite of the character. They lost the rats completely, dialed back the Disney-style theatrics, and made him much more like a classic obnoxious for lack of a better word douche. An early draft of the script obtained by BuzzFeed News makes clear that Douches makeover was hardly the only time the filmmakers dialed back a creative choice they ultimately realized went too far. For example: Lavash was, as he is in the final film, a provincial Muslim caricature who is constantly at odds with the nebbish Sammy Bagel Jr. (voiced by Edward Norton doing an uncanny Woody Allen impression). But Lavash was originally doomed to a premature death due to mold, so during the films climactic battle between food and humans, Lavash sacrificed himself by forcing his body down the throat of a rabbi. Theres also a version where he thinks hes going to die, shoves himself down the throat of the rabbi, and then bursts out of the rabbis stomach, said Krumholtz. Um. That didnt make it in either. Some adjustments came out of early test screenings, but a lot were based on feedback the filmmakers received from their peers. At one point, Rogen and Goldberg invited a small mob of comedy heavyweights like Judd Apatow, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Phil Lord and Chris Miller to screen a rough version of the film at their production company offices on the Sony lot. I remember thinking, My goodness, this room is filled with 30 of the smartest funny people in town! said Lord. Every once in a while, I was like, Oh, thats just crude and not funny, and so I would call that stuff out from a comedy standpoint. If its crude and its insightful, and makes you laugh in spite of yourself, or it makes the audience react in a big way and feel embarrassed and shocked that can be great. According to Tiernan, Baron Cohen thought Lavash killing a human rabbi might be going a bit too far, which delighted Goldberg to no end. We achieved a life goal: We made Sacha Baron Cohen uncomfortable, he said with a giant grin. It was the best. (Baron Cohen was unavailable for an interview for this story.) View this image  Brenda (Kristen Wiig), Frank (Seth Rogen), Sammy (Edward Norton), and Lavash (David Krumholtz) in Sausage Party. Sony Pictures The open-source approach to their creative process also paralleled the evolution of Sausage Partys larger message about faith and belief, as the main hero, Frank (voiced by Rogen), begins to challenge the supermarket creed that they go to an orgiastic heaven when their human gods select them to leave the store as opposed to the reality that theyre horribly mutilated and eaten. [The earlier version] was probably a lot more critical outwardly of faith and belief in general, said Rogen. As we got older throughout the 10 years of making the movie, I think we really became more accepting of a lot of things. My character specifically has to learn the lesson not to just shit all over peoples beliefs. But the process of constant feedback and self-reflection did not make Sausage Party less potentially controversial; actually, quite the opposite. It seemed like every incarnation [of the film] got more offensive, more confrontational in tone and in subject matter, said Krumholtz. While Rogen and Goldberg have spent the better part of a decade diligently trying to keep their film from crossing the line, they still gleefully race as close to the edge of it as they can.

aS'Experts question the gender tests examining genitals, chromosomes, and testosterone levels required of some of the worlds best female athletes. View this image  Dutee Chand (right) Christian Petersen / Getty Images Last summer, 19-year old sprinter Dutee Chands ability to compete in the Rio Olympics was in limbo. Her fate was not tied up in her race time, but rather a controversial rule for Olympians that said female athletes could be disqualified if their natural testosterone levels were too high. Chands were. The rationale behind the rule was that women with high testosterone fall outside the limits of normal female biology, giving them an unfair advantage. If they wanted to compete as women, the rule stated, they would need to take hormones or undergo invasive surgeries. Otherwise, they could compete against the men. Chand decided to fight the rule, which had been adopted by both the governing body of track and field the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) and the International Olympics Committee (IOC). In July of last year, she won: the Court of Arbitration for Sport suspended the so-called T-test. It gave the IAAF two years to come back with scientific evidence that female athletes with naturally high testosterone actually had a significant advantage over their peers. Although athletics events are divided into discrete male and female categories, sex in humans is not simply binary, the Court decided. Nevertheless, it added, it is necessary for the IAAF to formulate a basis for the division of athletes into the male and female categories. In other words, some kind of biological gender test is needed. This week, the IAAF announced that it intended to fight the Courts suspension of the T-test. The IAAF stands by its Regulations and is continuing to collect the evidence, a representative told BuzzFeed News by email. The IOC, meanwhile, said that it would not introduce any new hormone rules until the issues of the case of Dutee Chand are resolved. On Friday, Chand will be competing in the 100-meter dash in Rio, making her the first Indian woman to qualify in the Olympic event in 36 years. As part of the rules temporary suspension, other women with high testosterone will also be allowed to compete. (The rules are different for trans athletes. Although trans men can compete without restriction, trans women will have to demonstrate lowered hormone levels for at least a year before competing.) Historians and bioethicists have argued that Chands victory is only temporary. Even if the T-test is not used next year, the Court is still pushing for a gender test. Critics say these tests try to draw a firm line between the two sexes where none exists in nature at the expense of women athletes deemed too masculine. Over the decades, sports ruling bodies have moved from anatomically inspecting female athletes, to taking cheek swabs for genetic tests, to measuring testosterone levels in blood. At each step, gender has proven to be more complicated than any biological marker we use to try to pinpoint it. Is it genitalia? Is it chromosomes? Is it hormones? Susan Cahn, a history professor at the University at Buffalo and author of Coming on Strong: Gender and Sexuality in 20th Century Womens Sports, told BuzzFeed News. While the IAAF and IOC have continued to search for new ways to neatly sort athletes into female and male categories, their main goal, she said, has stayed the same: excluding athletes who dont fit the mold of true women. Its a complicated debate, and spurs tough conversations about how to create a level playing field in womens sports, at a time when theyve never been more popular or respected. By definition, the worlds best women athletes stand apart for their extraordinary biology. Should some be excluded for the same thing? Here are some of the women who have been questioned, mocked in the media, banned from competing, or had their medals revoked because of their biology. View this image  Stella Walsh (right) and Helen Stephens (left) Fox Photos / Getty Images Stella Walsh (or Stanisawa Walasiewicz, in Polish) immigrated from Poland to Cleveland, Ohio, when she was an infant in the summer of 1911. She quickly demonstrated her running prowess, and by 1930 had set a world record in the 100-meter dash. In the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles, competing on the Polish team, Walsh won the gold medal. But when she competed again in 1936, she was narrowly beaten by an 18-year old sprinter from Missouri, Helen Stephens. Although both women were whispered about because of their athletic builds, after Stephens victory she was publicly accused in the Polish media of being a man competing in the womens category, and the story spread in American papers. youtube.com As a result, Stephens underwent the first genital inspections conducted by the Olympic committee to verify that her anatomy was female, defined as having a vagina, clitoris, and pubic hair, among other measures. The visual test was in many ways induced by the Cold War, Cahn said, as accusations of foul play were rampant, and the body inspections became a mandatory step for women who wanted to compete. Forty years later, after she was unexpectedly shot and killed in an Ohio parking lot, an autopsy of Walsh revealed that she had ambiguous genitalia. Today that would fall under the broad umbrella of intersex conditions or differences of sex development, which affect roughly 1 in 2,000 babies born in the US. In athletes, selected for their extraordinary biology, some of these differences occur even more frequently. View this image  Ewa Klobukowska (right) AP Ewa Klobukowska of Poland competed in the Tokyo Olympics in 1964, at the height of the Cold War. Running in the 100-meter relay, she helped set a new world record and won a gold medal. After the media wrote about her masculine appearance, in 1967 Klobukowska was the first athlete to be tested with the IAAFs new chromosome test, which was viewed as a simpler, objective, and more dignified alternative to the physical examinations. (Although women typically have XX chromosomes and men typically have XY, scientists are finding that many variations exist.) The test results were never made public, but the IAAF ruled that Klobukowska had a chromosomal anomaly that disqualified her from competing in the female category. The organization publicly criticized Klobukowska for being a male imposter, and stripped her of her medals. After being disqualified from competing at the age of 21, she said, Its a dirty and stupid thing to do to me. I know what I am and how I feel. She had a son in 1968. Thirty-one years later, the IOC returned her medals. View this image  Simone Raineri / Via Flickr: simoneraineri Martnez-Patio was a Spanish hurdler who was forced to take the chromosome test in 1986, ahead of a major competition that would have qualified her for the Olympics. The test revealed that, unlike most women, she carried a Y chromosome. One of her team doctors told her to fake an injury so that she could quietly sit out the race, but Martnez-Patio refused. When she won first place, her test results were leaked to the press. Her running times were erased and she was kicked off the Spanish team. I felt ashamed and embarrassed, Martnez-Patio wrote in a 2005 account of her sex testing in the medical journal The Lancet. I lost friends, my fianc, hope, and energy. But I knew that I was a woman, and that my genetic difference gave me no unfair physical advantage. I could hardly pretend to be a man; I have breasts and a vagina. I never cheated. Martnez-Patio has complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, which means that, despite having a Y chromosome and internal testes, her body cannot respond to testosterone. Women with CAIS develop the external sex traits of women, but dont have a uterus and cant conceive children. Martnez-Patio was declared ineligible to compete as a woman for the Olympic games in Seoul in 1988. But, with the support of several prominent geneticists, she fought the chromosome rule and was eventually allowed to compete in the qualifying trials for the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. This time, she missed the mark by ten hundredths of a second, and didnt make it to the Games. Martnez-Patio is now a professor of science education in sport at the University of Vigo in Spain. Surprisingly, in 2015 she testified in favor of the IAAFs T-test. Itd be easy to believe because of the difficulties of that past that I would be opposed to any rules, she told USA Today. Thats not the case. That would not be fair, not be ethical. I understand the positions of other people. I am in favor of rules. View this image  Santhi Soundarajan (right) Karim Jaafar / AFP / Getty Images In 2006, 25-year-old Santhi Soundarajan from India ran in the 800 meter race at the Asian Games in Qatar. Competing against athletes from 45 countries, she won a silver medal. The next day, however, Soundarajan was called in for a blood test and asked her to undress. A few days later, it was announced on Indian national television that Soundarajan had been stripped of her medal because she had failed a sex test. Although born and raised as a girl, Soundarajan carried a Y chromosome. Like Martnez-Patio, she was born with androgen insensitivity syndrome and had female genitalia. Although she had never before doubted being a woman, Soundarajan was suddenly thrust forward publicly as a gender imposter. Struggling with depression, she attempted suicide shortly after returning to India. View this image  Caster Semenya Alexander Hassenstein / Getty Images In 2009 Caster Semenya, a South African track star, broke the 800 meter world record at the African junior championships. Soon after, other athletes publicly questioned the athletes physique. These kind of people should not run with us, Italian runner Elisa Cusma said. For me, she is not a woman. She is a man. IAAF asked that she complete a gender test (which included inspections of her external and internal genitalia), and just hours before she easily won another race in Berlin, her results were leaked to the press: Although she had a vagina, she didnt have ovaries or a uterus, and her body produced three times the testosterone as the average woman. The Time magazine headline read: Could This Womens World Champ Be a Man? The South African government rushed to her defense, filing an official complaint with the UN arguing that disqualifying Semenya was the result of sexism and racism in the sports federations. Many people have made similar criticisms, pointing out that every athlete excluded by routine sex testing has been from a developing country. In July of 2010, the IAAF allowed Semenya to run again. I have been subjected to unwarranted and invasive scrutiny of the most intimate and private details of my being, Semenya wrote in a statement announcing her return to competing in 2010. She said that the sex testing and the accompanying scrutiny infringed on not only my rights as an athlete but also my fundamental and human rights including my rights to dignity and privacy. Semenya will be competing in the 800-meter race in Rio next week. View this image  Dutee Chand Rafiq Maqbool / AP Semenyas case galvanized geneticists and bioethicists to speak out against the IAAF. As a result, in 2011 the IAAF replaced chromosome testing for what it felt was a more secure measure of sex: testosterone. (The organization would only require the blood test if it received a written request about a particular athlete.) In 2014, 18-year old Indian sprinter Dutee Chand became a national champion in the 200-meter race, and was preparing for her first international competition at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. After several athletes complained about her toned physique, doctors from the Athletic Federation of India required her to submit to a blood testosterone test (initially, Chand claims, they told her it was a routine doping test.) According to a complaint later filed by Chand, doctors tested not only her testosterone levels, but made her get an ultrasound, a chromosome analysis, an MRI, and a physical examination that included measuring and palpitating her clitoris, vagina, and labia, as well as inspecting her breast size and pubic hair. A few days later, Chand was told she could not compete because her male hormone levels were too high. Chand decided to fight against the rule, rather than undergo the invasive surgery or hormone therapy needed to lower her testosterone levels. I want to remain who I am and compete again. I have lived my life as a girl, Chand told the Indian Express in 2014. In a landmark victory, Chand won her case last July. She will be competing in Rio in the womens 100-meter race this Friday, August 12. CORRECTION Trans athlete Chris Mosier is on the US mens sprint duathlon team, which does not compete in the Olympics.

aS"There is no room in Indonesia for the proliferation of the LGBT movement, a presidential spokesman reportedly said in response to a new report from Human Rights Watch. View this image  Jewel Samad / AFP / Getty Images [The men] shouted Your pussy has never had a dick so thats why you can be like this, and The Americans are paying you to behave like this to sin against Islam and Indonesia, an activist told Human Rights Watch (HRW). The police officer stood by as the men tried to enter the rented room shared by the two women. Two activists barred their way. If you dont let us in the room, we will force our way in and rape you, one of the men threatened. After more insults and threats, the men eventually left. But, an activist told Human Rights Watch, the couple were advised not to report the incident to police for fear of retaliation. The police were clearly already spying on us if they came with that group to a private room, so there wasnt much we could expect, they said. How can we report the police to the police? View this image  Ulet Ifansasti / Getty Images The report, released on Thursday, slams Indonesian state officials and institutions for their silence over the ongoing campaign of hate. Rights of citizens like going to school and getting an ID card are protected, but there is no room in Indonesia for the proliferation of the LGBT movement, presidential spokesman Johan Budi told AFP in response to the HRW report. Kyle Knight, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, said the past six months had laid bare the extent of the governments prejudices. The anti-LGBT rhetoric also exposed the governments unwillingness to stand between a marginalised minority and its attackers a most basic failure to protect, he said. The rhetorical war was sparked on 24 January, when government minister Mohammad Nasir said he wanted to ban LGBT organisations from universities. It quickly grew out of control. Decrees against gay propaganda were issued and the Indonesian Psychiatric Association claimed being gay was a mental illness. Indonesias largest Muslim organisation, Nahdlatul Ulama, called for the criminalisation of LGBT behaviours and for forced rehabilitation. LGBT activists were startled. The community, which had previously existed amid a quiet combination of tolerance and prejudice, was thrown into unwanted, and dangerous, prominence. View this image  Waria, Indonesian transgender women, at a boarding school. Ulet Ifansasti / Getty Images Rustinawati is the founder and chair of LGBT advocacy group Arus Pelangi. She said the wave of violence has led the group, established in 2006, to withdraw activists from the Aceh region and shift premises for fear of being followed. It is from one thing to another to another. We dont have time to breathe, she said. Arus Pelangi recorded 142 incidents of anti-LGBT violence in the first three months of the year, including hate speech, assaults, arrests, and the prevention of free, public assembly. In South Sulawesi on 15 February, a group of waria (Indonesian transgender women) had stones thrown at them, were hit with batons, and were threatened with swords by a group of men. On 18 February, a boarding school for waria was forced to close after pressure from a fundamentalist group, the Islamic Jihadist Front. Many people reported that the increased anti-LGBT rhetoric led to actual harassment in their everyday lives. Even now when I walk down the street, people yell LGBT, LGBT, a lesbian woman told Human Rights Watch. They dont even know what the acronym means, they just see it in the media and know they should harass people who look different. View this image  Pro-LGBT activists protest on 23 February 2016 in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Ulet Ifansasti / Getty Images Long-term Indonesian LGBT activist Dd Oetomo, of the group Gaya Nusantara, told BuzzFeed News the court should not have the power to make such laws. They will have to say no, [they] are not the parliament, the parliament is the one that actually changes the article, he said. The Constitutional Court can only say it is constitutional or not. Its technically weak, but you never know. Oetomo said the bench was relatively conservative, and he feared a decision against the LGBT community.

aS"We need to do better and we know it, said CBS exec Glenn Geller this week of the predominantly white maleled fall TV lineup. Michael Weatherly on CBS Bull. CBS Kevin James on Kevin Can Wait Via CBS Matt LeBlanc on Man With A Plan Via CBS BEVERLY HILLS, California Three months after his network revealed a fall slate that features six new TV shows with all white male leads, Glenn Geller CBSs executive vice president, current programming addressed that lack of diversity this week. Were very mindful at CBS about the importance of diversity and inclusion. We need to do better and we know it, Geller said at the Television Critics Association summer press tour in Beverly Hills on Wednesday. Thats really it; we need to do better. In terms of leads, we are definitely less diverse this year than last year. And like I said, we need to do better. The new CBS shows premiering this autumn include The Great Indoors starring Joel McHale, Bull starring Michael Weatherly, Man With a Plan starring Matt LeBlanc, Pure Genius starring Dermot Mulroney, Kevin Can Wait starring Kevin James, and MacGyver starring Lucas Till. View this image  Glenn Geller CBS Geller went on to say that CBSs midseason shows feature more diverse leads. Training Day stars Justin Cornwell and Doubt co-stars Laverne Cox, the first transgender person to play a transgender series regular in broadcast history, a fact Geller touted. He also highlighted that nine of the networks current and forthcoming shows added about a dozen new series regulars, many of whom are people of color. I know theyre not leads, but 11 are diverse and that is our commitment to diversity, said Geller. In regard to acting ensembles, he added that CBS is more diverse this year than last. Later, addressing diversity behind the camera,Varietys Maureen Ryan pointed out that a majority of the CBSs new showrunners are also white men. Sometimes our showrunners are diverse, sometimes theyre not diverse, Geller responded. These are the shows we picked up. We pick up the best shows from the pilots we make. We work hard to make sure every facet of our company is as diverse as possible. I hear you. I really do. And I understand we need to do better. Gellers comments had some marked similarities and differences from sentiments he expressed during a CBS press event in May. Were the network that has Madam Secretary, 2 Broke Girls, and Mom. We have lots of female leads. We also have Doubt with Katherine Heigl. I think we have a great balance, he said in the spring. Our new series are more diverse this year than last year. I think were moving in the right direction. In a more concrete effort, CBSs diversity program to seat more women in the directors chair has allowed modest but quantifiable solutions for bringing women into a male-dominated fold.

aS"The country is the first former British colony in the Caribbean to strike down its colonial-era sodomy law, and the move could boost LGBT rights throughout the region. View this image  Jose Cabezas / Reuters The Belize Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that a law punishing homosexuality was unconstitutional. The decision was announced on the LGBT rights group Unibams Twitter account soon after the ruling was made. Unibam first brought the challenge against the law back in 2010. We won on all counts. Speechless. Omg. Speechless Caleb won his challenge to the Belize anti-sodomy law on all counts and was awarded costs! VICTORY for the Caribbean Caleb Orozco, the main plaintiff in the case, told BuzzFeed News in an email that the Supreme Court ruled in his favor on privacy grounds, as well as under protections of dignity, equality, and freedom of expression. He added that the court also decided that protections in the Belizean constitution surrounding sex extend to sexual orientation. Belize, a country of around 350,000 people on the Caribbean coast neighboring Mexico and Guatemala, has had the law in place since its days as a British colony. LGBT advocates are hopeful that the ruling could bolster efforts to eliminate similar laws in 10 other English-speaking countries in the Caribbean that also have roots in their colonial past. Another closely watched challenge in the region is Jamaica, where attorney Maurice Tomlinson brought suit against the countrys law criminalizing homosexuality in December. Tomlinson has accused the countrys Supreme Court of stack[ing] the deck against his litigation by granting standing to conservative groups supporting the provision. Tomlinson recently won a partial victory in a separate suit challenging laws in Belize and the country of Trinidad and Tobago that barred gay people from entering the country. The Caribbean Court of Justice, which has jurisdiction over the countries in the Caribbean Community, held that the laws were discriminatory and therefore unenforceable. But the court dismissed the suit as unnecessary because the countries werent actually blocking anyone from entry under the provision. Speaking before the ruling on Belizes homosexuality law was issued, Tomlinson told BuzzFeed News that a decision to strike down the provision could be highly persuasive to courts in other Caribbean nations where similar suits could be filed, and the reasoning would be very important for my ongoing challenge to the Jamaican anti-sodomy law.

aS"They say Sainsburys has offered them a 10 gift card for the inconvenience. Sainsbury's Thomas Rees / Via Supplied Thomas Rees was shopping in Sainsburys in Hackney, London, on Monday when a security guard approached him and his boyfriend to say someone had complained about them holding hands, he told BuzzFeed News. The 32-year-old said he had just finished paying for his shopping at the Hackney Road store when he and his boyfriend Josh were beckoned over by the guard. At first he thought they had accidentally stolen something, because we were made to feel like criminals. My boyfriend and I became aware we were being watched, Rees said. We were holding hands, arms around each others waists, basically showing public displays of affection. As we came to pay for our shopping I noticed a security guard watching us. Once we had paid, he then approached us and asked us to follow him outside. Rees said the security guard told them a customer had complained about the couple. The guard said that while he was brought up to believe in live and let live, he had to tell them the customer had said they were touching and behaving inappropriately. Rees said he did not witness the complaint being made and was stunned and shaking. I just dont understand why he needed to take us outside and why he needed to tell us, he said. There was no sense of humility. I refuse to believe this would have happened to a heterosexual couple we just stared in disbelief. The issue here is it felt like like 1960s Britain. To the bigot who complained about my bf & I holdin hands & the security guard at @sainsburys who felt the need to 'talk' to us outside @sainsburys @doganddinosaur homophobia is still around its 2016 some people really do make me laugh! Imagine complaining about people HOLDING HANDS. Just imagine. https://t.co/2bXzcv4Zit .@sophiechristoph @doganddinosaur What SHOULD'VE happened here is yr security guard having a talk outside with the bigot, right @sainsburys? Rees said the guard acted inappropriately in deciding to pull them aside and that Sainsburys should ensure staff are fully trained to deal with diversity. He now feels uncomfortable shopping in the local store for fear of seeing the guard or discovering other customers in the store who share the same views as the complainant. The sad thing is there are multiple situations when Josh and I are holding hands and Im the first to push him away, he said, but I felt safe surrounded by my community and I was oblivious and unguarded. He was torn over whether to complain, he said, but part of me thought I should raise my voice. A customer service representative had since offered Rees a 10 gift card to apologise, he said, but he felt the gesture was not enough and Sainsburys should instead ensure all staff are properly trained. This is not the first time the supermarket has found itself embroiled in controversy over its treatment of same-sex couples. In 2014, campaigners staged a kiss-in at a Sainsburys store in Brighton in support of LGBTQ rights after a security guard allegedly asked a lesbian couple to leave a store for kissing. At the time the retailer apologised and said: This should never have happened. A spokesperson told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday: We do not tolerate discrimination in any form. We are investigating this urgently with our security contractor. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"A new transgender toolkit will help families struggling with the legal process. View this image  Via latrobe.edu.au  Australia is the only nation in the world that requires transgender teenagers to go through the court system before they can access cross-sex hormone treatment. This treatment, which usually begins around age 15 or 16, entails transgender children receiving oestrogen or testosterone so they can develop the secondary sex characteristics of their identified gender. There was a clear need, there was a lot of fear around the process, she said. The guide, available online, explains the stages of the court process from pre-trial preparation through to the hearing and decision and addresses questions, for instance, what happens if parents are separated or divorced. Every Stage 2 case that has been heard by the Family Court has resultedin the Court approving treatment. It would be a very rare situation wherethe medical experts and parents supported treatment and the Courtdid not, the guide reads. View this image  Sean Davey for BuzzFeed Kelly said there is a real misunderstanding of the rigorous diagnostic process transgender children undergo before they approach the court for treatment. Most of these kids are expressing some kind of gender dysphoria by the age of two or three. Its persistent, it becomes really distressing for them by the time they are close to puberty. Their mental health is rapidly deteriorating, said Kelly. The argument is Lets let them wait, as though that doesnt have repercussions. A child left untreated has much higher rates of self harm and suicide. A lot of parents have said that to me the risk of not treating is a dead child.

aS"Tickets top out a $250,000. View this image  AP / Invision/ Evan Agostini The LGBT donor class has coalesced around Hillary Clinton for years, first in her run for senate and now her bid for president. Another fact: Barbra Streisand is a gay icon. So, give the people what they want. According to an invitation obtained by BuzzFeed News, Streisand will serenade a LGBT-targeted fundraiser for Clinton on Sept. 9 at Cipriani Wall Street in New York City. Featuring a rainbow H logo, the invite from LGBT for Hillary says dinner tickets start at $1,200, with limited availability, and top out at $250,000 per ducat. Donors who break six figures get a meet-and-greet reception with Clinton. Though she didnt endorse same-sex marriage until 2012, Clinton has espoused an LGBT platform and released a plank that pledges to use existing civil rights laws to expand LGBT protections. She has pursued a symbiosis with LGBT organizations and causes, earning the early endorsement of the LGBT group Human Rights Campaign. The Democratic nominee also targeted LGBT voters this year in New York City to cinch a primary victory in the state. Streisand who Out declared one of the 12 greatest female gay icons of all time has been a Clinton stalwart this year. She wrote an essay criticizing sexism directed at Clinton and tweeted her defense of the nominee collecting money for speeches to Wall Street bankers. What's the issue about Secretary @HillaryClinton getting $225k a speech when Pres Bush 41/43 got $1m/Trump $1.25m. OK for men but not women? The event next month benefits the Hillary Victory Fund a committee authorized by Hillary for America, the Democratic National Committee, and state parties.

aS"Its the literal last supper. View this image  Mick Tsikas / AAP Image Peter Stokes, president of Salt Shakers, emailed supporters on July 29 to say the group would be closing its doors on the last day of 2016. Salt Shakers was founded in 1994 by Stokes and his wife Jenny. He cited their age and the difficulty of finding a replacement leader as the reasons for the group closing down. View this image  Supplied I can categorically say that had it not been for Senator Abetz and his consistent stand for Christian values in the Parliament, the tide of evil would have moved much, much faster in Canberra, Stokes writes. One day we may be able to tell the whole story, but now is not the time. Stokes noted pushes for federal anti-discrimination protections and same-sex pseudo marriage as examples of the progress of evil. We are thankful that, over 20 years later those goals have still not been achieved, he wrote. Abetz addressed the Salt Shakers annual dinner in 2005, and was criticised by activists at the time, including prominent LGBTI equality campaigner Rodney Croome. In his 2005 speech, Abetz hit out at church leaders for becoming involved in political issues such as the privatisation of Telstra and the Native Title debate. View this image  Salt Shakers Yes, change is possible. It is possible to leave the homosexual lifestyle, the website reads. Of course, some people dont want to change no-one can force someone to do so. However, for those who want to change there is help available and many people who have made the change. The website goes on to say that Jesus Christ can help gay people in their transformation to wholeness. Gay conversion therapy has been condemned by the Royal Australia and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists and the Australian Psychological Society. In 2015, a report from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called for nations to ban the practice and described it as unethical, unscientific and ineffective and, and may be tantamount to torture. View this image  Chung Sung-jun / Getty Images Alan Chambers has said I have tried this and failed, therefore its not possible for anybody else to come out of homosexuality, he said. Its a bit like a drug addict saying I tried to stop and I couldnt do it so nobody else can do it. The closure of Salt Shakers was welcomed by Anthony Venn-Brown, a prominent opponent of gay conversion therapy and the founder of Ambassadors and Bridge Builders International. They are one of the few conservative Christian organisations left who have not swayed in their promotion of gay conversion therapy, Venn-Brown said. Croome told BuzzFeed News that if Salt Shakers had made similar comments about racial minorities as they had about LGBTI people, Abetz would be censured for speaking to them. The fact he has not been censured is a worrying sign about the extent to which gay hate speech will be tolerated during a plebiscite, he said. Eric Abetzs office was contacted for comment and did not respond to BuzzFeed News by time of publication. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Singling out gay men who do not use condoms is intentionally provocative, homophobic, offensive, and inaccurate, the CEO of Britains largest HIV charity said. YouTube Getty NHS England has said it strongly denies the accusations of homophobia levelled at it last week following its statement regarding the drug that prevents HIV but refused to comment further. After the high court ruled on Tuesday that NHS England can provide Truvada, the medication that blocks HIV, the organisation published a response that described the drug protocol (called PrEP pre-exposure prophylaxis) as a measure to prevent HIV transmission, particularly for men who have high-risk condomless sex with multiple male partners. The statement also said that given the ruling, NHS England cannot now confirm funding for other treatments and services, which it did not name, but it did refer to the category under which they fall, allowing media organisations to report that treatments such as those for children with cystic fibrosis could be affected by the courts decision. In response, Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust Britains largest HIV charity wrote to Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, condemning the tone and content of its statement. Green wrote: Singling out gay men who do not use condoms is intentionally provocative, homophobic, offensive and inaccurate. View this image  Terence Higgins Trust / Facebook He also condemned NHS England for suggesting other treatments would be affected by the ruling, explaining that any delays in those services came as a result of NHS England stopping the pre-commissioning process for PrEP, which both stalled other commissioning decisions and triggered the court case brought by the National Aids Trust. The only purpose of the above statement is to pit one patient group against another, wrote Green. The results can be seen in the sensationalist, moralistic headlines and homophobic statements being made in the UK press today. The Daily Mails front page blared What A Skewed Sense of Values and referred to the pill as a lifestyle drug, while a headline from The Times said: HIV drug puts other care at risk, warns NHS. Daily Mail The Times Green asked Stevens to apologise and withdraw the statement, arguing: It is unacceptable for the National Health Service to misrepresent the facts and to portray gay men in this judgemental way. But in response to an email from BuzzFeed News asking whether NHS England would be retracting or apologising for its statement, a spokesperson said it strongly denies the claims [of homophobia and inaccuracy] and will be responding to the letter as soon as possible. The spokesperson added that there would be no further comment at this stage. Dismayed at NHS Englands handling of the outcome of case, several other HIV organisations and campaigners echoed the comments made by the Terrence Higgins Trust. Gus Cairns from NAM (the National Aids Manual) accused NHS England of using this innovation in HIV prevention as an opportunity to turn different patient groups against each other and promote homophobia HIV hatred on a level we havent seen since the 1980s. Those responsible, said Cairns, should hang your heads in shame. Lisa Power, co-founder of the LGBT rights charity Stonewall, and a former director of policy at the Terrence Higgins Trust, added: The opening line of this release has led directly to grossly homophobic and discriminatory front-page coverageit is years since we had to deal with stuff like this, so openly judgmental from health services. Wpa Pool / Getty Images Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England (left) and Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust Monty Moncrieff, CEO of London Friend, an LGBT health charity, agreed: The tone of this statement has contributed to skewed and homophobic press coverage. NHS England should consider how their wording frames the (legitimate) debate on clinical prioritisation unfairly. It is disingenuous to suggest that it is the outcome of the legal action that has delayed other commissioning decisions. Clinicians also objected in the strongest possible terms. Tristan Barber, one of Britains most prominent HIV consultants, wrote: Government sleight of hand to encourage division is grim indeed adding that PrEP has been shown to be cost saving, even if we reduce the argument to the economic. He said NHS Englands rhetoric following the high court ruling was a political tactic tantamount to inciting hatred. NHS England plans to appeal against the high court ruling.

aS"At a time when homophobia and hypermasculinity still pervades mens sports, the 2016 Bingham Cup brought hundreds of gay athletes to Nashville. Inclusive rugby is working to dispel anti-LGBT sentiment in international athletics could it do the same in the American South? View this image  The Melbourne Chargers battle the Sydney Convicts in the final match of the Bingham Cup. The Chargers defeated the Convicts 207. Joe Buglewicz for BuzzFeed News Early on a Friday morning in May, in the middle of a rugby match in Nashville, Tennessee, something strange was happening: stillness. You dont expect much stillness from rugby, a game thats easiest to explain to non-ruggers as a sort of cross between soccer and American football with nonstop play (and no pads). Things like scoring and rule-breaking will bring a game to a quick halt, but otherwise play surges on fiercely, unforgivingly unless somebodys bleeding. And right now, Kazu Hishida was bleeding. The Nashville Grizzlies and the Montreal Armada were bunched on a makeshift pitch at Ted Rhodes Park, standing together in small groups or taking a knee, calmly and quietly waiting while 41-year-old Kazu Kaz, for short was escorted to the sidelines, blood streaming freely from his eye socket. His coach, 47-year-old John Purdom, tended to him. Kaz looked annoyed at having been pulled from the game. Dark-haired and handsome, he stood a little taller than Purdom, who wore a Grizzlies jersey over a kilt and scratched his white beard with concern. Are you ready? John asked him, after the worst of the bleeding had stopped. Fuck it, Kaz said, flecks of red mixed with dried mud still staining his cheek. He ran back in. This is rugby, a sport that is now played in more places around the world than ever before: According to World Rugbys 2015 report, there are 7.73 million players in 120 countries. Mens and womens seven-player rugby are debuting at the Rio Olympics this summer, in a testament to the sports booming international popularity. But something was different today than what the world will soon see in Rio. In the bleachers at Ted Rhodes, a guy in his twenties wore a pink crop top jersey with his boyfriends name and number on the back amid a backdrop of rainbow umbrellas, tutus, and tank tops. Among the standard screams of Hit him! Hit him! and Look where we are, boys! were the additional cheers of Move those cha cha heels! and Yaaass, honey! The Nashville Grizzlies celebrated their clubs 10-year anniversary this year by hosting the Bingham Cup, the world championship for international gay rugby, and the second largest rugby tournament for 15-player teams in the world. The Cup brings together amateur teams whose players rely on flexible work schedules, forgiving bosses, supportive partners, and high pain tolerances to make rugby a large part of their lives. For Bingham 2016, players on 42 teams from 21 countries poured into Nashville to duke it out for the championship as well as to reconnect with old friends, get to know a new city, and pound the requisite gallons of beer. Since 2002, gay-inclusive teams have gathered every other year at a different spot on the globe to compete, celebrate gay inclusion in sports, and honor the memory of Mark Bingham, for whom the Cup is named; he was a founding member of two of the first gay rugby clubs in the United States before he died on United Airlines Flight 93 during the attacks on September 11. When, in 2015, Grizzlies veteran Jon Glassmeyer spearheaded the proposal to bring Bingham to the American South for the first time, he wasnt expecting that a rash of anti-LGBT bills were poised to spread across the country, particularly below the Mason-Dixon line. In April, the month before Bingham was held, Tennessees governor signed a bill allowing counselors to refuse service based on their beliefs; critics believe the measure targets LGBT therapy-seekers. And in the neighboring state of North Carolina, House Bill 2, signed in March, has inspired widespread ire, celebrity condemnations, and mass boycotts most recently, the NBA announced it would no longer host its 2017 All-Star game in Charlotte in protest of the law. Amid a tangible swell of anti-LGBT sentiment, hundreds of unapologetically gay ruggers, along with their friends and families, poured into Nashville to play in an unapologetically gay rugby tournament regardless of the political turmoil unfurling around them. Jeff Wilson, the 20122016 chairman of International Gay Rugby, told me over the phone that when he spoke to the European Parliament about bringing Bingham to Nashville, the biggest thing its members were concerned about was social impact, and the protection of the players in the American South. It was the kind of concern that carried all the more weight after the tournament had ended just two weeks later, a shooter opened fire at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, killing 49 people and injuring dozens of others. Someone could have shot up our opening ceremony, Wilson reflected. Pulse reminded a country of LGBT people especially those of relative privilege who have fallen into a kind of complacency around queer struggle that the war has not yet been won. Having events in places that arent traditionally accepting and safe is still important, said Wilson. You cant look away from the social justice piece of gay-inclusive sports from Nashville to Columbus, Ohio, to Nairobi, Kenya. Were still fighting for rights, he added. Sometimes the best way to do it is to invite people to play a rugby game. View this image  The Charlotte Royals at the Bingham Cup opening ceremony. Joe Buglewicz for BuzzFeed News An old saying goes that rugby is a hooligans game played by gentlemen. After tearing each other apart on the field, ruggers tend to their wounds and transition almost seemingly into their third half drinking and singing and shooting the shit together, as brothers. I joined womens rugby my sophomore year of college partly to get exercise, but mostly to meet girls. I didnt do this consciously I was still half-closeted at the time but womens rugby is stereotypically packed with lesbians. Maybe its because the power and strength rugby demands of its players connotes butchness. Maybe its because all the touching and hitting and lifting can look gay to spectators who dont know any better. Maybe its because (in the US, at least) rugby isnt widely played, understood, or appreciated its an underdog sport that attracts people who are used to living outside of the norm. Most of the men I spoke with at Bingham had found rugby the same way I did: They were looking for community, for connection, and maybe theyd find it in a sport where you knock the shit out of other people without wearing so much as some light protective padding. Many of the 62 Grizzlies players have only started playing within the last year or two. Its a complicated and barbarous sport to leap headfirst into for men who, in some cases, havent played contact sports before or any sports at all. When I asked one Grizzly if hed ever participated in organized sports, he asked me if marching band counted. Stan Schklar, a fit, stocky 55-year-old with a short white beard, clear blue eyes, and a soft Southern accent, was a founding member of the Grizzlies 10 years ago and now is the teams oldest player. Its like a family reunion, he told me on the sidelines of a pre-tournament Grizzlies practice, after the fifth time this had happened. All my rugby friends I dont get to see, and theyre all here in my hometown! Unbelievable, unbelievable. He laughed and waved at another friend. Good to see you too, sweetie! Stan didnt play sports growing up, but when a friend asked him to help start up a rugby team, he knew nothing about it I didnt know what a rugby ball looked like, for that matter, he said. It was a way to get up and moving, for a small group of gay friends to do something new, something different. At first, Stan thought it would just be a casual hangout sort of thing. A lot of other guys, later on, would join for similar reasons: to meet new people and to get to know the gay community of Nashville. Many had no idea it would eventually become something that felt essential to their sense of self. At first, I dont think we realized how profound it would be, Stan said. A lot of people, a lot of the guys here, grew up thinking they couldnt play sports, that they wouldnt be good enough, he added. Now Ive seen so many guys excel at this. Mark Pilkington, a 27-year-old blonde, bearded scrum half and soon-to-be-elected Grizzlies president, joined the team nearly five years ago. He had friends on the Royals (based in Charlotte, North Carolina), who were playing a game against the Grizzlies soon after Mark moved to Nashville. He came to a practice, just to check it out, and got hooked. He had previously been a college cheerleader for four years at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He told me that in terms of athleticism and stamina-building, he was well-prepared for the transition to rugby. Cheering for a four-hour football game and hoisting young ladies above your head in the heat is a real thing out here, he said. But I dont know how you can prepare yourself for getting run over by men twice your size. Both of the Grizzlies captains, however, are rugby veterans. Co-captain Michael Scurvy McKervey, a 33-year-old ball of spritely energy with wispy light brown hair and the features of a particularly fit elf, leads the forwards: the guys responsible for tackling, scrum downs (where eight guys from each team bind together and push the opposite teams scrum over the ball, which kinda looks like a giant group hug but with a lot of grunting), and rucking (a bit like mini-scrums, a few guys pushing over the ball to clear it for play). Hes been playing rugby since he went to college in Michigan. As a straight guy, he hadnt been actively seeking out a gay-friendly team but liked that the Grizzlies had this great family feel, he told me. Though LGBT people are very visible in gay rugby leadership roles, many of the team captains at Bingham were straight oftentimes since theyd been encouraged in sports their whole lives. According to Out on the Fields, an international study on homophobia in sports commissioned in part by the Bingham committee, a majority of lesbian and gay youths participate in organized sports, but 7 out of 10 of them believe sports dont offer them a safe environment. An equal percentage are closeted while playing youth sports, fearing discrimination from other players and officials. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths are also more likely than their straight peers to quit at earlier ages and move into more singular activities. Leaders on gay-inclusive teams may include more straight people than one may expect simply because straight players tend to have been playing team sports longer. View this image  Nashville Grizzlies captains Josh Buchanan and Mike McKervey. Joe Buglewicz for BuzzFeed News Scurvys 35-year-old co-captain, Josh Buchanan, is also straight. Tall and reddish-brown-bearded, Josh wrangles the backs: These are the players responsible for running the ball, or, as Scurvy calls them, the fast guys with good hair. Josh and Scurvy complement each other well in terms of leadership styles. Scurvy is a self-described naturally very loud person, whereas Josh has a deep, soothing voice and and a slow, easy-does-it smile. In rugby, sometimes you need someone to scream bloody hell at you because youve gotta get in that ruck, goddamnit, and sometimes, when the ref fails to call an obscenely high tackle and your endorphins are encouraging you to retaliate, you need someone to calmly talk you off the ledge. On Thursday evening, in front of the Parthenon Nashvilles somewhat garish full-scale replica of the original, built in the late 19th century inside Centennial Park the Grizzlies warmed up with a few basic passing drills under some ominous-looking clouds. One of the things rugby newcomers tend to struggle with is that you can only pass the ball backward, not forward. Scurvy is unfazed at the prospect of teaching newbies. Its a challenge in every rugby team, he told me from the sidelines at practice. Everyones accepted, regardless of athletic ability, Josh added. All weekend, players kept telling me how accepting rugby is, even though it might look brutally unapproachable from the outside. Perhaps, at this point, its a self-fulfilling prophecy. According to the Out on the Fields study, gay men are more likely to play rugby in either amateur or professional leagues than any other sport. Last year, International Gay Rugby coordinated the signing of agreements with both World Rugby and USA Rugby with the aims of promoting inclusion and eliminating homophobia from the game across all levels and teams, setting an international standard for what gay-inclusive sports can look like. View this image  Nashville Grizzlies captain Mike McKervey talks to his team during a Bingham Cup tournament match. Joe Buglewicz for BuzzFeed News The opening ceremonies were supposed to be held on Thursday evening outside on one of Vanderbilts beautiful lawns, but as the first cracks of thunder boomed out over Nashville, dozens of teams in carefully coordinated outfits (Make America Gay Again hats; lots of rainbow ties, kilts, and booty jorts) trooped inside a Vanderbilt auditorium. The nights host, scrum half and ex-cheerleader Mark Pilkington, took the stage in a glittery gold blazer to introduce the nights speakers. One of them was Mayor Megan Barry, who wore an honorary Grizzlies jersey and spoke to a cheering crowd during the opening ceremonies about state pride and sometimes, lack thereof. When we say were from Nashville, we dont always add Tennessee, she said. Nashville is, much like Austin, Texas, a dot of blue in an ocean of red Nashville, Knoxville, and Memphis are the only cities in the state to offer ordinances prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Scott Ridgway, the executive director of the Tennessee Suicide Prevention Network, thought hosting Bingham here was sending a clear message that there are members of the Nashville community committed to breaking down barriers. We are in the Bible Belt its much more difficult for some folks to have acceptance for sexuality than in other areas, he said via phone. Hed been involved with the Grizzlies since his partner, Jon Glassmeyer, joined about eight years ago. (The pair were integral to making Bingham happen in Nashville Scott had chaired a host committee, raising tens of thousands of dollars through small individual donations alone.) Other speakers that night included Tennessee Rep. John Ray Clemmons, IGR Chairman Jeff Wilson, and a video call from country stars Garth Brooks, Trisha Yearwood, and Ty Herndon. While Mayor Barry was especially cheered for her warm Southern welcome, there was perhaps no one more eagerly anticipated by the growing-antsy crowd than Alice Hoagland. Alice is the mother of Mark Bingham, whom the tournament honors, and is nothing short of beloved in the Bingham community. Shes got shoulder-length white hair and one of the biggest smiles youve ever seen, enclosed with a few parentheses of laugh lines. Players shake her hand, hug her, take pictures with her, tell her how Mark inspired them to play rugby after years of thinking there was no place in sports for them, and chant AL-ICE! AL-ICE! whenever she takes a podium. She has seen the tournament grow from its humble beginnings 14 years ago to one of the largest rugby tournaments in the world. She looked absolutely delighted to be up at the podium tonight. She thanked Nashville for being so welcoming, and she spoke about courage. Being gay, she said, doesnt mean you cant be tough and strong. Mark taught her that. This is the culmination of a magnificent life of rugby, and I just wish Mark were here to see it in person, she said. I look out here and see these faces, and I see my sons face looking back at me.

Joe Buglewicz for BuzzFeed News For so long, planning Bingham had been about the logistics raising money, prepping the fields, working with vendors but now it was really dawning on the Grizzlies that three days of fierce competition lay ahead of them. And they wanted to win. Bright and early on Friday morning, the Grizzlies arrived at Ted Rhodes Park. The Grizzlies have two different sides: The B team would play in Division 3, while the As simultaneously competed in Division 2. Games would be played across seven different fields from early in the morning til late in the afternoon for three straight days it was rugby everywhere you looked, teams doing dynamic stretches and passing drills to prep for impending kickoffs. The teams were competing across three different divisions for a host of different awards, the most coveted being, of course, the top prize: the Bingham Cup. Tucked in the middle of the fields was the players village, featuring a canopy tent for each team, in which players would seek respite from the sun between games. The Grizzlies B team was about to face off against the Montreal Armada. I sat on drooping bleachers next to an older woman with short white hair and a rainbow visor, who, after kickoff, asked me if I knew what was happening. Have you seen a rugby game before? I asked her. Ive watched Invictus, she answered. View this image  Onlookers cheer during the Bingham Cup final game. The Melbourne Chargers defeated the Sydney Convicts to take the cup. Joe Buglewicz for BuzzFeed News Many of the spectators I chatted with over the weekend shared similar sentiments. Unless youve played it, watched Matt Damon do it, or found clips on YouTube, you may well never have seen rugby played before. Even I struggle to figure out what the hell is going on sometimes, when all you can see is a pileup of players 50 yards away, their limbs flying in a violent blur. But this is also one of the beautiful things about US rugby: It tends to foster a culture of openness in which learning is encouraged and celebrated. A die-hard football fan might sneer at you for not knowing whats going on in a game, but an American rugger would usually delight in being able to share with you this crazy, imported sport they love so dearly. At practice the day before, I chatted with Nathan Jones, the warm, buoyant partner of Grizzlies player Jamie Roberts, who told me that this community is just as strong for players significant others. There are certain universal truths understood by everyone who shares a life with a rugby player: Saturday is a total waste, because Saturday is rugby day. And you have to be immune to mud, he added. From traveling with Jamie to away games, Nathan has gotten to know the partners of rugby players all over the country. In terms of the gay rugby wives, brunch is legendary, he said. In any city, we know where the bottomless mimosas are. Its such a close-knit family. Any city we show up in, its ready-made community the minute youre there. He added that the Grizzlies, in their regular season, faced all straight teams this year. Down in Chattanooga, one of the players wives walked up to me like, Is it okay if I sit with you, honey? And I said, Of course! And an hour later I had no idea people were tagging me in a photo its me and 11 other women. Its like your best girlfriends ever wherever you go. When Nathan and Jamie moved to Nashville a couple years ago, rugby helped them find their people. With Bingham you see how that extends internationally, no matter where you are, he said. Now, I walked the lady in the rainbow visor through a few of the plays: During scrum down, after the ref yells out CROUCH, BIND, SET, the teams hookers are battling for the ball, kicking it back through their second line, past the eight man, so the scrum half can pluck it up and toss it to the backline. After a few strong runs in a solid but relatively uneventful game (discounting Kaz bleeding from the eye for a hot second), the Grizzlies B team beat Montreal 155 for their its game of the tournament. Whooping and grinning, they ran through a tunnel the Grizzlies A team made by standing in two lines and extending hands for slapping, to congratulate their fellow brothers. View this image  The Nashville Grizzlies leave the field after a Bingham Cup match. Joe Buglewicz for BuzzFeed News Hey, girl! Off the pitch, this was the casual greeting of choice. It was refreshing to hear male athletes call each other girl as a means of insider welcome, rather than a means of debasement and belittlement. When my womens rugby team in college would practice across the field from our mens team, their coach and captains would often scream at the guys to pick it up, girls pussies, sissies, wimps, weaklings as if we werent putting in the same amount of backbreaking work 10 meters away from them. In mens rugby particularly in the US, where people arent as familiar with the sport some straight players feel the need to over-emphasize their straightness and masculinity because theyre playing something that allegedly looks gay. The activities you do in rugby, taken outside of the context of rugby, would seemvery homoerotic, Scurvy told me. Youre gonna grab a dick once in a while. Tackling, locking, just accidentally. It happens! One of the ways casual misogyny has infected rugby culture is in the dissemination of rugby songs from generation to generation, rugger to rugger. Theyre an enormous part of rugby culture for university-level ruggers a kind of shared language between teams, raunchy nonsense to sing over beers and shooting the boot, a cringeworthy event in which a rugger whos just scored their first try gets to drink beer out of their cleat from the days game. The mens team at my school would gather on the central green at night and scream songs between chugs of Natty Light, including one that included a lyric about burying a woman alive and digging her back up to have sex with her. Alistair Kitchen, the 24-year-old coclub captain for the Sydney Convicts reigning Bingham champs and, according to some of the American players I spoke with, the It girls of the tournament joined Australias first gay-inclusive team, even though he was straight. He told me he was looking for a group without the macho, over-masculine environment that has poisoned a lot of sports. At his residential college in Australia, the rugby songs were a big turnoff for him. Its like they didnt even think they can be funny in a song without being misogynistic. My college team skipped songs about violence against women, but we did sing a hell of a lot of traditional rugby songs with explicit sexual references wed often just swap genders or change pronouns to make them gayer, or wed add in new gay verses. The Grizzlies make similar edits, in the spirit of inclusivity. Josh McCluey, a 29-year-old wing, said that they tend to stick to the typical scripts, but maybe with a gay flair to them. Well make a lot of them gayer, Thomas Hormby, the Grizzlies secretary, told me. Unfortunately, theyre still often just as explicit, but not misogynistic, racist, or anti-Semitic. Scurvy was more blunt: We expand songs so theyre horrible across all genders. Making pointed changes to rugby songs is one of the small ways in which gay-inclusive teams are rewriting the scripts for what rugby culture is supposed to look like. Straight players will sing gay songs, go to gay clubs for socials, and don drag for team benefits. For Binghams opening last week, one straight player dressed as a silver fairy and performed Superstition by Stevie Wonder. John Purdom, the Grizzlies assistant coach and a retired player, told me the accommodations go both ways. While a lot of socials involve viewings of RuPauls Drag Race or a trip to the gay bar, well host straight-player appreciation nights where well go bowling, or something we wouldnt normally do, he said. Were learning about each other in that respect how traditional masculinity in our world has transformed for our straight players, and how we transform for them. View this image  The Nashville Grizzlies practice before the Bingham Cup tournament at Centennial Park. Joe Buglewicz for BuzzFeed News Friday had been a day of buildup, of acclimation the first few games of pool play, the competition not yet life or death. By Saturday, the mood had shifted. The DJ was blasting Bieber. Contributions from the Nashville community were visible everywhere: a local BBQ tent for the lunch crowd, a stand for free HIV testing, and custom-made field goals designed and constructed by Grizzlies secretary Thomas Hormbys elderly father, Dave, who watched every one of his sons games sitting atop an orange ladder he toted from field to field. When Id been watching the Grizzlies B team on Friday, Jason Crowley of the As had fractured his scapula; everyone prayed today that theyd paid their dues to the injury gods. There were ambulances hovering expectantly in the far parking lot, just in case. A girl in army print cargo pants and big sunglasses, standing on the sidelines of the Grizzlies A teams first game of the day, was telling a friend about how she has to carry tampons for her boyfriend so he can shove them up his bloody nose, should such a situation arise. Today, the stakes were high playoff qualifications loomed. The Grizzlies goofed around a bit less before taking the pitch, looking serious and ready for a fight. They were facing off against the C team from Londons Kings Cross Steelers, which started the first ever gay-inclusive team in 1995. One of the Steelers later told me their team took up an entire dorm in Vanderbilt, since so many of their players (who total over 200, from over a dozen different nationalities) had come to compete. Theyd brought along dozens of their family and friends, too, which meant the Steelers had the biggest fanbase of any team present at Bingham, aside from the Grizzlies. You couldnt walk around the fields without hearing STEEEE-LLUUuuuUURS being screamed by an extremely enthusiastic Brit (or 20 of them). But the Grizzlies fought their way to an early lead; even when they were ahead, Josh kept them in check. Whats the score, boys? he yelled after their first try. Zerozero! they yelled back. After playing the first half, Stan Schklar spent the second hollering at his team from the sidelines, when he wasnt being approached by a friend to take a selfie. The Steelers game came to an end, Grizzlies ahead 177. But the A teams good spirits were short-lived. Later that day, in an absolutely bitter match against Colorado Rush, they lost an early lead in the last few seconds of the game to finish in an agonizing 1412 defeat. Scurvy ran up to me afterward, blood streaming from a gash above his eyebrow. Stitches, do you think? he asked me grimly. He was seething from the loss. At least I made my fucking tackle. I told him yeah, that seriously looked like stitches. And maybe even a concussion? I dont get concussions, he said. View this image  A Melbourne Chargers player has his fingers taped during their final match against the Sydney Convicts. Joe Buglewicz for BuzzFeed News Scurvy showed up for the As game against Toronto Muddy York Sunday morning, shirtless and wearing a pair of khaki shorts and bright orange glasses; he wouldnt be booting up today. He had 17 stitches. Hed tried to convince his doctor to let him play, but his skull had been visible. He stood dutifully on the sidelines, sporting the edgily shaved-sides haircut hed gotten for the tournament, unfailingly cheerful. It was the hottest day yet, not a single cloud in the scorching sky. An exhausted player lay on the ground beneath the bleachers, getting an IV for dehydration. Guys were freely peeing in the bushes around the fields, not daring to go into porta-potties that had been stewing for three days in the unforgiving sun. A breezy 15-nothing win against Muddy York put the Grizzlies in the running for the Hoagland Shield, named after Alice, who was swiftly on the scene to take a group picture. The Grizzlies final game drew their biggest crowd yet. The entire B team, which had ended its tournament run after a 1917 loss to Dallas Lost Souls, was there for support. A lot of the guys stripped to their bare chests, some revealing farmers tans that had evolved into full-out blistering sunburns. A young woman named Ella, who played rugby at Alabama before becoming a pastry chef, heard a rugby tournament was coming to Nashville; the Grizzlies have now gained a new fan. And there was a guy in futuristic-looking blue sunglasses and gingham shorts, who had come up from Memphis to support some of his friends on the team. He looked admiringly out over the field as the Grizzlies and the Dallas Diablos warmed up. Kind of cool you dont just see the Fire Island kinds of sculpted bodies, huh? he mused. He was right: While the players tended to be bigger guys, there were all kinds of bodies out there, the speedy little backs and the hulking forwards, all exhibiting different sorts of strength. Roy Wayne McCoy II, a hooker for the B team in his mid-twenties whose baby-round face is half hidden by an enormously bushy beard, had told me earlier that when he took his straight girlfriends to beer busts, they whispered to him, confused. Theyll be like, So how do you know which ones are gay? he said. And Im like, All of them that are here are gay. Because were at the gay bar. Its kind of strange when you go to the events, and you explain, yeah, the majority of these people are gay, and theyre like, But they look like they can beat up anybody! For so many of the men I spoke with, playing rugby was in part about proving to the world that there is no such thing, really, as looking gay. Gay rugby is rugby. There are as many different kinds of people playing and excelling at this sport as there are different kinds of queer people in the world. Right now, excelling at rugby was the only thing that mattered. Who are we? yelled coach Jimmy Arredondo. GRIZZLIES. There was also a less classy cheer, which theyd picked up as a slogan for the weekend: EXPLOIT THEIR HOLES. Off the kick, the Grizzlies were losing their rucks, getting pushed back, back, back. After someone got pushed out of bounds, there was a lineout to Dallas, which promptly won it. The Dallas defense was showing up right out the gate: They won a scrum, won ruck after ruck. Then, Chris Ursery, the Grizzlies star back, stole a glorious breakaway for a try, shifting the tone of the game. Go sports! yelled a group of Grizzlies fans in the bleachers. Great job sportsing! A try means a goal, right? Futuristic Glasses asked, jumping up and down as he cheered. The game surged with moments of preciseness and control that kept collapsing into a brutal, wild messiness, back 10, back 10, everyones adrenaline spiking, the coaches screaming, the scrums groaning under the weight of so many sweaty men, the hits so hard we in the stands could feel them in our bones. The Grizzlies were up by 8 when the whistle blew: 3224, thats it, done. Theyd won. Come on, Nashville! shouted someone from the bleachers. The pitch swelled, fit to burst with people: ruggers and fans, Nashvillians and Europeans, winners and losers, queer guys and straight girls and straight guys and queer girls, lovers and mentors and friends. The Grizzlies were in a tangle in the center of it all, hugging each other so tightly it looked as though they were afraid theyd never be able to hug each other again. The tears were abundant. Stan was grabbing every guy he could see, his face bathed in sweat and tears. There is something raw, something deeply and agelessly primal, about playing rugby particularly with people you care about. People you love. Youre lifting them into the air, pushing them forward, slamming guys out of their path, linking together into a giant mass and moving together as one. It feels, in so many ways, like life or death, like youve gone into battle, like youre smashing and clawing and hitting your way to a breathless victory that exists, somehow, outside of time and space. Your bodys ravaged but you keep peeling yourself off the ground, getting up and getting up and getting up, rejoining the fight even though you feel like youre about to be split in half. Because the people beside you, covered in blood and sweat and mud they need you. And you need them, too. Jon Glassmeyer, the Grizzlies vet who spearheaded the proposal to bring Bingham to Nashville, presented the Grizzlies with their shield. Josh and a few other players held it high overhead. Its not fair! Scurvy yelled, jumping to reach it. Im not as tall! But he was laughing, smiling, sad he hadnt gotten to play but thrilled nonetheless that his team went in there and did the goddamn thing. There was still plenty of rugby left in the day: The finals would see a whole bunch of Australians duke it out for the Bingham Cup. The Melbourne Chargers, in a 207 win, would unseat the Sydney Convicts, the four-time Bingham winners, and add their name to the trophy for the first time. The bustling players village would slowly but surely empty out, players piling onto school buses to take them back to Vanderbilt while they sang and drank beer like overgrown camp kids. But for now, the Grizzlies had only celebrating to do and a responsibility to fulfill. Josh McCluey, one of the wings, had scored his first try, and rules are rules: Hed have to strip down naked and run around the goalposts while his teammates poured water all over him. (My teams tradition was just making girls chug foot-cocktail beers from cleats after losing their try virginity, but the Grizzlies only employ shooting the boot for flubbing a rugby lyric at socials scoring a try called for far more serious measures.) So, after making sure there werent any kids around, thats precisely what Josh did. View this image  The Nashville Grizzlies celebrate after winning the Hoagland Shield against the Dallas Diablos at the Bingham Cup. Joe Buglewicz for BuzzFeed News Later that night, at Marathon Music Works for the closing ceremonies, all the teams were dressed to the nines: the Grizzlies in Hawaiian shirts, Irish guys in head-to-toe green, some guys in suits, some guys in shorts, and both a Left and a Right Shark. While everyone loaded their plates, I chatted with two of the green-bedecked Irishmen, who were both retired from playing and looked to be in their mid-forties. One of them, with a salt-and-pepper beard and braces on his lower teeth, told me that his gay-inclusive team is struggling to hold onto its star players. Some of the best players on the gay Irish teams are being poached by the straight teams! Theres a lot of competition in Ireland, he said, which means there are plenty of teams competing for greatness. The only thing thats different about us is we like guys, he added, shrugging. The DJ played Hello and hundreds of ruggers began to sing along: It was the most rousing Adele rendition Id ever heard, their voices rumbling in the huge room. Then there were the speeches preceding the awards. Marks mom took the stage again. Being gay and being strong are powerful forces the world needs, she said. AL-ICE! AL-ICE! everyone chanted, their love for her clear and strong as ever. Jeff Wilson, the 20122016 chairman of International Gay Rugby, gave a shout-out to the mayor and her work in progressing LGBT acceptance particularly for rainbow-ifying the Korean Veterans Bridge, a large focal point of downtown Nashville, to welcome the ruggers that weekend. My grandmother was born in Tennessee in 1924, he said, and shed shit her pants if she knew Mayor Barry lit up the bridge for a gay rugby tournament. He later told me by phone that he hopes the next Bingham will have a womens component. 6 of our clubs has womens sides in multiple countries, he said. Theyve been around for awhile. Its just question of commitment and marketing resources. As both men and womens rugby continue to grow in international popularity, its hard not to look at a tournament like this and want back in on the action. As I spoke with players throughout the weekend, they all encouraged me to take up rugby again, which Ive only avoided because of how high your commitment to the sport needs to be. Its one thing to drag your beaten-up body to a couple college classes a day, but quite another to accommodate rugby around the annoying trappings of adulthood, like responsibilities and jobs. But they all told me it was worth it. Scurvy explained why: Two weeks ago, I was in a really bad car wreck in Kentucky. I rolled my car four times. After the crash, he texted the Grizzlies group thread. They sent someone up for me. I knew that would happen because were a family. Thats worth everything. It really is. To know that a guy can get out of work early and drive 2 and a half hours to pick you up because theyre concerned about you. Because they care about you. The family feel had always been reward enough. The Grizzlies arent used to more tangible awards. Theyve won a couple prizes in past Binghams, but only when their teams were supplemented with whores (foreign players who step in when a team could use stronger numbers). But tonight, Scurvy accepted the Hoagland Shield the fourth out of six awards in Binghams middle tier, the kind of placement the Grizzlies had worked so long and so tirelessly for. And this was their first time winning a tournament with 100% Grizzly manpower. It was a victory worth celebrating. After the closing ceremonies, Play, one of Nashvilles gay bars, hosted all the players for one last hurrah. There was the usual mix of superb drag queen performances and exceedingly subpar ones. It could have been any gay bar on any weekend night in the country, except perhaps the clientele this time skewed a bit buffer than average. The tragedy at Pulse was still a couple weeks away here, tonight, there was no fear. There was only exuberance, and joyous abandonment, and enough pride to fill a thousand gay bars: pride in being rugby players, being gay, being here, being present, being a part of something bigger than any one man. After a weekend of putting their bodies and hearts through the wringer, ruggers danced to Rihanna under the spinning rainbow lights.

aS"The minister threatened to mobilize a mob and a large police group to beat up anyone who shows up for pride tomorrow. View this image  Uganda Pride in August 2014 Isaac Kasamani / AFP / Getty Images Organizers in Uganda have canceled a pride parade scheduled to be held on Saturday after a tense meeting between a senior government official and one of Ugandas top human rights lawyers. LGBT pride events have been held without incident in Uganda for the past few years, even during the tense period after the countrys Constitutional Court invalidated a sweeping anti-LGBT law in 2014. Saturdays parade was scheduled to be held in a private space in Munyonyo, outside of Kampala, the countrys capital. But police raided the Mr. and Miss Pride pageant on Thursday night at the Venom nightclub and detained several of Ugandas most visible LGBT activists for several hours. On Friday, lawyer Nick Opiyo of Chapter 4 Uganda met with Ethics Minister Simon Lokodo to discuss the raid. Following the meeting, Opiyo told BuzzFeed News that Lokodo had threatened to bring opposition to the event to the streets, so organizers decided it should be canceled. Frank Mugisha of Sexual Minorities Uganda, a local NGO, confirmed to BuzzFeed News that the parade on Saturday was cancelled and postponed at least until the following week. We decided to suspend it because of the risks to personal safety, Opiyo said. The minister threatened to mobilize a mob and a large police group to beat up anyone who shows up for pride tomorrow. We will engage the government next week with a view of holding the pride parade at another date soon. This, Opiyo said, was a breach of an agreement the Ugandan government had reached with governments of donor nations to Uganda especially the United States and United Kingdom which had helped clear the way for pride events in recent years. He appears to be operating parallel to any agreements that may exist between the government and the LGBTI community and donors, adding that Lokodo barred a representative from the US embassy from participating in the Friday morning meeting. Hes threatening to mobilize. Asked whether the US government considered the Ugandan government to have violated an agreement between the two countries by interrupting pride and if this could have an affect on US aid including ongoing support for the Ugandan military State Department press director Elizabeth Trudeau said in an email, We urge the Ugandan authorities to safeguard the freedoms of all Ugandans under the law.

aS"Several of Ugandas leading LGBT activists were detained during the raid. View this image  People waving Ugandan and rainbow flags take part in the Gay Pride parade in Entebbe on August 8, 2015 Isaac Kasamani / AFP / Getty Images Ugandan police interrupted the Mr. and Miss Pride Uganda pageant at Kampalas Venom nightclub on Thursday night, detaining several well-known LGBT activists for about three hours before releasing them without charge. Around 20 to 25 people were arrested, those detained told BuzzFeed News after their release. That number included Pepe Julian Onziema and Frank Mugisha of Sexual Minorities Uganda, who both posted on their Twitter timelines that they were being placed under arrest at around 10:30 p.m. local time. Clare Byarugaba, a former co-coordinator of the coalition opposing anti-LGBT legislation in Uganda whos now on the staff of the human rights group Chapter 4 Uganda, was also among those taken into custody, Chapter 4 director Nick Opiyo told BuzzFeed News. Arrested I am arrested by Ugandan police Those released reported violence from police in interviews with BuzzFeed News. They were beating people mostly the trans women, Adebayo Katiiti Phiona, who won the title of Mr. Pride in 2015, told BuzzFeed News. A police person even stepped on a trans woman. Pepe Julian Onziema of Sexual Minorities Uganda told BuzzFeed News police said the event was held without proper permission from police, a claim he emphatically denied. Theres no way we would hold an event without a clearance, Onziema said, saying organizers had always communicated with police before holding Pride events for the last four years. They dont care as long as the word homosexuality is mentioned. As soon as that is mentioned, everything else ceases and [police feel they] have to act. Most of the 200 people attending the pride event were allowed to leave the club, according to Adrian Jjuuko of the legal aid group Human Rights Awareness and Promotion Forum (HRAPF); activists were primarily targeted for arrest. One of HRAPFs lawyers was among those arrested, said Jjuuko, who did not want her name published. Jjuuko said that while police have occasionally interrupted LGBT cultural events and trainings, Ugandas pride events have largely gone without interruption in the past few years even during the height of controversy following the Constitutional Courts August 2014 nullification of a sweeping anti-LGBT law passed earlier that year. Thursdays arrests come amidst widespread allegations of police brutality against supporters of jailed opposition leader Kizza Besigye following the re-election of President Yoweri Museveni to a fifth term as president. I think theyre also trying to cover up the criticism for police brutality thats going on the country now they want to cover it up with a gay story, Jjuuko said.

aS"It shows us all, those affected and those who can relate, that this is a sensitive issue that many dont talk or speak out about. View this image  Going through airport security can be stressful for everyone, but for trans or gender-nonconforming people going through the body scanner can prove to be an extra uncomfortable process. According to the TSA website, an agent must designate each traveler as male or female, enabling the machines software to flag anyone who doesnt match up to the set outline of those two genders. Sapir, whose ID lists her as female, told BuzzFeed News that usually when she goes through airport security the machine always flags her. Fortunately, I have not had a traumatic or awful TSA experience like a lot of trans people have had. Ive just had awkwardness, she said. Happens every time, I say. Why do you think? she says. Because I wear boxer briefs. Oh, what is the gender you would like to be identified as? Well, I consider myself gender nonconforming. I am female and also trans masculine. The TSA encourages trans travelers to purchase reservations with the same name and gender that appears on their government-issued ID, but for many trans people changing the gender that appears on their ID from the gender they were assigned at birth is a difficult process. Now the machine is wondering about Boobs, we say in unison laughing some more. Lac then asked how Sapir would like to identify so she could conduct the proper pat-down. You get to decide how you are identified, she said. View this image  Following the pat down, which proved she had no contraband on her person, Sapir took a moment to thank the TSA agent. Your thoughtfulness really means the world, she told Lac. I love people. We should be kind to everyone, Lac responded. Im a natural people person, Lac, who also works as a passenger support specialist (PSS) for the TSA, told BuzzFeed News. My intuitive nature took over and I handled the situation in a way Id like to be treated. View this image  I did not think this would go viral, I am so surprised, said Sapir of the response. It was important to lift up her professionalism and the humanity in her professionalism. Ive received lots of comments from trans people, but also from diabetics or other folks who have medical issues who have also had inconvenient experiences with TSA screening. We all can benefit from humane treatment. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .  Tagged:social, flying, trans, transgender, tsa Hey!

aS"Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, facing ethics charges, had filed a federal lawsuit asking to be reinstated to his seat on the states supreme court. A federal judge tossed the case out of federal court on Thursday. View this image  Butch Dill / AP WASHINGTON A federal judge on Thursday dismissed Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moores federal lawsuit against his states Judicial Inquiry Commission, which has ethics charges pending against him. While the charges relating to actions Moore took to fight same-sex couples marriage rights in the state are pending, Moore is not allowed to sit on the states Supreme Court under the states Constitution. Moore then filed the federal lawsuit in May asking to be reinstated to the court, alleging the constitutional provision violated his federal civil rights. U.S. District Court Judge W. Harold Albritton III dismissed Moores case on Thursday, finding it appropriate for the federal court to abstain from hearing it while the state proceedings are ongoing because Moores federal case, if resolved in his favor, would interfere with ongoing state proceedings. Moore faces removal from the bench if the Alabama Court of the Judiciary rules against Moore in response to the commissions charges. The six charges against Moore are the result of an administrative order Moore issued on Jan. 6 in his capacity as the head of the states courts. The order purported to tell probate judges in the state that they remained subject to an earlier state court order that they uphold the states ban on same-sex couples marriages despite the U.S. Supreme Courts June 2015 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges that declared such bans to be unconstitutional and a subsequent federal court order that applied specifically to Alabamas ban and its probate judges. In issuing his Administrative Order of January 6, 2016, Chief Justice Moore flagrantly disregarded and abused his authority as the chief administrative office of Alabamas judicial branch in substituting his individual opinion for that of the Court, the commission wrote. Earlier this week, the Montgomery Advertiser reported that the hearing on the case is scheduled for Sept. 28. That hearing, however, only will go forward if the Court of the Judiciary first rules against Moores request that the case against him be dismissed. A hearing on that request is set for Aug. 8. In a statement, Moores lawyer in the case, Liberty Counsels Mat Staver, said they are considering whether to appeal Thursdays ruling. We will discuss the matter with our client about appealing the ruling, Staver said. We are ready for Mondays hearing to address the politically-motivated charges filed against Chief Justice Moore.

aS"A 5-3 vote to put the trial courts injunction on hold. View this image  The courtroom of the U.S. Supreme Court. Jonathan Ernst / Reuters WASHINGTON The Supreme Court put an order allowing a transgender student to use school restrooms in accordance with his gender identity on hold while the high court decides whether it will take the case. The Supreme Courts action likely means that the student, Gavin Grimm, will not be allowed to use the male restroom when he returns to his Virginia school in the fall. The stay of the injunction in the students challenge to the Gloucester County School Boards policy was granted on a 5-3 vote, with Justice Stephen Breyer joining his more conservative colleagues in granting the stay. The order is not a ruling on the eventual outcome of the case itself, nor is it a definitive statement on whether the Supreme Court will even hear the school boards appeal. The stay will, however, remain in effect at least until the court decides whether it will hear the appeal a decision that is not expected to be made any sooner than the beginning of the courts new term in October. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled earlier this year that the Obama administrations interpretation of regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 as providing protections for transgender students is a permissible interpretation. After that ruling, the trial court judge in the case issued an injunction prohibiting the school board from implementing its policy limiting restroom use to students biological sex. The board had passed the policy in 2014, essentially targeting Grimm, who is the only out transgender student in the district. Breyer wrote that he joined in granting the stay, as well as recalling the mandate of the appeals court decision, as a courtesy because four other justices Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito were voting to grant the stay and granting a stay will preserve the status quo (as of the time the Court of Appeals made its decision). Breyer cited to his dissent in Medelln v. Texas a death penalty case in which he was unable to secure a so-called courtesy fifth vote for a stay of execution as further explanation of why he granted the stay in Wednesdays decision. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan would have denied the stay request. The court notes that the stay will remain in effect until it decides whether to grant the school boards forthcoming certiorari petition asking the Supreme Court to review the lower courts decision. If the court agrees to hear the case, the stay will remain in effect until there is a ruling in the case. If the court decides not to hear the case, the stay will end at that time. The school board issued a brief statement, noting that it welcomes the Supreme Courts decision as the new school year approaches. The Board continues to believe that its resolution of this complex matter fully considered the interests of all students and parents in the Gloucester County school system. The ACLU, which is representing Grimm, expressed disappointment at the Supreme Courts action. We are disappointed that the court has issued a stay and that Gavin will have to begin another school year isolated from his peers and stigmatized by the Gloucester County school board just because hes a boy who is transgender, ACLU senior staff attorney Joshua Block said in a statement. We remain hopeful that Gavin will ultimately prevail.

aS"This tactic is as old as the hills. View this image  Paul Faith / AFP / Getty Images Brady, who is in Australia to assist the yes campaign in a national vote on marriage, told BuzzFeed News he is already seeing the types of misdirections that cropped up in the Irish campaign, which included linking same-sex marriage to adoption and surrogacy. They kept saying [surrogacy law is linked to marriage law] until the independent chair of the referendum commission had to come out and say This is a separate area of law, it is not connected to the question you are being asked to vote on, Brady explained. This tactic is as old as the hills if you cant persuade people, persuade them of something else.

He is about to make [LGBTI anti-bullying program] Safe Schools compulsory in all Victorian high schools next year, allowing boys who identify as girls to be in the girls toilets and all of this fluid gender ideology material, Shelton said. Brady told BuzzFeed News such comments show the no campaign has literally given up on trying to win the argument about marriage. The game is over. They know Australians are for it so how can we make it about something else? he said. You can deliberately try and fool people.

aS'Katrina Pierson is a the official national campaign spokeswoman for Donald J. Trump, who has argued he is a friend to the LGBT community. View this image  Reuters / Brian Snyder Katrina Pierson has become the face of the Donald Trump campaign on cable news, representing the Republican presidential candidate who has declared that he is really the friend of the LGBT community and said LGBT is starting to like Donald Trump very much lately. But Pierson, the official national campaign spokesperson for the Trump campaign, did not express such warm sentiments to gays in 2012. Gay is not normal, accept that, she said in a Twitter conversation at the time. Further, she argued that if a same-sex couple got married in a church, it still would not be marriage, and questioned where the US Constitution addressed marriage equality. @michael_atx You will never for acceptance, but you could win coexistance. Gay is not normal, accept that. @michael_atx I didn\'t realize that #marriage was in the U.S. Constitution? Did I miss that page? Federal license? @tedcruz #txsen @michael_atx Even getting "married" in a church doesn\'t make it a marriage. In June of last year, the US Supreme Court found that bans on same-sex couples marrying violated the Constitution under the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the 14th Amendment thereby making marriage equality national policy. BuzzFeed News asked Pierson how her comments squared with Trumps overtures to LGBT voters. Its a long reach to go back to 2012 to try to create a new hit piece and call it relevant, Pierson wrote to BuzzFeed News in an email. Youll also find that as a grassroots volunteer for multiple campaigns, its quite common that Twitter is a platform to promote/defend the policies and values of the candidates at the time. Many times, its about engaging trolls which can lead to humorous and sarcastic banter. Im sure youll also find that the positions/values of the candidates are not necessarily a sole reflection of the individual promoting or supporting said candidate, she added.

aS"If you are against same-sex marriage, I have written this book for you. View this image  David Mcnew / Getty Images He said You ought to write that, and I said I will, Ritchie told BuzzFeed News. It stuck in my head for eight years. In Faith, Love & Australia: The Conservative Case For Same-Sex Marriage, launched last month, Ritchie argues that same-sex marriage is a reflection, not a flouting, of conservative ideals. At the centre of the book, published by Connor Court, is a core belief: Same-sex marriage strengthens the social fabric, rather than attempting to tear it. Family is the foundation of the social fabric, Ritchie told BuzzFeed News. There are three ways to join a family. You can be born into it, adopted into it, or marry into it. We say to gay and lesbian people with partners of 10, 20, 30 years theyve been at the dinner table for that long you might, by heart, be part of the family, but by law you never will. As a conservative, I dont buy that. View this image  Stefan Postles / Getty Images It was under Tony Abbott that the policy of a national vote on marriage equality was hatched during a five-hour-long party room meeting in August 2015. Prior to that meeting, both Tony Abbott and opposition leader Bill Shorten had noted their opposition to a national vote on the matter. Ritchie wouldnt be drawn on whether he believes Malcolm Turnbulls reluctance to defend the policy with vigour stems from that hasty decision making. Tony Abbott staffers always get in trouble when they talk about Malcolm Turnbull! he said. I would expect that if theres a plebiscite, the prime minister will be a vocal proponent of change because he believes in it. Regardless of the outcome, Ritchies reservations about the plebiscite remain. My instinct is when you put 226 members of parliament together, their job is to think about issues, he said. Its to understand the different components, the stakeholders, to come to a view about themselves, the community, the nation. Im a believer in the parliament, because I think you get the best decision making. View this image  Connor Court He cited bans on interracial marriage and various ways women were oppressed by the institution as elements that needed to change. If those changes didnt occur, no one would get married today, he said. The reason the institution is strong is because it has gently evolved with the times, and I point to this as one of those gentle evolutions. View this image  Justin Sullivan / Getty Images Every week in Tony Abbotts office, we had a triage system to figure out which letters should get personal attention, he explained. Every week, thered be letters from kids talking about their family, wanting their family to be like everyone elses. There was a beauty in what they were writing lots of spelling mistakes, as I said, and a misplaced belief the prime minister was all-powerful, all that. But its about giving them the same sort of institutional support that every other Australian kid has.Ritchie said many of the conversations revolve around what ifs. What if your son, daughter, grandson, granddaughter, you found out they were gay? he said. This question prompts a countenance change. This book is saying to conservative people Im not going to shout at you, he added. If you are against same-sex marriage, I have written this book for you. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

Couldn't be happier, two longtime White House staffers, two great guys. Vice President Joe Biden officiated a same-sex wedding Monday, marrying two White House staffers at the vice presidential residence in Washington, DC. Biden tweeted a photo of himself performing the wedding. Bidens office said in a statement to BuzzFeed News that the wedding between Brian Mosteller and Joe Mahshie took place Monday at 4 p.m. It was the first time Biden had performed a wedding and came after Mosteller and Mahshie asked him to officiate. The vice president obtained a temporary certification from the District of Columbia for the ceremony, his office said. Mosteller is the director of Oval Office operations and in February was the subject of a Washington Post profile that touted his ability to basically read President Obamas mind. According to Mahshies LinkedIn profile, he is a trip coordinator for Michelle Obama. The men were married in a small ceremony attended by family members. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"A legal challenge against the NHSs decision not to provide the drug to men who have sex with men has been successful. But there are still other hurdles before the drug can be made available. View this image  Justin Sullivan / Getty A drug which prevents HIV could be made available on the NHS in England after a successful legal challenge by a leading HIV/AIDS charity. NHS England decided in May that it would not offer pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a treatment that stops people from contracting HIV. Less than a week later, the National AIDS Trust (NAT) challenged the decision in the courts. Deborah Gold, chief executive of the NAT, said in a statement that the ruling was fantastic news and vindication for the many people who were let down by NHS Englands decision. However, the NHS has said that the decision means that it may no longer be able to afford to pay for some other treatments. The decision hinged on whether PrEP counts as HIV prevention or HIV treatment. NHS England argues that while treating patients who have HIV is the NHSs responsibility, under the Health and Social Care Act 2012 preventing people from catching the virus is the role of local authorities. The judge, Justice Green, said in his ruling that NHS England had erred indeciding that it has no power or duty to commission PrEP. Inmy judgment it has a broad preventative role (including in relation to HIV), he said. He ruled that the process for deciding whether PrEP should be made available should be restarted immediately, beginning with a public consultation by the NHSs Clinical Priorities Advisory Group (CPAG). He gave permission for an appeal against the ruling, and NHS England has confirmed that it will appeal. The public consultation will go ahead immediately and will only be stopped if NHS England wins its appeal, but the treatment wont be commissioned until the appeal is resolved. PrEP uses a drug called Truvada. The NHS already provides post-exposure prophylaxis, PEP, which is a combination of Truvada and another drug called Isentress. The NAT argued in a legal letter that the two treatments perform similar medical functions and both should be considered treatment. View this image  Facebook Biologically they [PEP and PrEP] do exactly the same thing, Deborah Gold, chief executive of the NAT, told BuzzFeed News in June. In both cases you take them because you think youre at risk of HIV, whether its before you have sex or afterwards. If you havent been exposed to HIV youve just taken a drug thats had no effect on you. It only has an effect if you have been exposed to the virus. The way HIV works is first of all you become infected with it, then it replicates within your body. This drug doesnt stop you from becoming infected it stops the virus from replicating, thus allowing your immune system to fight it off. So, actually its treating the person with HIV. Its treatment. But NHS England said in a statement that it had been advised it was not legally permitted to provide the treatment, saying: Local authorities are the responsible commissioner for HIV prevention services. It added that if it made PrEP available it would be at risk of legal challenge from providers of rival treatments. The decision does not mean that the NHS has to provide PrEP, just that it is legally allowed to. The drug will still have to be assessed for cost-effectiveness, just as any other treatment would be. The NHS said in May that there is no guarantee that a legal change would lead the health service to invest millions of pounds in PrEP over new treatments and interventions in other service areas which are also competing for funding. NHS England said in a statement following the ruling that in order to ensure that sufficient funding remains available for PrEP, funding for some other treatments recommended by CPAG can no longer be confirmed. Ian Green, chief executive of the HIV charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, said in a statement: It is a vindication for the community after a long fight but it should never have come to this. Because of the mess and delays created by NHS England, people at risk of HIV have spent the past 18 months fighting to be heard. Meanwhile, 17 people have been diagnosed with HIV with every day that has passed. Will Nutland of the PrEP education and campaign website Prepster told BuzzFeed News it was an excellent ruling by the judge but that it is a shame that NHS England will waste more time and public money seeking an appeal. The World Health Organization recommended in 2014 that PrEp should be offered to people at substantial risk of contracting HIV, including men who have sex with men. PrEP treatment involves one pill taken once a day, and costs about 400 a month per patient. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The motions are denied, US District Court Judge Carlton Reeves wrote. View this image  Rogelio V. Solis / AP WASHINGTON The federal judge in Mississippi who halted enforcement of the states new anti-LGBT religious exemption law declined on Monday to put his ruling on hold while the state appeals the ruling. Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant had asked US District Court Judge Carlton Reeves to issue a stay of his preliminary injunction order during the appeal. If granted, the state would have allowed the state to enforce the law during its appeal of the ruling against the law. Bryant signed the bill, HB 1523, into law on April 5. The bill provided protections for individuals, religious organizations, and certain businesses who take actions due to their sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions regarding same-sex marriage or any sex outside straight marriage. It also provided similar protections for those who object to transgender people. In dismissing the states argument for why a stay should be granted and reiterating that he believed the plaintiffs would ultimately succeed in their challenge to the law Reeves was abrupt. [I]ssuing a marriage license to a gay couple is not like being forced into armed combat or to assist with an abortion. Matters of life and death are sui generis. If movants truly believe that providing services to LGBT citizens forces them to tinker with the machinery of death, their animus exceeds anything seen in Romer, Windsor, or the marriage equality cases, he wrote referencing the US Supreme Courts earlier gay rights cases. The motions are denied, Reeves wrote in Mondays order. The baton is now passed. Bryant already has asked the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals to grant a stay of Reeves order.

aS'After the annual celebration was abruptly cancelled by organizers, who cited security concerns, the citys LGBT community is pulling together to host a replacement event, the Executive Director of Clevelands LGBT Community Center tells BuzzFeed News. Because of the changing social climate, Cleveland Pride did not have enough time to engage in the development of awareness programs and training that we believe is critical in todays environment, president and CEO of Cleveland Pride, Inc., Todd J. Saporito, said in the statement. Therefore, we regretfully cancelled our 28th annual parade, rally and festival this year. The event had already been rescheduled once to accommodate for the Republican National Convention, which was held in Cleveland during the week of July 18th. Kerry McCormack, councilman for Ward 3, told Cleveland.com that the decision to cancel hadnt involved city officials. The city safety forces, government and people were prepared, excited and very supportive of this event, he said. View this image  In a phone interview on Monday with BuzzFeed News, Harris explained that she and her team members know as much about the decision behind the cancellation as the public does. We came together with a representative from Cleveland Pride, Inc., who shared the news with us, Harris said. We asked why, and we got the same answers that everyone else got in the press release. She added that many of the groups present at that meeting asked if there was anything they could do to change the decision and they were told no. A public information officer with the Cleveland PD told BuzzFeed News the department would show up wherever a group requested their presence, though they are not directly involved in the planning of any new Pride events. There were no known credible threats to the Pride event at the time of the original events cancellation, she said. We should probably be making a bigger deal about Cleveland Pride being canceled due to a "changing social climate." I\'m so sad cleveland pride was cancelled. If we could get more security all week for the RNC than why cant we get more for our citizens Ok so who\'s in Cleveland, fill me in, why did they cancel pride? What\'s the tea. Who\'s responsible. Several organizations outside the city, including Pittsburgh Pride, have reached out to Harris to offer support for the new event. Terry DeCarlo, the executive director of the Orlando LGBT center, is among those who have reached out. In the wake of the tragic Pulse shooting in Orlando, Harris strongly believes visibility within the LGBT community is more important than ever. The group of LGBT organizers hope to release more information, and a definitive location, for the event as soon as details are confirmed. BuzzFeed News has reached out to Todd J. Saporito and Cleveland Pride for comment. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .  Tagged:cleveland, lgbt, pride Hey! This video may have privacy restrictions.

aS"US District Court Judge Thomas D. Schroeder pressed the state at a hearing on Monday to show how the law made anyone safer and whether it was necessary. He said he would rule soon on whether to suspend the law. View this image  North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory Chuck Burton / AP WINSTON-SALEM, North Carolina A federal judge expressed skepticism on Monday that North Carolina lawmakers were solving a legitimate safety problem when they passed a law that bans many transgender people from restrooms in government facilities that match their gender identity. US District Court Judge Thomas D. Schroeder also seemed flummoxed at one point by how the law could function in practical terms it requires people to use single-sex restrooms associated with the sex on their birth certificate, thereby making transgender people enter facilities that conflict with their identity and appearance. We would have people dressed like males, who consider themselves male, walking into the ladies room, he told a lawyer representing Gov. Pat McCrory. How on earth is that supposed to work? he asked. Schroeder was considering a request to suspend the law while its underlying legal merits are considered at a trial. I endeavor to make a decision as soon as I can, he told the courtroom. I know school is about to ramp up. In a hearing that stretched more than three hours, Schroeder asked lawyers from both sides how pre-existing state laws against indecent exposure, peeping, and trespassing could apply. Why arent those sufficient protection, or are they? he said. How does this law make us safer? And he asked whether the University of North Carolina should be named as a defendant at all. Yet he expressed concern for the privacy rights of young students, particularly girls, who could be exposed to seeing a transgender girls genitals which may appear male in locker rooms, showers, or changing facilities. He said there could be a heightened interest in protecting privacy if minors are involved, pointing out they are living through impressionable years. On March 23, Republican state lawmakers convened a one-day legislative session to pass House Bill 2 with the explicit goal of overriding an ordinance in Charlotte that would have protected LGBT people from discrimination in housing and public accommodations. McCrory and GOP lawmakers claimed the public accommodations portion of the citys ordinance posed a safety threat by allowing transgender women whom they called men to prey on women and girls, particularly in bathrooms. In addition to superseding Charlottes policy, the law stated that single-sex restrooms and locker rooms in public schools and government buildings may only be used by people with the corresponding sex listed on their birth certificate. Within days, a challenge was filed by a transgender student and a transgender employee at the University of North Carolina. Represented by lawyers from the ACLU and Lambda Legal, they argued that the law violated their constitutional and civil rights leaning on a growing body of court cases and legal interpretations that find transgender discrimination is a form of illegal sex discrimination. On Monday they went to court to ask that the law be suspended the furthest along of at least five lawsuits relating to the state law. Judge Schroeder has scheduled a full trial for November. Meanwhile, there is a parallel case before his court brought by the Department of Justice, which sued North Carolina to strike down the statute. Before the governors lawyer, Karl Bowers, could finish the first sentence of his oral argument on Monday, Judge Schroeder cut him off. What is the problem? Judge Schroeder began. Bowers said the Charlotte ordinance created an issue; by extending new rights for transgender people in restrooms, it compromised public safety and privacy. Is there any legislative record here of a problem that needed to be addressed? the judge pressed, asking if hearings or floor debates cited issues associated with transgender people using restrooms. Not that I am aware of, Bowers replied. Bowers said he would submit records from the day of proceedings on HB2. Judge Schroeder then inquired what ramifications would arise from suspending the law and returning to the status quo. Rather than answer, however, Bowers replied that he would turn the judges question on its head, saying that HB2 was reaffirming privacy. But the judge continued. Were other laws that ban nefarious activities such as indecent exposure not enough? he asked. Why arent those sufficient protection, or are they? he said. How does this law make us safer? Bowers answered, HB2 confirms the privacy rights of not being exposed to the genitals of someone of the opposite sex. But Schroeder pointed out that restrooms have partitions that prevent exposure to other peoples genitals. Not always, Bowers noted. Are there urinals in the ladies room? Schroeder rejoined. I am at a loss, unless someone strips down naked, which is a violation of the law [that already exists to ban such behaviors], as I understand it. When pressed on how HB2 would work, requiring transgender men use womens rooms, Bowers pointed out that some transgender people would continue to use the restroom that reflects their gender identity regardless of the law.Then why have it? said Schroeder. I dont understand. The legal challenge was filed in US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina on behalf of Joaqun Carcao, a transgender man who works at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; Payton Grey McGarry, a transgender man who is a student at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro; and Angela Gilmore, a lesbian who is the associate dean for academic affairs at North Carolina Central University. The ACLU of North Carolina and Equality North Carolina are also named as plaintiffs. Their underlying complaint argues that the law violates their rights to equal protection, privacy, and liberty under the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution and their civil rights under Title IX of the Education Amendments of of 1972. View this image  Dominic Holden For several years, federal agencies have interpreted Title IX which bans discrimination in publicly funded schools on the basis of sex as a ban on transgender discrimination as a form of sex discrimination. In another case involving a transgender student, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals found in April that the Education Department had deference to make that interpretation of Title IX. Several school districts have resisted that federal interpretation of Title IX. However, North Carolina is the first and only state to enact a law banning transgender students from school restrooms that correspond with their gender identity. In briefs submitted to the court, McCrorys lawyers have argued that Title IX applies to biological sex defined as the sex listed on a birth certificate and does not extend nondiscrimination protections on the basis gender identity. Meanwhile, House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate Pro Tempore Phil Berger, who intervened to join the case, argued in court documents that the ACLU was essentially attempting to abolish sex-segregated facilities entirely. Representing those two Republican lawmakers, attorney Kyle Duncan argued against an injunction on Monday. He bristled at the idea that letting transgender people use restrooms that match their gender would return North Carolina to the status quo, saying that the Obama administration has advanced its novel idea about Title IX only in recent years. It stretches credibility to the breaking point to suggest that was the status quo, said Duncan, making an alternate case that suspending HB2 would move away from a traditional understanding of facilities separated based on users biological sex. Judge Schroeder also struggled at times with the scope of sex discrimination. On the one hand, he said that separate facilities for males and females was inherently a form of discrimination. The University of North Carolina, which was also named as a defendant, argued that it was not enforcing the law and shouldnt be required to participate in these proceedings at all, said lawyer Noel Franciso. But Corey Stoughton, a lawyer for the US Department of Justices Civil Rights Division, argued that the university system should be remain as a defendant, in part because a Title IX claim could only be brought by an education institution that receives federal funds.Judge Schroeder invited the parties to submit briefs by the end of the week on whether the University of North Carolina should be removed from the proceedings. It is not entirely clear to me why they are in the case, he noted. You could sue every agency in the state with a bathroom.Judge Schroeder repeatedly got stuck on who has authority to enforce the law, given that the statute doesnt explain how state agencies would take action against violators. Its not clear to me how the law is supposed to work, other than agencies are supposed to follow it. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"They dont get to dictate which bathrooms trans people use. View this image  Rising, a Calgary trans woman, was in town for a wedding when she headed out to Corona Tavern with friends. She told BuzzFeed Canada it started with a weird look from the bouncer when she showed her ID. View on Instagram She said the bouncer asked invasive questions like whether or not shed had surgeries and how long shed been on hormone treatments. View this image  The bouncer said he would escort her to the mens washroom if she felt unsafe, but continued to say the womens facilities were off limits. Theres no way I would walk into a mens washroom and someone would think that I belong there, said Rising. Soon after, Rising said a female bartender told her that she would make other women uncomfortable in the womens washroom. She said if the owner had been there, he would have thrown me out for just being there. Not wanting to leave her friends who were supportive and apologizing for the bars behaviour Rising stayed at the bar but avoided the washroom. View this image  When I found out about the sign I was horrified, said Rising. But the issue wasnt simply about hurt feelings; she pointed out that the bars washroom policy is actually illegal. Transgender folks are protected under Albertas human rights legislation after the passing of Bill 7 last December. They dont get to dictate which bathrooms trans people use. Their bathrooms dont work in a little corner of the country where these laws dont apply. View this image  First, the bar began the statement by claiming theyve had numerous complaints about males going into the womens washroom since the passing of Bill 7. The clientele that we serve are often under the influence of alcohol and some young men who are not transgendered [sic] have been claiming to be, to enter the womens washroom, the statement said. The bar also said it has no bias against those who are LGBTQ. Rising said that while gender-neutral washrooms are great, especially for nonbinary and genderqueer folks, everyone still has the right to use the mens or womens washrooms if they prefer. The bars Facebook page has now been flooded with one-star ratings and reviews criticizing how they handled the situation. View this image  There is a really sad narrative that is usually out around trans people and their lives. I have a really great life with a lot of positive people in it, she said. As for the people who worry about trans folks in the bathroom, Rising has a message for them. If they feel unsafe, maybe it should be them who are not going out, not trans men and women.

aS"Exclusive: The NHS is stopping participants in a major study into the drug Truvada from having further access to it a move that Britains biggest HIV charity said would lead some to become infected. Justin Sullivan / Getty Images People at very high risk of contracting HIV who took part in a groundbreaking NHS study into the drug that prevents the virus have been told that they will no longer be given the medication, BuzzFeed News can reveal. The decision to stop supplying the drug to the participants now that the study is over comes despite indications from NHS England earlier this year that this would not happen. Britains leading HIV charity has warned that it is a statistical certainty that some of these participants will now become HIV-positive. The 545 gay and bisexual men who volunteered for the PROUD study were selected on the basis that they were particularly vulnerable to infection and were willing to take one pill called Truvada a day, in an HIV prevention regime called PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis). The PROUD study, conducted over two years, became a world-leading investigation, with its conclusions used internationally as evidence of the medical efficacy of providing the drug to those most likely to contract HIV. It found that PrEP reduces the risk of transmission by 86%, and that those who take the drug are no more likely to contract other sexually transmitted infections. Some of those selected for the study are in relationships with HIV-positive people, some had volunteered after at least one unprotected sexual encounter within a three-month period, and others had been identified by clinicians as very likely to acquire the virus. But NHS England confirmed in May that it would not be rolling out PrEP to all those most liable to become infected, claiming that funding the drug was the responsibility of local authorities. Instead it said it would fund a small 2 million project offering the drug to a few hundred people. The Terence Higgins Trust, Britains largest HIV charity, told BuzzFeed News that there was no clarity on whether any of the PROUD participants would be included in that group. Dr Michael Brady, the trusts medical director, said: In reality, whatever they [NHS England] do its not going to happen for a few months, so were looking at months where everyone is having to get it privately or get generics. He added: The delays, and the real life impact of people on the PROUD study, just further highlights what feels like procrastination and a lack of clarity in [NHS Englands] statements. Brady said doctors were aware what the refusal to commit to further treatment meant. The PROUD study showed that nearly 10% of those in the at-risk group will contract HIV within the first year without the drug. So, he said, the decision not to provide the study participants with continued medication would lead many to become infected, as well as highlight the wider risk of withholding the drug from everyone vulnerable to infection. Not providing access to PrEP for all those MSM [men who have sex with men] who are like the PROUD participants is potentially allowing 10% to become infected, he said. We know that there are many more MSM at a similar risk who are not in the PROUD study. Now the study participants are on their last few pills with their doctors telling them they will not receive any more in the near future. One, Jamsheed Master, a 37-year-old musician from Brighton, told BuzzFeed News that he discovered at his recent appointment at the sexual health clinic that there would be no further prescriptions. I went on Monday kind of expecting that theyd have made some sort of provision to provide it and the answer was no, sorry, thank you very much, thats the end of the study. View this image  Jamsheed Master Jamsheed Master He said he felt the NHS had failed him and the participants. Its rough, he said, adding that earlier this year, We were told [by doctors conducting the study] Dont worry about it at the end of the study, more likely than not, the NHS will provide it. In March, when NHS England first announced that it would not make the drug universally available to those in need, it released a statement interpreted by many as indication that participants would be given PrEP after the study. It said: NHS England is keen to explore how a period of further support can be offered to the participants enrolled in the PROUD study and is committed to making funding available where there is a clinical need for additional help. Although participants were told that there were no guarantees that treatment would continue, Master said many participants were angry now because, after volunteering for a vital study that both helped the NHS understand the benefits of the drug and also transformed many of their lives, they had expected it to continue. The drug has absolutely changed my life, he said. Without a doubt, if I hadnt been on Truvada in the last two years I most likely will have contracted HIV in that time. I reckon its a 95-100% chance Id have got HIV. Beyond removing the chance of acquiring the virus, the effect of the drug was profound on a psychological level, said Master. It took the fear out of having sex. Its incredibly emancipating. He explained that for his generation of gay men who grew up in the midst of the AIDS crisis before effective medication arrived 20 years ago the fear of sex, and of HIV, can have severe effects on sex and relationships. View this image  Jamsheed Master Jamsheed Master Now, Master feels that he has no other option but to buy the drug privately, online, from a foreign manufacturer that makes cheaper versions, called generics, of the branded medication. This costs around 45 per month without postage. While I can afford to buy generically from the internet, theres many people who cannot, he said. And that makes me very cross especially in a country thats supposed to have social healthcare. We live in the UK and the NHS has a duty to provide it, in the same way it has a duty to provide contraception. He added that providing the drug would save the NHS money in the long run as providing this prevention drug is significantly cheaper than treating someone for HIV. Last month, Britains leading HIV epidemiologist, Professor Sheena McCormack, who ran the PROUD study, wrote to Simon Stevens, the CEO of NHS England, to ask whether the participants would continue to be given PrEP. Stevens deputy national medical director, Dr Jonathan Fielden, replied without confirming either way. PROUD.mrc.ac.uk PROUD.mrc.ac.uk He wrote: As part of the overall considerations for the test sites will be consideration of any ongoing needs of PROUD participants. We have already held initial discussions with [Truvada manufacturer] Gilead on this matter. Furthermore, we will continue to work with you and Public Health England to explore all avenues for how PrEP might be made available in the most clinically and cost effective way. Next week, following legal action by the National Aids Trust, the high court will conclude its judicial review on whether NHS Englands decision not to provide PrEP is justified. Master, meanwhile, made a direct plea to NHS England to at least protect those who volunteered for the study. Theres a product available that is a fraction of the price of [HIV] treatment, so you should be funding prevention with the same intensity that you fund treatment, he said. Theres an opportunity to end HIV, so why dont you take it? BuzzFeed News asked NHS England for comment on its decision not to provide the drug to PROUD participants but did not receive a response by time of publication.

aS"Your anus does not have a sexual orientation. Welcome to BuzzFeed Sex Q&A, where you can ask us your awkward, confusing, gross, embarrassing, or thought-provoking questions, and well provide answers from leading sexual health experts. Have a question about sex or sexual health? Send it to sexQs@buzzfeed.com. View this image  Hi to whoever may read this. Ill identify as a straight male, mid-twenties. As of late, Ive been curious about the male G-spot (butt play), and I got into wearing male thongs. So my questions are: 1) Does this make me gay?; and 2) How does one stimulate the G-spot? Ive been reading about butt plugs and anal vibrators, but do you have any recommendations for them, or how to start? Thanks,  Anonymous View this image  To answer it, we spoke with sex therapists Joe Kort, PhD, author of Is My Husband Gay, Straight, or Bi?, and Ian Kerner, PhD, founder of GoodInBed.com. Heres what they had to say: View this image  There is no rule or checklist out there that determines your sexual orientation by tallying up your turn-ons, your favorite sex acts, or your underwear preferences. Its about who youre sexually attracted to and how you identify, says Kort, not what youre sexually attracted to. Your anus doesnt have a sexual orientation; it just likes pleasure, says Kort. There are also lots of gay men who dont like anal sex. That doesnt make them any less gay. View this image  In no way does having your prostate stimulated have anything to do with your sexual orientation, says Kerner. All men regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity have prostates. Ditto for wearing a thong. Whatever underwear is comfortable for you and makes you feel confident and/or turned on throughout the day wear it! Clothing also does not dictate your sexual orientation. View this image  The prostate is a walnut-sized gland thats located right in front of the rectum, and it produces seminal fluid to nourish and protect sperm. Stimulating the prostate either alone or in combination with penile stimulation can really enhance and amplify orgasms, says Kerner. Men who get comfortable with prostate stimulation are usually really strong converts, he says. View this image  Just like you probably got really good at masturbating before you had sex with someone else, Kerner suggests getting comfortable with this new sensation before trying it with a partner. Kort also suggests doing some research and reading to learn more about it first (he suggests Anal Pleasure and Health by Jack Morin, PhD). To start, youll probably just want to explore the area with your fingers. So wash your hands, trim your fingernails, and get some lube. Then, when youre masturbating, first focus on the perineum (the area between the anus and the scrotum, aka your butt and your balls). Then focus on the anus, then the anal entrance, and finally (when lubed up), you can insert a finger into the rectum. Once youre comfortable with that sensation, you can try to stimulate your prostate by reaching up and back with your finger(s), explains Kerner, almost like youre trying to reach your belly button. View this image  The sheer number (and popularity) of sex toys specifically designed for anal pleasure should help to reassure you that this is a thing lots of people of all sexual orientations are into. Kerner suggests starting with a thin, silicone butt plug, like this one from Aneros. You can also try a prostate massager, like this stainless-steel pure wand from njoy. There are also some vibrating options from Lelo, like the Loki Wave, which actually makes a come here motion when you turn it on. There are obviously lots of different options, so spend some time looking around and reading reviews if youre not sure what you want. And be prepared to spend a little more for a really good-quality toy. As Kerner says, Theyre a little more expensive, but hey, youre putting this up your butt. View this image  So much lube. The rectum doesnt lubricate on its own, so youre going to need some help to make it really comfortable and pleasurable. Just make sure to use only water-based lubes with silicone sex toys, says Kerner, since a silicone lube will cause them to break down. View this image  I like that theyre writing in about this, because who else do you go to to talk about this? says Kort. Of course, if youre having more questions about your sexuality or youre having trouble accepting your sexual interests, it could be worth finding a sex-positive therapist to talk to.

aS"Sexual orientation discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, and bisexual people can only come from the Supreme Court or Congress, the federal appeals court in Chicago rules. View this image  People celebrate at the annual Chicago Pride Parade on Sunday, June 28, 2015. Nam Y. Huh / AP WASHINGTON A federal appeals court on Thursday rejected a womans claim that existing civil rights law protects against sexual orientation discrimination ruling that only the Supreme Court or Congress can make that the law. Kimberly Hively has failed to state a claim under Title VII [of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for sex discrimination, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals held in its decision in Hivelys appeals. [H]er claim is solely for sexual orientation discrimination which is beyond the scope of the statute. In ruling against Hivelys claim that sexual orientation discrimination should be barred under Title VII as a type of sex discrimination the court, primarily, pointed to a series of rulings from the appeals court beginning in 1984 and continuing through 2000 in which the court found that anti-LGBT discrimination was not covered by Title VII. A clearly conflicted Judge Ilana Rovner, joined by Judge William Bauer, went on for more than 40 pages, however, detailing what Rovner described as a paradoxical legal landscape in which a person can be married on Saturday and then fired on Monday for just that act. Addressing the Equal Employment Opportunity Commissions 2015 decision backing up Hivelys position that sexual orientation discrimination is a type of sex discrimination barred under Title VII, Rovner wrote, The idea that the line between gender nonconformity and sexual orientation claims is arbitrary and unhelpful has been smoldering for some time, but the EEOCs decision threw fuel on the flames. In the wake of the EEOCs decision, Rovner acknowledged that the district courtsthe laboratories on which the Supreme Court relies to work through cuttingedge legal problemsare beginning to ask whether the sexual orientationdenying emperor of Title VII has no clothes. She even acknowledged the fundamental correctness of the EEOCs logic: It seems illogical to entertain gender nonconformity claims under Title VII where the nonconformity involves style of dress or manner of speaking, but not when the gender nonconformity involves the sine qua non of gender stereotypeswith whom a person engages in sexual relationships. And we can see no rational reason to entertain sex discrimination claims for those who defy gender norms by looking or acting stereotypically gay or lesbian (even if they are not), but not for those who are openly gay but otherwise comply with gender norms. Nonetheless, Rovner concluded that the 7th Circuit should extend its prior decisions unanimously concluding that sexual orientation discrimination is not barred under Title VII, given that Congress has repeatedly rejected legislation to expand protections to include sexual orientation discrimination explicitly and the Supreme Court has declined to address the issue. Perhaps the writing is on the wall, Rovner wrote of a change, but concluding, Until the writing comes in the form of a Supreme Court opinion or new legislation, we must adhere to the writing of our prior precedent. Judge Kenneth Ripple joined in the portion of Rovners decision holding that Title VII does not include sexual orientation protections, but not the extended discussion on the EEOC ruling and emerging law on the viability of drawing a distinction between sex discrimination claims and sexual orientation discrimination claims.

Is that the tranny they are talking about it? Christine sent me that on email. While not all transgender people reject the term tranny, it is not a respectful term for people outside the community to use. Transvestite is an outdated term for men who dress as women for entertainment or pleasure. It is not the same thing as being a transgender woman. Do not use the word transvestite at all, unless someone specifically self-identifies that way, reads the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation media guide. The guide describes tranny as a word that dehumanises transgender people, and should not be used in mainstream media. I'm very sorry Chloe.

aS"We dont even know who the senators will be. View this image  Stefan Postles / Getty Images The government has said it will carry on with plans to hold a national vote on marriage equality but must pass enabling legislation through the parliament first. Speaking on the ABCs 7.30 program, Turnbull said that legislation would be brought forward this year. As to when it passes the parliament, obviously that will be a matter for the parliament, he said. Turnbull said he would like the plebiscite to be held as soon as practicable, but conceded it may not happen in the final half of this year, as he had signalled prior to the election. Look, if it is not held in the latter half of this year and recognising that parliament will be sitting for the first time on August 30, then it would be held early next year, he said. But we have to obtain the support of the senate. We dont even know who the senators will be at this stage. View this image  David Mcnew / Getty Images The plebiscite legislation should have no problems passing the house of representatives, given the Coalitions slim majority. However, Labors projected 27 senators, plus the Greens nine and Xenophons three, gives them a total of 39 one more than the 38 required to block legislation in the senate. When he was pressed prior to the election about whether Labor would wave through a plebiscite in opposition, Bill Shorten said Why should I have to accept and sign up to Malcolm Turnbulls grubby deal with the right wing of his party? Im not going to. However, he stopped short of saying his party would block the legislation, as did Greens leader Richard Di Natale. The Australian Christian Lobby, expected to be one of the leading groups in the no campaign, has said that if the plebiscite does not go ahead, that should put same-sex marriage off the table in the next term of parliament.

aS"There was a push at the Democratic Platform Committee this month to explicitly represent queer people. View this image  Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, co-chair of the Democratic Partys platform committee. AP / Matt Rourke Before Donald Trump stunned TV viewers last week by not only mentioning LGBT people in his Republican nomination acceptance speech, but adding a carefully enunciated Q representing queer people some Democrats were fighting to include that letter in their own partys platform.One of Qs loudest advocates was David Braun, a platform committee member from Oakland, California, who told BuzzFeed News that he made a case at the committee meeting this month in Orlando, Florida.I stepped to the mic at one point and said it was absolutely preposterous that we dont have the Q, he said, Everybody clapped, and they said we will get that done one way or another.The committee co-chair, Gov. Dannel Malloy of Connecticut, indicated the Q could be added at some point in the future as a procedural fix, according to Braun and another committee member, Mara Keisling. I think there was supposed to be a post-meeting conversation about it, and I think that never happened, Keisling, a transgender woman, told BuzzFeed News. She said Malloy suggested that the conversation would be best handled behind the scenes due to time constraints. It seems like we as a platform committee may have forgotten to get back to it. I certainly would have welcomed that conversation, Keisling added, noting the platform is the most progressive on LGBT issues in party history. She did not think leaving out the Q should be interpreted as discomfort with queer people. But Braun is upset.We submitted countless emails calling attention to it, he said, adding that other platform members brought it up several times at the committee meeting on July 9 and 10.The idea that we can self-identify and name ourselves is very important, said Braun, who identifies as gay. It is very unfortunate that queer people have to fight to be identified properly by a party that is supposedly paying lip service to our community.Within hours of the party platform being formally adopted Monday night, Oregon House Speaker Tina Kotek invoked the Q when she called for justice for the LGBTQ community and warning that LGBTQ rights are under attack.The week before, Trump deployed the letter when he pledged to do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.Both Gov. Malloys office and the Democratic National Committee referred questions about why the Q wasnt included in the platform to a spokesperson at the Democratic National Convention, who did not respond to emails from BuzzFeed News.

aS"A brief to be filed Wednesday offers a counterpoint to two groups of states that have sued the Obama administration in an effort to block federal protections for transgender workers and students. View this image  Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File A federal judge should not halt enforcement of Obama administration policies that advance protections for transgender students and workers under existing civil rights laws, according to a dozen states that will file a brief in federal court on Wednesday. The bottom line is that the federal guidance at issue here threatens no imminent harm, reads a draft of the brief provided to BuzzFeed News. The filing is led by Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson, whose brief adds that federal protections for transgender people are strongly in the public interest. Ferguson elaborated on getting involved in the litigation in an interview with BuzzFeed News, explaining, I think this case could go all the way to the Supreme Court, and I want to make sure the trial court has our perspective and the perspective of like-minded states. In May, officials in Texas and 10 other states sued the federal government over its interpretation of civil rights laws, taking particular offense with guidelines issued by the Department of Education that instruct schools to let transgender students use bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity. The states followed up in June by asking the court to issue an injunction that suspends the federal regulations, arguing that they unfairly burden states and jeopardize safety. Several weeks after Texas filed its lawsuit, another group of states, led by Nebraska, filed a similar lawsuit. But in the amicus brief to be filed Wednesday in the Northern District of Texas, the 12 other states led by Washington most of which have their own policies that ban discrimination on the basis of gender identity will argue no such problems result from protecting transgender people. Instead, the brief says, such polices protect transgender individuals from high rates of discrimination and violence. Contrary to Plaintiffs claims, our shared experience demonstrates that protecting the civil rights of our transgender friends, relatives, classmates, and colleagues creates no public safety threat and imposes no meaningful financial burden, says the brief. Washington State will be joined joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington, DC. Speaking to claims made by Texas and other states in the original lawsuit, the brief to be filed Wednesday will say that their allegations of safety risks are unsupported hyperbole, their claimed loss of federal funding is distant and avoidable, and their claims of massive renovation costs lack support in the law and the record. As such, the brief argues, Texas has not met the standards required for an injunction. Anyone whose civil rights are threatened need to have attorneys general standing up for them, Ferguson said in discussing the reason he led this effort. Right now, there is a lot of focus on transgender individuals, and it makes it all the more important to stand up for their civil rights. Tomorrow it may be someone else. For several years, the Obama administration has asserted that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 which ban discrimination on the basis of sex ban gender identity discrimination, or anti-transgender discrimination, as a form of sex discrimination. On May 13, the Education Department issued guidance instructing publicly funded education institutions to allow transgender students use facilities consistent with their gender identity in a wide range of settings, such as restrooms, dorms, and sports venues. Likewise, in recent years, the Justice Department and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission have contended in legal proceedings that transgender discrimination is barred in workplaces.

aS"When I was in that room, I felt so ugly. View this image  Lyashik / Getty Images Karen Parker, a researcher at La Trobe University, booked a Brazilian wax at Brazilica, in Brunswick, as a birthday present to herself in October last year. However, when the waxer saw Parker had not had sex reassignment surgery, she immediately said it wasnt possible. She said Lets get started, I took the towel off, she looked at me in horror, Parker told BuzzFeed News. I felt really humiliated. Parker explained she had specified that she is transgender when making the booking, and nobody had indicated it would be a problem. Parker said the waxer then went to get the manager, who explained they did not have the training to wax male genitals. Its not on our menu, she said. In the same way we dont offer a manicure, a pedicure, or anything else. Were not trained, were not set up to do it.Locke said the issue was not about gender identity, and on the day Parker came in, she was offered a wax on anything else she wanted. I get asked all the time Do you do male Brazilians, how much? or whatever. There are plenty of places that do do it. View this image  Alex Guibord / NEWZULU We state the waxing we do on our menu and website and male Brazilians are amongst a range of services we dont offer, Locke wrote. It would have been negligent for your therapist to go ahead at your insistence and wax an area of the body we hadnt trained her in. We assumed when you emailed for your appointment that you were post op, Locke added. Locke asked Parker to come in for a wax on the house and a chat about the issue.Parker then discussed the issue with Transgender Victoria, who said it was a possible case of discrimination on the basis of gender identity, and advised her to take it to the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission. Parker did so, but Brazilica declined to participate in the voluntary dispute resolution process in January this year. Parker then turned to Legal Aid to pursue a deed settlement. After some communication back and forth, a draft was drawn up that involved $1000 awarded to Parker in damages, and the requirement for Brazilica to clarify on their website that they do not do Brazilians for pre-operative transgender women. I wasnt happy with that anyway, but that was the only thing we got them to consider, said Parker. Locke said she agreed to make a donation to an LGBT organisation for Parker, but felt altering the website would not be a positive thing. I dont know that I would want to look at a website that said We wax anorexics like its an issue, or We wax mentally ill, or We wax transgender, or we dont. Everybodys welcome. However, Locke told BuzzFeed News she was unaware the settlement had been withdrawn. I would rather deal with it directly, and Ive tried to, she said. To my knowledge, its still all on the table.Parker said she has sought a resolution because she believes nobody should be rejected from a service based on their gender identity. My body doesnt match up to their expectations as a female, she said. Ive had hormone replacement therapy, Ive feminised myself in various ways, but I havent had full surgery. I like to think Im an attractive person, but when I was in that room, I felt so ugly. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"It was a nonevent. It was perfectly natural. View this image  BuzzFeed News / Dominic Holden PHILADELPHIA Hundreds of men and women shared a big, busy all-gender restroom at the Democratic National Convention on Monday and were seemingly unfazed by the experience. It doesnt make me nervous at all, Lula Dualeh, a delegate for Bernie Sanders, told BuzzFeed News. I just need to use the restroom. I dont care whos next to me. But restrooms have been a hot-button issue for many Republicans. State and federal politicians have politicized bathroom access, saying that allowing transgender women whom they call men to use the womens restroom poses a safety threat. At the Wells Fargo Center, which also had single-sex restrooms, a sign at the entrance of the all-gender restroom featured a figurine in a dress and another figurine without a dress. Inside, everyone took turns using stalls; then women and men washed their hands side-by-side at a bank of sinks. Nobody who spoke to BuzzFeed News found the situation troubling. A co-ed pack of conventioneers were searching for a bathroom one restroom for the guys and another for the women when one of the guys saw the sign and said, Its an all-gender restroom. Lets go. The group emerged a couple minutes later. Did they have any qualms about sharing a bathroom with each other at the same time? It was a nonevent, one woman said. It was perfectly natural. Republican leaders in North Carolina passed a law this year barring transgender people from restrooms that match their gender identity in government facilities, saying transgender women posed a threat to women and girls in restrooms. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz made segregating restrooms on the basis of birth sex a campaign talking point when he ran for president this year. He appeared to argue that transgender people should be restricted to using the bathroom at home. If a man to wants to dress as a woman, and live as a woman, and have a bathroom at home, he told reporters in April. You dont have a right to intrude upon the rights of others. However, So Young Yoon, a delegate, told BuzzFeed News that men in the restroom didnt feel like an intrusion at the convention her only concern was someone moving too slowly. I was just in a hurry, she said as she rushed back to the convention floor. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!  Tagged:dnc convention2016, dnc 2016, restroom, transgender by Katie J.M.

aS"My partner doesnt want his body. But I do. View this image  Ping Zhu for BuzzFeed News What did I learn from falling in love with a trans person? That spark plugs are on sale this week at Fleet Farm. How to feed a chicken. How to drive a trailer. The secret to making the best mojito youve ever had. We met in Iowa, at graduate school. He kept his horse, who didnt have a name, on a farm just out of town, along with the RV he slept in. He invited me to learn to ride and I went because I was claustrophobic and I breathe easiest when Im a little scared. He made me ride bareback so that Id learn to feel the horses movements through my legs. Hed jog beside me down the highway, the sun setting neon behind us, and the neighbors dog followed along, casting a thin shadow on the road. Later, weeks later, he climbed onto the horse behind me, his hands like feathers on the creases of my hips. Later, months later, we went walking in the Wisconsin Northwoods, near the cabin he had built with logs he skidded from the forest with a team of draft horses. I bushwhacked ahead and he followed, tracking my spoor in the first fall snow. He came to a log I had balanced on maybe 10 minutes earlier, and directly over each of my footprints was the careful print of a cougar. He didnt tell me about the cougar until were inside again, and I lay back on the couch beside him. He touched my collarbone with one finger. He touched the whole length of me before we kissed. I love you, I told him. This was in January, in the middle of the night. He lifted his head from my stomach. God help us, he said. Being trans is about gender, but loving a trans person is about sex. From the outside, at least. It must be a fetish, or I must be secretly bi, or at the very least Im sacrificing, just a little. A very female thing, the pity of love. My partner doesnt want his body. But I do. I wondered, at first what it meant about me, my sexuality. I adore men. Their shoulders, their chests, their thick arms. Deep voices and the prick of stubble against my neck, someone who can wrap me up and protect me from the world. That was how I knew I liked him: I couldnt help but watch as he worked with his horse. I watched his small hands, his strong forearms, his jeans tight around the muscles in his thighs. I watched him break the neighbors gelding, his limbs lithe as the animal reared and bucked beneath him, his face calm in a way Id rarely seen it. I never had a thing for cowboys until I met my own. As the weeks passed, as my skin burned at his touch, I decided I didnt need to understand. I didnt want to be another woman who interrogated her sexuality as soon as his lips touched hers. I didnt want to be another anything. Theres solidarity and fear in a town with no privacy. People have to work together, have to spend their lives together. They catch each others horses and borrow each others tractors. When I moved into my partners farmhouse, some of our neighbors muttered slurs at me from barstools, or pulled me aside to explain why we werent welcome in their homes. Apologetic, as if they wanted me to reassure them that it was ok. My partner doesnt care much; hes used to it, and hes got kind, brilliant friends who make me proud to live here. He just likes to keep track of whos saying things behind his back. I care, though. I want to smash their stupid mouths. Thats been one of the hardest things for me: not to defend him when he doesnt want defending. Im chatty early in the morning and hes chatty late at night. He reads random pages of Wikipedia, anything to quiet his mind. Lately hes been reading about pilots. He likes to read interesting sentences aloud and I throw my pillow to shut him up. I dont like any noise before sleep. I prefer to read until my eyes close, something mindless. Lately Ive been reading about makeup, even though I dont wear much. Its relaxing to me that people can control how theyre seen. Each morning he wakes up around 2 a.m., tiptoes to the couch, opens his laptop, and reads Wikipedia again until he falls back asleep. Each morning I find him there, wrapped in too many hand-crocheted blankets. His chin to his chest. Hes disheveled and hopeful and I love him so much like that, his hair flat to his forehead, his eyes puffy and soft. While his gluten-free bagel toasts, I put my cheek on his chest, careful not to tickle his nose with my hair. He smells most like himself in the morning. How do you apply for a job when your references refer to you as she? How do you correct them, again and again, without making them feel resentful? Theyre proud when they report that they only tripped up once, they corrected themselves, theyre sure the interviewer understands. Do you really think youll get that job? Some people trip up on purpose to prove that they havent been fooled. That theyre too smart for that. My partners name is Quince. I didnt want to have to tell you. I wanted to hold out, just use pronouns make a subtle point about, I dont know, how insignificant names are, how malleable. Youd know him better from watching him ride than from learning his name; and when his name changed, it doesnt mean that he did. But I need names in a way he doesnt, and am anxious about avoiding them. After just a few weeks, I named the horse Untitled. Thieves stole Untitled and took him to Oklahoma. We know exactly who they are, a girlfriend and boyfriend with a baby on the way. Ive found their pictures on Facebook. They named him Lucky and he lives on a ranch. Quince didnt want to call the cops. He thought that if he could talk to the thieves directly, maybe he could reason with them. He had trained Untitled himself and rode him across the Dakotas the summer before coming to Iowa, and hed promised Untitleds former owner that hed take good care of him. That promise was serious. Maybe he could explain that to the thieves. Maybe he was afraid to get an institution involved. He went looking for Untitled himself the next summer. Bought a trailer, drove to Oklahoma, tracked down the ranch after days of looking, found Untitled in a field. Climbed onto that bare back and started riding away, until he decided to stop and tell the thieves where he was going. He didnt want them to think the horse was just missing. He wanted them to know a wrong had been righted. It seems a lot of things dont work out the way he wants them to. He hadnt even dismounted before boyfriend thief had a rifle pointed at his neck. When Quince tried to explain, to show that he had Untitleds papers, boyfriend thief began to beat him with the rifle, swinging wildly in the air. Quince just sat there, high on Untitleds back, waiting for the anger to pass. Calm. But his calmness made everything worse. Furious at his lack of reaction, boyfriend thief reached up, grabbed Quinces thumb, and snapped the bone in his fist. And the whole time, Quince told me later, Untitled just stood there. He was so good. It made me want him back more than ever. Then the sheriff showed up, warned Quince for trespassing, and told him not to come back. We never saw Lucky again. Youre so brave, people tell him. Does he have apenis? those same people ask me, after their second beer. He proposed to me in an outhouse. Very traditional, down on one knee. The outhouse, Ill mention, had not been used for decades; an artist had turned it into an oracle, tucked into the edge of an open woods at the end of a dirt road. People could ask a question and pick an answer from a basket. Before I got there, Quince had replaced the answers with answers of his own, ones appropriate to the sentiment of the occasion. Joy is not a drowning substance. Let it soak you. I went into the oracle alone. I asked a secret question and pulled my answer: You only have to let the soft animal of your body love what it loves. And another note, hidden under what was once the toilet seat, with a ring tied to a twig: Also, you and Quince should spend your lives together, loving one another every day. [This note is only for Blair, from the Oracle.] He came in behind me and kneeled on the wooden floor. It was a tight fit for both of us. It was dusk and the mosquitoes were out. I didnt want the oracle to propose on Quinces behalf. I told him to ask me again, directly this time, before I said yes. They used to hang horse thieves, said everyone except the sheriff. Our favorite trip was to the Wisconsin Dells, a cheesy tourist town filled with water parks and gift shops. For three days we rode water slides and drank colorful drinks and played games in a flashing arcade. We went to a timeshare presentation, sitting in an audience of middle-aged couples while a man in a golf shirt urged us to make quality time for our families. He told too-loud jokes and maintained excellent eye contact. We loved it. The normalcy was thrilling; we basked for an hour in the fantasy of suburban coupledom, a life of sales scams and vacation clubs. When the group dispersed to meet with sales reps, we were both looking forward to the hard sell and the tour of a two-bedroom retreat facility. But when our sales rep got us alone, he gave a closed-mouth smile. Look, he said, I know you guys arent gonna buy this. Just, if anyone asks, tell them I gave you the pitch. I waited for the trick, for him to reveal a special option just for us. But he only led us to the door and out into the parking lot, where our station wagon baked in the sun. You can tell when someone has googled his name, at least in the artist scene. Theyll act one way for weeks, and then suddenly theyre too nice: They let him finish what hes saying. Maybe they post something pro-trans on Facebook. If you didnt know his gender history, youd think hes younger, arrogant, just a little too smart. He takes risks, cracks jokes that make people uncomfortable. Hes always pushing. Theres a logic under everything he says, an idea, but unless you pay close attention, youll miss it. Its always sad, the day someone stops treating him like hes an asshole. The state of Illinois wont release Quinces female birth certificate, so were not sure, when we get married, how well look on paper. When gay marriage passed, trans marriage did, too. I know that things will get easier that, one of these years, Quince will be more accepted. Im positive. When we want it bad enough, it will happen. Because when we need to, well disappear. Like so many others, well move, change our names. Its his choice, but if he chooses it, Ill go with him. Someday when were tired, or when we see the chance. Leave our small town for any other town, and when we get there, well just be ourselves, our current selves, and there will be no more slurs, no more intrusive questions, nothing left to hide. Well plant a garden, go to the grocery store, raise some more chickens. Maybe well get another horse. Maybe Ill take a dance class. Maybe hell find some hunting buddies. Well invite the neighbors over for mojitos and walk our dogs in the park and go to garage sales on the weekends, and well either have kids or we wont, and well make friends we love, and our friends will love us, and well be known, for once, for who we are.

aS"A final draft of the platform, created by hundreds of delegates, expands on an earlier version put together by party and campaign appointees. View this image  AP / Matt Rourke PHILADELPHIA When the Democratic Party released an initial draft of its platform, a document that was composed this spring by a handful of presidential campaign and party appointees, LGBT people were mentioned 11 times. But by the time a full platform committee which had hundreds of people, including LGBT policy wonks finished a final draft this month, LGBT people were mentioned more than twice as much, carving out the partys boldest stance on LGBT rights to date. On Monday, Democratic delegates are poised to formally adopt those planks with the full Democratic platform, charting a national agenda that ranges from expanding the legal interpretation of civil rights laws so that they protect LGBT people to defending their access to public spaces a nod toward blocking anti-transgender bathroom regulations promoted by Republicans. This is certainly the most progressive LGBT platform in the partys history and the most progressive platform overall, Mara Keisling, a member of the platform committee who helped advance several LGBT amendments, told BuzzFeed News in an interview. Keisling is also the executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality but spoke in her personal capacity. But the initial draft omitted LGBT issues that look like blind spots in the context of major current debates and policies advanced by the Obama administration. Most notably, the first draft lacked mention of applying bans on sex discrimination which were established by civil rights laws to also ban discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation. While that matter may seem arcane, it has been among the handful of LGBT advances at the federal level while Democrats are outflanked in Congress. Federal agencies have aggressively advanced these views to protect transgender students and workers, including their access to restrooms and Hillary Clintons platform has pledged to build on that legal strategy. I saw the first draft of the platform, and I didnt think, This pisses me off, said Keisling. Instead, I looked at it and thought, This is how we can fix it. In May, the party announced a 15-member committee to draft the platform, allocating 75% of the committees seats to the presidential campaigns, awarding the seats proportionally based on Hillary Clintons and Bernie Sanders vote tallies. That draft committee produced a version on July 1 that espoused several major LGBT goals, including stanching anti-transgender violence and blocking anti-LGBT bills in state legislatures while working to pass a federal nondiscrimination law. Proposals to expand the platform the next week had only a few dissenters, said Keisling, who added, These were not controversial votes. Keisling said that numerous delegates, including San Francisco Mayor Edwin M. Lee, introduced amendments to expand the LGBT planks at a meeting on July 9 and 10 in Orlando, Florida. Among them was one addressing the civil rights law: Democrats will fight for the continued development of sex discrimination law to cover LGBT people, the final draft states. The final draft also adds language about equipping the Census Bureau to track data on LGBT people and other historically undercounted populations. Another plank notes that detention can be unacceptably dangerous for LGBT people in regards to immigration enforcement. Other new elements include reviewing records for soldiers discharged due to their sexual orientation, and, in foreign policy, considering LGBT rights as a matter of human rights. The Democratic Party, Hillary Clintons campaign, and Bernie Sanders campaign did not comment to BuzzFeed News about the final platform or elements not included in the first draft.

aS"336,602       VIEWS Exclusive: Dean Eastmond was told by the NHS that if he died his partner would not be allowed to use his frozen sperm sample to have a child because they were in a same-sex relationship. But now hes won an apology from the UK fertility authority and a clarification of the rules to prevent discrimination. View this image  SWNS A tube from the chemotherapy drip curls up Dean Eastmonds arm, under his T-shirt, and into his chest. He sits in the bright, colourful young persons cancer unit explaining what his illness means, his chances of surviving, and the choices taken away from him because of who he loves. His voice is soft; he smiles often small, nervous smiles as if trying to reassure others that everything is going to be OK. Every few seconds the drip makes a clicking sound. After diagnosing Eastmond with a rare bone cancer Ewings sarcoma doctors at Birminghams Queen Elizabeth Hospital told the 20-year-old student that the treatment is likely to cause infertility, and that therefore it would be wise for him to store a sample of his sperm. But when Eastmond went to the sperm bank, the staff told him something else: If he died and there is around a 50% likelihood of that his partner, Adam Packer, would not be allowed to access the sample, to use with a surrogate mother. They would never be able to have children. However, if Eastmonds partner had been a woman, he explains, she would have been able to use the sample, and give birth to his child. This legal loophole the discrimination was like an assault, a slap in the face at the worst point of his life, says Eastmond. But it sparked in him a determination to uncover the legal justification for this disparity: How could it be, with a raft of equality laws in place for years, that this area could have been left behind? In turn, Eastmonds mission set off a chain of events that would expose the confusion surrounding the rules governing fertility treatment after death, and the impact on not only lesbian and gay couples, but also single and married people. And it would, ultimately, force Britains governing body for fertility treatments to apologise to Eastmond and to issue a clarification on the equal rights of same-sex couples. Eastmond did all this while undergoing chemotherapy. When BuzzFeed News goes to see him in hospital he is pale and thin hes lost 5kg (nearly a stone) in the last two weeks. He sits awkwardly, cross-legged, leaning forward. His hair fell out a few days ago, suddenly, in huge clumps. Packer, his boyfriend, helped shave the rest off and as the story unfolds it becomes clear that he is entwined in everything. Eastmond says the fellow student, who is 21, already saved him long before the cancer diagnosis. Something else emerges as the story twists in a series of startling directions: Eastmond did not speak out for himself, but for other LGBT people. He is convinced he will survive. View this image  SWNS Adam was here an hour ago, says Eastmond, smiling. They met in April 2015. He slept on the ward last night with me. They put a bed next to my bed. It was the first day of the second round of chemo. During each round, four lots of drugs are pumped directly into a vein in Eastmonds chest; it lasts 97 hours. He has a couple of weeks to recover and then he returns. He will have to do this 14 times. It began with a pain in his ribs. In January we had a house party, says Eastmond, referring to the flat he shares with other students from Birmingham University. Everyone got really drunk and I woke up the next morning with the most excruciating pain in my side. He gestures to his ribs on the right. He thought perhaps he had just bashed it while drunk, but he didnt know and decided not to do anything. I thought, I wont make a fuss. And in a couple of days the pain went. But it returned the following month, and the month after. One night I was writhing on the floor in pain. It was absolutely dreadful. But I thought it would pass. By late May, he could no longer ignore it. In the space of two weeks I developed a massive lump, he says. When he finally walked into the local A&E department, the lump had grown to the size of a baked bean can. It was, he says, 8cm by 6cm. I could cup my hand around it. It felt like a broken rib, like something was pushing against the rib and forcing it to bend. But when the doctor in A&E saw the lump, it was clear that it was not a broken rib. Eastmond went for a scan. They told me I had a tumour, he says. I thought it would be benign, something they could take out. The hospital took a biopsy and 10 days later Eastmonds life changed. It was cancer. Eastmond Eastmond Dean Eastmond, before chemotherapy, with his boyfriend, Adam Packer. I was numb, he says. But those in the hospital with him were not. Seeing Adams face and my mum and dad was his voice fades to nothing. Adam had to go to the bathroom because he was feeling so sick. Ewings Sarcoma normally features malignant tumours in bones, but sometimes in soft tissue. It affects men and boys more than women and girls and is predominantly a cancer found in children and young people most commonly with a tumour in the pelvis, but rib tumours are not unusual. Only a couple of dozen cases are diagnosed each year in Britain. In line with current research into patients aged 15-19, Eastmond was told his survival chances are 56%. The causes are unknown. As soon as the diagnosis was given, says Eastmond, Life wasnt the life I had been living in the past couple of years. It was suddenly cancer cancer cancer cancer. Before the chemo began, Eastmond went to the sperm bank. He had barely considered having children before, he says, not only because he is still so young but also because he had grown up knowing he was gay and not imagining it was a possibility. But faced with the prospect of it being an impossibility, Eastmond arrived for the appointment at the sperm bank, where, he says, a member of staff started explaining the consent forms for storing such a sample, either for use later in life or, in the event of death or mental incapacity, for a partner using it. Currently, men and women in Eastmonds situation can bank either sperm or eggs, which could, if desired, later be accessed for surrogacy or re-insemination. I brought up in conversation because Im not one to shy away from it the fact that Im gay, and she lifted an eyebrow and said, Oh, this applies for straight people. he says. Being told that if I died a male partner would not be able to use it [the sperm sample] when a female partner could felt like another slap in the face, another systematic discrimination against you as a gay person. The fact that an LGBT family or family-to-be out there would be in that position and wouldnt be able to [have children in this way] is absolutely horrendous. Tristan Potter / SWNS for BuzzFeed Tristan Potter / SWNS for BuzzFeed Tristan Potter / SWNS for BuzzFeed After the appointment, having stored his sample, Eastmond contacted the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, the NHS body responsible for overseeing this area, and made a Freedom of Information request to access the policies behind this apparent discrepancy. The HFEA sent Eastmond details of the complex, lengthy rules governing sperm and egg storage (which he forwarded to BuzzFeed News), along with an email confirming that it is not possible to donate sperm to your male partner to create embryos. This is due to the fact that your partners sperm will not be used to create the embryos nor would he be directly undergoing the fertility treatment. The authority also advised Eastmond to seek legal advice. It sounds so hurtful for the partner involved not being able to have a baby, says Eastmond. It comes down to a question of choice, he says; a choice, it seems, removed from same-sex couples. One day when Im economically stable enough itd be amazing to have a child, he says, aware that now he will have to survive for that to happen. Although he would want his partner to have the option to use his sperm in the future, if he died, for Eastmond, it is the principle, and how that would affect other LGBT couples, that concerns him most. Im hoping this law will never apply to me, but to have that brick wall there, while the highway is open for straight people? The discrimination out there is rooted in everything, and if its rooted in healthcare its another stop sign that says, Youre different; youre not part of this system. There should be something there for same-sex couples that [enables them to] consent to the partner [using the sample]. LGBT people are just as entitled to a family as anyone else. Eastmond is only grateful he realised at this stage; for those who only learn this after their partner dies, it is unthinkable, he says. To imagine that youre planning to have a child with this person, losing them must be hard enough, but then to come across the ramifications of these laws must be so distressing. Eastmond Eastmond The week after the chemo began, as Eastmond began to digest the news about the sperm sample and adjust to a new world of treatment, he went to his parents house in Devon to rest. It was the worst period so far, he says, as his body struggled to cope with the toxic effects of the treatment. But then Packer arrived. Within three days I went from not doing anything to walking along the cliffs, says Eastmond. He used the last bit of money in his bank account just to come down and see me. When Eastmonds hair fell out, Packer shaved the remaining patches that Eastmond could not reach. What does he see in the mirror now? Someone I really wish I wasnt, he says. But someone Im not going to be forever. Several times, as Eastmond speaks of the difficulties facing him, he adds the same phrase at the end of a sentence: Its all temporary, isnt it? He says this when talking about the chemo, the grim side effects of it fatigue, infections, heartburn so bad he has to take liquid morphine, memory loss and about the surgery planned for later this year, which will likely remove at least one rib and possibly part of a lung. But so far the chemotherapy has had some visible effect the tumour that had been protruding through his side has shrunk so that there is at least no external sign of it. But there are other visible signs: the hair loss, the weight loss. Walking down the street and getting looks for looking like a cancer patient is Rather than finish the sentence, Eastmond adds, No one knows what to say. For people younger than him, CLIC Sargent, the cancer charity, has stepped in to help explain. They gave my little brother, whos 9, a book entitled, My brother has a tumour. When Eastmond learned he would not be able to consent to Packer using his sperm if he died, he made a vow. I thought, Im going to change this; Im not going to let this happen. And so, after writing to the HFEA, he contacted BuzzFeed News. The day after the interview, BuzzFeed News contacted both the Department of Health a spokesperson for whom said the HFEA was best placed to respond and the HFEA itself to ask why same-sex couples were unable to access their partners samples, and for the authority to provide some legal clarity on this. When a spokesman for the HFEA responded, he admitted that after investigating further, the authority realised that its advice to Eastmond had not been entirely correct, that Eastmonds case had triggered internal discussions about the rights involved for same-sex couples, in order that the authority was correctly interpreting the law. The same day, the HFEA emailed Eastmond. His case, said the email, led us to go back and review the response they originally gave him and after further discussions they could provide a more detailed and accurate response. The email continued that contrary to what we said in our original reply, you should be able to donate to your partner so that he can use your sperm. View this image  SWNS However, the email sets out the legal hoops through which he and Packer would need to jump to have even a hope of enabling Packer to use the sample in the event of Eastmonds death. It advises that Eastmond would need to seek legal advice in order to correctly word a statement of consent to accompany his sperm sample, explaining for whom and for what it could be used after his death. Even then, it continued, Your partner will not become the owner of your sperm on your death and he will not be able to say what may or may not happen with your sperm. This is something you must do, it is a legal requirement. Packer would also need legal advice in order to ensure that he would have parental rights, it explained. But even then, the HFEA explained, if Packer were single this might prove difficult in the event of using a surrogate mother, because if she is married, her rights to the child would trump Packers, therefore preventing him from becoming the legal father, as surrogacy laws favour couples over single people. BuzzFeed News asked the HFEA one further question, however: How does this differ if at all from what a heterosexual person would have to do? In a telephone call, a spokesman for the HFEA confirmed, finally, the single piece of clarification that Eastmond had sought all along for him and his partner, but principally for all same-sex couples facing their predicament. The HFEA, said the spokesman, is clear: A same-sex couple does not have to do anything differently to a heterosexual couple; there is, in the end, no distinction on the grounds of sexual orientation, or indeed gender. A person who might die can stipulate, with legal help, who can use their eggs or sperm. The discrimination exists at the point of surrogacy: A biological mothers rights cannot be extinguished by a single person: male, female, gay or straight. In the end, although it is technically feasible, practical difficulties remain, as conceded in the HFEAs email to Eastmond: It may indeed be possible for you to donate your sperm for use in someone elses treatment with your partner, but, as you see, doing so is not without considerable legal complexity. But for Eastmond, it is a victory: The principle of equality has been clarified and stated publicly. Still in hospital attached to his chemotherapy drip, he sent BuzzFeed News an email about this development: Its encouraging to know that there are legal ways around the system to help LGBT families. Its still upsetting to hear that the laws behind surrogacy and co-parenting are complicated, especially as cases similar to my own are already so stressful and exhausting in the first place. The HFEAs apology for originally providing differing information is no fault of their own and articulates how confusing fertility laws are for gay and bi men and women. Though Im not planning on having children for quite some while, its good to hear that theres help in place for people in similar situations. The same day, something else happened, and he sent another email explaining that his hospital might be sending him to the USA for proton beam therapy a different form of radiotherapy which, according to NHS England, uses a high energy beam of protons rather than high energy X-rays to deliver a dose of radiotherapy and works best on some very rare cancers and which can be a more effective form of therapy because it directs the all-important radiation treatment to precisely where it is needed with minimal damage to surrounding tissue. Itll really help me beat this, he wrote. Im hopefully one of the lucky ones and find out in two weeks! Eastmond has started blogging about his experiences of cancer. It keeps him going, he says, while hopefully helping others feel less alone. Although still facing at least a year more of treatment, after finding success in clarifying the rights of those in his situation, he wants to keep championing the rights of LGBT peoples healthcare more generally. Above all, he wants to focus on the future. I cant wait to graduate, he says. To continue my freelancing, to move to London and to be with Adam.

aS"The college sports association released a survey for for cities bidding to host games. View this image  AP / David J. Phillip Cities seeking to host college championship sporting events must demonstrate how they will protect attendees and participants from discrimination, particularly shielding them from laws that restrict transgender peoples access to restrooms, the National Collegiate Athletic Association announced Friday. All bidding cities must fill out a survey by August 12 asking whether the municipality has policies banning discrimination or, conversely, if it has regulations that interfere with any persons choice of bathroom or locker room. Cities that have already been granted championship rounds will also need to submit the survey on a separate deadline. The announcement comes a day after the NBA announced it was withdrawing its 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte in protest of anti-LGBT law passed by North Carolina lawmakers in March. The law bans transgender people from using restrooms that match their gender identity in government facilities. Greensboro, North Carolina is scheduled to host the second and third rounds of the 2017 Mens Division I Basketball Tournament, a.k.a. March Madness. An NCAA spokesperson said the new requirement applies to all championship rounds, not just the title game.Reached by phone Friday afternoon, Greensboro Convention & Visitors Bureau President & CEO Henri Fourrier told BuzzFeed News that his office has not yet had an opportunity to review the new NCAA mandate. Fourrier said the city of Greensboro intends to submit a number of bids for NCAA events in the near future. Asked about the maneuvering of navigating existing state law with the new NCAA mandate, Fourrier said: It concerns me.The NCAA has not made a determination about whether they will pursue a change of venue for the March Madness events in North Carolina.Indianapolis is scheduled to host two rounds of March Madness in 2017. In 2015, the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act was signed into Indiana law by Governor Mike Pence, the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumps pick for vice president.The states Religious Freedom Restoration Act was criticized for promoting discrimination against LGBT people. After an uproar, lawmakers passed a subsequent fix stating that religious freedom law, which remains on the books, could not be used to discriminate. Indiana lacks a law banning discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation. A question on the NCAA anti-discrimination survey reads: Does your city, county/parish and/or state have provisions that allow for refusal of accommodations or service to any person? When asked how a prospective NCAA host city in Indiana would answer that question, a spokesperson for Governor Pence said Youll have to ask the cities. Asked how Governor Pence would respond if the NCAA determined a city in Indiana ineligible to host an event due to a lack of anti-discrimination protections, the spokesperson said the Governors office doesnt speak to hypotheticals.In response to a question regarding whether or not the NCAA has been in contact with Governor Pences office about existing law and the new anti-discrimination mandate, the spokesperson responded: Its late on a Friday so Id have to check. Despite pressure to move the games this year, the NCAA hosted its Final Four games in Houston, Texas, which had repealed a nondiscrimination ordinance following a 2015 campaign that claimed transgender people posed a threat in restrooms. Fridays announcement results from the NCAA board voting in April on rules that bidding cities must demonstrate how they will provide an environment that is safe, healthy, and free of discrimination, the questionnaire says. The boards decision follows the recent actions of legislatures in several states, which have passed laws allowing residents to refuse to provide services to some people based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, the questionnaire goes on. While proponents of the laws focus on how they protect religious beliefs, critics have voiced concerns that they create an environment of sanctioned discrimination.

aS"Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal who is gay, did not call on the party to change its policy goals. View this image  AFP / Getty Images / Jim Watson Billionaire PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, one of the first openly gay speakers at a Republican convention, rebuked one of the partys goals Thursday night: banning transgender people from restrooms that match their gender identity.When I was a kid, the great debate was about how to defeat the Soviet Union, said Thiel, praising US technological innovations. And we won.Now we are told that the great debate is about who gets to use which bathroom, he continued. This is a distraction from our real problems.Who cares? he asked a cheering crowd. The Republican Partys 2016 platform opposes the rights of transgender students to use school facilities that match their gender identity, calling that an ideology alien to Americas history and traditions. Republicans in numerous state legislatures have advanced bills to ban transgender people from certain restrooms. A supporter of marriage equality, Thiel told the crowd, I am proud to be gay. I am proud to be a Republican. But most of all, I am proud to be an American. His pronouncement prompted delegates in the Quicken Loans Arena burst into a chant: USA! USA! USA! But Thiel who asked voters to support Donald Trump did not call on the Republican Party or Trump to reform their stance on LGBT issues. His running mate, Indiana Gov.

aS"The three-day event likely will move to New Orleans, a top NBA journalist writes View this image  Adam Silver, left, and Charlotte Hornets owner Michael Jordan, right, pose for a photo during a news conference to announce Charlotte, N.C., as the site of the 2017 NBA All-Star basketball game. The NBA has pulled the 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte after North Carolina lawmakers failed to repeal or repair an anti-LGBT law passed in spring. The All-Star Weekend events, scheduled to take place February 17-19, will likely be moved to New Orleans, according to top NBA reporter Adrian Wojnarowski at Yahoo Sports. Attention turned to the NBA and the All-Star Game shortly after North Carolina quickly passed HB2 in March. The law removes anti-discrimination protections for LGBT people in North Carolina, and has faced heavy backlash for provisions that would require transgender people to use bathrooms that coordinate with the gender they were assigned at birth. In a statement, the NBA said: Since March, when North Carolina enacted HB2 and the issue of legal protections for the LGBT community in Charlotte became prominent, the NBA and the Charlotte Hornets have been working diligently to foster constructive dialogue and try to effect positive change. We have been guided in these discussions by the long-standing core values of our league. These include not only diversity, inclusion, fairness and respect for others but also the willingness to listen and consider opposing points of view. Our week-long schedule of All-Star events and activities is intended to be a global celebration of basketball, our league, and the values for which we stand, and to bring together all members of the NBA community current and former players, league and team officials, business partners, and fans. While we recognize that the NBA cannot choose the law in every city, state, and country in which we do business, we do not believe we can successfully host our All-Star festivities in Charlotte in the climate created by HB2. Gov. Pat McCrory, a leading proponent of the law, issued a statement Thursday blasting the NBA and progressive organizations over the decision. The sports and entertainment elite, Attorney General Roy Cooper and the liberal media have for months misrepresented our laws and maligned the people of North Carolina simply because most people believe boys and girls should be able to use school bathrooms, locker rooms and showers without the opposite sex present, McCrory said. The governor continued: Twenty-one other states have joined North Carolina to challenge the federal overreach by the Obama administration mandating their bathroom policies in all businesses and schools instead of allowing accommodations for unique circumstances. Left-wing special interest groups have no moral authority to try and intimidate the large majority of American parents who agree in common-sense bathroom and shower privacy for our children. American families should be on notice that the selective corporate elite are imposing their political will on communities in which they do business, thus bypassing the democratic and legal process. In April, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said the league felt it would be more constructive to work with the state to modify the law than to revoke the All-Star Weekend festivities. The NBA reportedly worked with legislators to prepare a bill intended to walk back the impact of HB2. The proposal that emerged would have issued certificates to transgender people allowing them to use public bathrooms, but only if they registered their sex assignment surgery. The fix was widely criticized by LGBT and human rights groups. ACLU attorney Chase Strangio blasted the proposal, saying it would create a government repository of private medical information about transgender people. The NBA quickly distanced itself from the bill after four LGBT advocacy groups wrote to Commissioner Silver with concerns about the proposed legislation and the leagues reported involvement in its drafting. The NBA has been actively working behind closed doors to help hammer out another discriminatory bill that would exacerbate some of the worst provisions in the HB2 law targeting LGBTQ people, the groups wrote to Silver. If the NBA wants to be a champion for LGBTQ equality, then work with us to ensure full statewide protections for LGBTQ North Carolinians. But please do not cut a deal that would sell us out. The pressure apparently worked, as the NBA issued a statement on the walk back bill saying we do not endorse the version of the bill that we understand is currently before the legislature. In a statement Thursday regarding the decision to pull the All-Star Game from North Carolina, the league said: We are particularly mindful of the impact of this decision on our fans in North Carolina, who are among the most passionate in our league. It is also important to stress that the City of Charlotte and the Hornets organization have sought to provide an inclusive environment and that the Hornets will continue to ensure that all patrons including members of the LGBT community feel welcome while attending games and events in their arena. We look forward to re-starting plans for our All-Star festivities in Charlotte for 2019 provided there is an appropriate resolution to this matter. Michael Jordan and the Charlotte Hornets said: We understand the NBAs decision and the challenges around holding the NBA All-Star Game in Charlotte this season. There was an exhaustive effort from all parties to keep the event in Charlotte, and we are disappointed we were unable to do so. With that said, we are pleased that the NBA opened the door for CHarlotte to host All-Star Weekend again as soon as an opportunity was available in 2019. We want to thank the City of Charlotte and the business commmunity for their backing throughout this entire process, starting with the initial bid. We are confident that they will be just as supportive and enthusiastic for the 2019 NBA All-Star Game. On Friday, the National Basketball Players Association released a statement on the decision: The National Basketball Players Association supports the leagues decision to relocate the 2017 NBA All-Star Game from Charlotte. North Carolina is home to a sizable number of current and former NBPA members. They and our entire membership looked forward to participating in the All-Star week activities in the Charlotte community. However, the enactment of legislation that challenges the right of all Americans from discrimination threatened the ability of every attendee to enjoy the All-Star festivities. We join the NBA in the hope that the annual celebration of our game will one day, soon, be held in Charlotte. LGBT advocacy organization Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said the NBA and Commissioner Silver sent a clear message that they wont stand for discrimination against LGBTQ employees, players or fans with the decision to pull the All-Star Game from North Carolina. The NBA repeatedly warned state lawmakers that their hateful HB2 law created an inhospitable environment for their 2017 All-Star Game and other events. Nevertheless, Governor McCrory, Senator Berger and Speaker Moore doubled down on HB2 and refused to undo their discriminatory and costly error in judgment. Every day that HB2 remains on the books, people across North Carolina are at risk of real harm. We appreciate the leadership of the NBA in standing up for equality and call once again on lawmakers to repeal this vile HB2 law. Former NBA players Jason Collins, who was the first active out gay player in the four major mens leagues said: As a member of the NBA family and as a gay man, Im extremely proud to see the NBA take initiative and move the All Star Game from North Carolina. Their decision is an extremely poignant one and shows that discrimination of any kind is not welcome in sports and is not acceptable in any part of our society. The NBA has set the best kind of example and precedent moving forward for all to follow. ESPN, which broadcasts NBA games, but not the All-Star Games, said: ESPN has demonstrated a strong commitment to inclusion. The NBAs decision is one which we fully support, emphatically illustrating that the league clearly stands for inclusion as well. The NBPA has not issued a statement. The NBA All-Star Weekend was expected to have an economic impact of about $100 million, according to an estimate given to the Charlotte Observer by the Charlotte Regional Visitors Authority. 3.

aS"The students say the Daily Telegraph story is completely wrong, and has hurt their charity efforts. View this image  Cheltenham Prefects / Supplied On Wednesday, the Daily Telegraph claimed staff were banned from referring to Cheltenham students as girls, ladies, or women in order to include gender diverse and transgender students.However, such a directive was never given. Rather, the story was based on a presentation in a staff meeting about how to be inclusive of LGBT students. The school has not and will not change the way students gender is referred to, read a statement from the school posted on Facebook.NSW education minister Adrian Piccoli told 2UE radio the suggestion the school had banned the word girls was ridiculous and wrong. I spoke to the principal about this when we got asked about it, and the answer is no, thats not true, he said. It was another teacher at the school talking about inclusivity. View this image  Cheltenham Prefects / Supplied The titles on news websites are clickbait and completely misleading, she said. Girls are still being called girls.Kimberly said the schools prefect group had had to de-activate its Facebook page due to hateful comments from a member of the public, generated by the Daily Telegraph story. The group had been using the page to advertise their fundraising efforts for the Cure Brain Cancer Foundation, for which they raised over $5000. View this image  Cheltenham Prefects / Supplied BuzzFeed News understands that part of the presentation was focused on how to use respectful language towards gender diverse and transgender students.For the most part, the things discussed in the staff meeting would have little impact on the majority of students. However, it would have a profound positive impact on LGBT students within our school, Davison said. Davison added that there are plenty of extra-curricular groups at the school that cater to all kinds of interests, including social justice initiatives and religious groups. I have never heard of students being ostracised for not wanting to participate in events within the school, she said. Michelle Kezerle, a representative of the schools Queer Straight Alliance, told BuzzFeed News she felt supported by the school and appreciated teachers being advised on how to deal with gender diverse students. Im happy that people of other gender identities are now being catered for and no one is feeling put off about being misgendered, she said. Another member of the QSA told BuzzFeed News teachers learning about how to deal with transgender and gender diverse people was essential. A whole group of people whose identities were once being erased and disregarded are finally receiving the validation they deserve, they said. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Trumps pick for VP Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is known best for backing his states religious freedom law. View this image  AP / John Locher When Indiana Gov. Mike Pence accepts the vice-presidential nomination on Wednesday night, he will address a country that knows him best for promoting his states religious freedom law, a measure widely criticized for promoting LGBT discrimination. But it is unclear whether Pence, an evangelical Christian who is still a stranger to many voters, will actually address the issue at the Republican National Convention in an effort to woo social conservatives who supported the law but are wary of Donald Trump. (After backlash, Pence signed a fix bill.) The question is if they do something tonight to try bringing those religious voters on board, and if so, what they do and whether it will be effective, Liz Mair, a Republican strategist who has worked to oppose Trump, told BuzzFeed News in an interview Wednesday. Mair said that when it comes to religious liberty and LGBT protections, Trump obviously dances around this stuff a little, but Pence is not seen as dancing around it. Indeed, promoting Pences socially conservative agenda on a national stage could endear the presidential ticket to a sect of evangelicals who backed more pious candidates in the primaries, such as Ted Cruz and Ben Carson. As NPR reported Wednesday, the Trump campaign is relying on Pence to rally conservatives behind Trump. Because of [Pences] popularity within the grassroots of the Republican Party we feel that he helps accelerate the unification of the party in a really meaningful way, Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort told NPR. Yet Trumps most outspoken gay backer hopes Pence remains silent on domestic LGBT politics. Chris Barron, the head of Gays for Trump, believes Pence should pledge his allegiance to Trumps policy positions in broad strokes, telling BuzzFeed News that Trump is the most pro-gay friendly Republican nominee we have ever had. I dont need Mike Pence to rehash what played out in Indiana, he said, stressing that he wanted Pence to focus instead on radical Islam, whose stated goal is to exterminate LGBT people. Neither Trump nor Pence has been a supporter of LGBT rights, with Trump suggesting on the campaign trail that he would appoint Supreme Court justices who overturn marriage equality and offering mixed messages on other LGBT issues. But Pence has taken a harder line. As a congressman, he voted against a bill to ban discrimination on the basis for sexual orientation in employment. He also supported the Defense of Marriage Act, which blocked the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages in states where it was legal. Pence continued to oppose same-sex marriage after the Supreme Court struck down state bans nationally. More recently, he denounced the federal government expanding transgender protections in schools. Still, on Pences most scrutinized position Indianas religious freedom law his record could be a double-edged sword, warned Mair. Reacting to the backlash, Pence angered conservatives when he signed follow-up legislation to say the original law could not be used as a defense for discrimination. Conservatives who I talk to in the Never Trump movement have a soft spot for Pence, but the way he handled the religious liberty thing was not cool, said Mair. I think the mere presence of Pence on the ticket is enough to make them feel more comfortable, said Mair, referring to highly engaged evangelical voters. Speaking to Pences speech Wednesday, she said, If I were writing the speech, I would avoid the topic [of LGBT issues] because I dont think its obvious how that will play with everybody tuning in. She believes, in the end, Pence will be a wash with social conservatives. I think the story will be that Trump tried to do something to assuage religious voters by picking Pence, but ha, ha it didnt work. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Results announced at the International AIDS Conference this week aim to recreate the success of Timothy Brown, the only man in the world to be cured of AIDS. View this image  Timothy Brown T.J. Kirkpatrick / Getty Images In 2007, a man with AIDS in Germany began the first of two bone marrow transplants he desperately needed to treat a rare form of blood cancer that threatened to kill him. The procedures were risky his doctor needed to find an exact marrow match so that the donor cells would not destroy his own. But his doctor in Berlin decided to make this search even harder: He wanted to find a donor whose DNA might be protected from HIV. About a decade earlier, scientists had discovered a rare DNA mutation that prevented the HIV virus from infecting blood cells. The small group of people known to carry the mutation were naturally resistant to HIV, and the doctor thought that maybe, if his patients new bone marrow had the same mutation, then he could be free of AIDS, too. The man, initially known as the Berlin Patient, did get a transplant with the special mutation, and stopped taking his antiretroviral medications. In 2008, his doctors announced that, even without these drugs, he had no detectable levels of HIV. Now known to be a Seattle native named Timothy Brown, the man is still free of the virus today, and the only person ever to be cured of HIV. Over the past eight years, scientists have tried many ways to replicate what happened in Timothy Browns body. On Thursday at the massive International AIDS Conference in Durban, South Africa, a group of European researchers will report that they may have done so in two people with the disease. Since getting bone marrow transplants three years ago, these two patients have cleared HIV from their bodies (though they are also still taking antiretroviral drugs). Since its launch in 2012, the study, known as the EpiStem project, has given bone marrow transplants to 15 people with HIV and severe cancer (all of whom would have gotten the transplants anyway). Of those, nine died from complications related to the extremely risky procedure. Results on the three who have passed the three-year mark are being presented at the conference. Two of them carry no HIV in their blood, and the third has very low levels of the virus. We see a huge decrease of the viral reservoir, Annemarie Wensing, a clinical virologist at the University Medical Center Utrecht and one of the leaders of the EpiStem study, told BuzzFeed News. Thats not seen with any of the other cure strategies in clinical trials. But others are asking whether this approach is too dangerous to be used on the vast majority of people carrying HIV. They got lucky in terms of Timothy Brown he was able to survive not one but two transplants, and come out alive, Carl Dieffenbach, head of the Division of AIDS at the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told BuzzFeed News. You have to remember that purpose of a physician is to first do no harm, Dieffenbach added. I think where we are right now is, how can we take this and consider it as potentially going beyond people with these life threatening diseases? To find bone marrow transplant donors who carry the HIV-resistant mutation which affects a cell receptor known as CCR5 the researchers sequenced the DNA of more than 1,000,000 potential donors in Europe. Some of the patients received transplants with the mutation, and others did not. By comparing these two groups, the researchers wanted to see whether Browns cure was the result of the CCR5 mutation, or of simply getting infused with foreign cells. (Bone marrow transplants often come with graft-versus-host disease, which kills off the bodys native cells and, some speculate, could be involved in wiping out HIV.) The trials initial results are encouraging, Wensing said, though its still unclear whether the results are due to the CCR5-altered cells, the bone marrow transplant itself, or the standard antiretroviral medications. Of the three individuals who have made it three years since their transplants, two received normal bone marrow cells and one received the HIV-resistant type. One of the individuals who received the normal type cells luckily avoided graft-versus-host disease. The other two one of whom had HIV-resistant cells, and one of whom didnt did experience graft-versus-host. Both of these individuals now have undetectable levels of their own immune cells in their blood, but also have undetectable levels of HIV. The other patient has low levels of their own immune cells and HIV still detectable in their blood. It will take some work to determine how the various factors are at play, but Wensing says the worst is over since the three patients are healthy and cancer-free. The next step will be deciding whether the patients will go off their antiretroviral medications, to see whether the bone marrow transplants were solely responsible for eradicating their HIV. The researchers did not present any results from the other three patients in the trial, who got their transplants less than three years ago. View this image  A rhesus macaque monkey Ed Jones / AFP / Getty Images Meanwhile, on Sunday at the Durban conference, scientists from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle reported on another promising approach to replicating Timothy Browns success. The scientists took blood from monkeys infected with the monkey version of HIV (known as SHIV) and genetically engineered their stem cells to remove CCR5. They then infused the tweaked cells back into the animals, and took them off of their antiretroviral drugs. The idea is that this approach, if successful, would remove the often lethal threat of graft-versus-host disease. The biggest thing thats important about our approach is that were putting an animals own cells back into their bodies, Chris Peterson, a staff scientist at Fred Hutchinson and leader of the study, told BuzzFeed News. Now the question is, how well do they protect against infection? Their initial results showed that the genetically engineered blood cells preferentially grow when the virus is introduced into the monkeys presumably because the virus is killing off all of the non-engineered cells. The researchers also found that the tweaked cells spread everywhere not just in the blood and especially in hard-to-reach locations known to act as reservoirs for HIV, such as the gastrointestinal tract, the brain, and the lungs. Its still too early to tell, however, whether these engineered blood cells are actually curbing HIV levels in the animals. Other groups, including the California companies Sangamo Biosciences and Calimmune, are trying similar gene-editing approaches in people. As for Timothy Brown, the scientists leading the new studies say he is aware of their efforts at replicating his success. We have spoken to him, he was very happy with the program, Wensing said. I think its lonely to be the only patient cured. 3. Newly Approved HIV Therapy Will Genetically Modify Patients Stem Cells buzzfeed.com Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Its inevitable we will see an increase. View this image  Allan Clarke / BuzzFeed James Ward, Australias top Indigenous infectious disease expert, has predicted an increase in rates of sexually transmitted infections, hepatitis and HIV within the NSW Aboriginal community following funding cuts to sexual health prevention programs run by the Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council (AHMRC). Without more funding the AHMRC will have to stop running sexual health programs across the state and may have to fire several staff members after funding from the federal and state governments expired in June. Those jobs cuts come at the most vulnerable time for [the Indigenous] community. Weve got evidence of rates of sexually transmitted infections increasing, in particular in NSW. Weve also got our highest ever rates of HIV notifications occurring in our community and the potential for that to increase is at an all-time high, Ward told BuzzFeed News. View this image  James Ward. Allan Clarke / BuzzFeed The NSW ministry of health was given $2.3 million by the Commonwealth government in 2015 to fund a range of Aboriginal sexual health and blood borne virus programs in NSW through 15 Aboriginal community controlled health services and the AHMRC. Sandra Bailey, the AHMRC CEO, said in a statement she was under the impression that the NSW department of health would then fund the service, and claims she was only told two days before the federal funding expired on June 30 that there would be no new money. AHMRC signed a partnership agreement with the NSW government through the health portfolio, and the approach taken by the ministry of health in this matter undermines the sectors trust and confidence in the partnership, Bailey said. Given the weight of evidence and the on-paper commitment of state and federal governments to improving Aboriginal health, it is difficult to understand the rationale for withdrawal of this meagre investment. View this image  Allan Clarke / BuzzFeed In a statement to BuzzFeed News, the NSW department of health said that HIV prevention within the Aboriginal community was a top priority. NSW Health remains strongly committed to working with the Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services sector and will continue the investment of $225,000 to support transition arrangements for each of the of the affected Aboriginal Medical Services, the statement reads. View this embed  Last week, doctors in Cairns raised concerns over a spike in HIV cases among Indigenous community members, with nine new positive diagnoses this year alone. This happened in the same week that Australian medical experts said AIDS was no longer a public health issue. Ward, who led the Goanna study, an extensive report on Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander young people and their sexual health, points to Cairns as a grim glimpse of an unfolding crisis within the Indigenous community. While we are doing great efforts to get no new infections in non-Aboriginal people across Australia, our Aboriginal population is still the most vulnerable, because we are not accessing the services or medications as readily, Ward said. This is a real story of inequity, while its a great story of moving toward ending HIV is Australia, it is also a story of how a portion of the population, Aboriginal people, are more likely to have increasing rates of HIV.

aS"It was something we all really believed strongly in, and it was kind of nice to put your money where your mouth is, screenwriter Doug Jung told BuzzFeed News. View this image  Doug Jung in Star Trek Beyond. Paramount Pictures / Via youtube.com Making Lt. Hikaru Sulu (John Cho) gay in Star Trek Beyond the first clearly LGBT main character in Treks 50-year history recently became somewhat controversial after George Takei, who originated the role, called the decision really unfortunate. But when they were writing the script, Doug Jung and Simon Pegg were concerned about sparking a different kind of controversy around the character. We really were trying to make sure that no one thought it was something that happened that made him gay, Pegg told BuzzFeed News in mid-July. The screenwriters wanted to certify the characters sexuality as a fact and not some kind of Trek-ian anomaly, while also integrating him into the larger fabric of the Trek universe. So, they decided to give him a family. It felt like wed [said], like, Oh, heres Commodore Paris, shes the head of Yorktown and she also is a lesbian, it would have just felt a little bit like, Heres the [gay] character! Look, arent we clever! said Pegg. What Pegg and Jung did not realize at the time they were writing Sulus storyline was that the latter would have an even more integral role: Doug Jung wound up playing Sulus husband. It was very off the cuff, Jung told BuzzFeed News in mid-July. Director Justin Lin had planned to shoot the characters scenes in the gleaming, modern cityscape of Dubai, which stood in for Star Trek Beyonds vast space station Yorktown. Initially, the production wanted to hire a local actor for the role. It was one of those things that sounds like a minor thing, but it just ended up not being very easy, Jung said. An actor was eventually cast, but according to Jung, he dropped out the day before the scene was going to be shot. View this image  John Cho in Star Trek Beyond. Paramount Pictures Justin and Lindsey Weber, our producer, were kind of like, Why dont you just do it? Jung said with a laugh. I was a little self-conscious for my physical appearance. Johns a good-looking guy! But I was thrilled to do it, because it was something we all really believed strongly in, and it was kind of nice to put your money where your mouth is. Although the audience never learns the name of Sulus husband, Jung said that his character was named Ben in the script. And in order to make sense of why Ben would be waiting for Sulu on a Federation outpost in deep space, the screenwriters did develop a small backstory for the character. Ben probably was a civilian, Jung said. They had met probably on some leave, decided to have this child, and then he would have been coming to Yorktown as a full-time resident in order just to be closer to Sulu, whos venturing off into the unknown parts of space. Placing Sulus family on Yorktown also helped to increase the dramatic stakes for the films third act, when Beyonds villain Krall (Idris Elba) threatens to destroy the entire outpost and everyone living on it. There was a scene that I thought was really nice where Sulu expresses a level of guilt that because of his duties, [his husband and daughter] were put into this position where theyre in jeopardy, said Jung. We wrote it, but we never got to shoot it. View this image  Doug Jung and producer Lindsay Weber at the Star Trek Beyond Fan Event on May 20, 2016. Jason Kempin / Getty Images What the filmmakers never wrote into the script, however, was a kiss between Sulu and Ben, out of a desire to make their reunion as prosaic as possible. Its funny, whenever I come home to my wife, I dont always immediately kiss her hello, either, Jung said. At the airport, we sometimes hug, and there are the kids, and it sort of becomes about that. I think it was really important to represent this was a normal family reunion that happens without a lot of fanfare. Ironically, Takeis objections ended up causing a great deal of fanfare, something Pegg clearly understood. Im sure its bittersweet for George, because it should have been him. It just should have been him, he said. It was a disappointment that George didnt see it as the loving acknowledgment of him that it was, but I totally get it. We had long discussions about it over email. And I told him we were going to do it anyway, and he was like, Okay. When its come out in the media, theyve amped it into slightly more of a spat than it really was. It was more like a friendly disagreement. On this point, Takei concurred. We did have an email discussion and agreed to disagree, the actor confirmed to BuzzFeed News via email. It was friendly and I wished him and Star Trek well. Our disagreement was my love and respect for Gene Roddenberry. I emphasized that it wasnt about honoring me or Sulu. But all this hoo-haw will only contribute to the discussion and ultimate box office success of Star Trek Beyond. Its just a tempest in the galactic teapot.  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

My son Troye Sivan told us he was gay at 14. It made me nervous, Mellet wrote in the introduction. His coming out video went viral and we couldnt be prouder of him. But Troye was lucky.

aS"All my life, I worried that wearing flamboyant clothes would mean putting a target on my back. But in the wake of the shooting at Pulse, I realized that Ive been sacrificing a huge part of myself for a safety that was never guaranteed in the first place. View this image  Nick Sumida for BuzzFeed News There comes a time in every young queers life when they are struck by lightning. For me, that time comes on a brisk spring morning in rural Oklahoma, when Im standing behind the middle school, waiting for the bell to ring for first period. Two people are standing with me: Matt and Patrick, both of whom I consider friends. But its complicated. Theyve been acting differently around me lately. Sometimes they suddenly stop talking when I walk up to them. They smirk. They know something I dont. It makes me nervous. Today, Im wearing a green John Deere tractor shirt and jeans that are one size too big. Hey, Matt says to Patrick. He nods in my direction. Talk to him about shirts. An electric pulse shoots down my body. This is it. Ive been caught. All I can do now is play dumb. Shirts? I say. Patrick looks at me. He points. His posturing seems rehearsed, like this is something hes been planning to do. Something hes been practicing. Thats my fucking shirt, he says. Its true. It is his shirt. The person Id like to be doesnt wear John Deere tractor shirts. Instead, he is dressed like the beautiful people in my mothers fashion magazines, which I keep secretly stashed under my bed. He wears elegant jewelry, blouses in exciting patterns and vibrant colors, fabric that flows and moves. Every night I watch The Look for Less (hosted by a pre-Fox News Elisabeth Hasselbeck) on the Style Network with my sister. We like to tear apart the bargain outfits they come up with, because they always fall short of the designer original. I am perhaps the only boy in our little patch of countryside who daydreams about Tyra Banks finding him and recruiting him to be on Americas Next Top Model. Im wearing a John Deere tractor shirt because Im hiding. Im wearing it because I saw Patrick wearing it, and Patrick is a normal boy, and I want to be a normal boy too. Patrick sees it differently. He tells me Im obsessed with him. He tells me hes been catching me looking at him. He tells me Im in love with him. Youre a faggot, he says, and there it is. Lightning. Baptism. The next few months of my life are faggot this and faggot that. There are days when I hear it more than I hear my name. Lunchtime, Patrick slaps a hot dog in my face. You like that, faggot? He says. Faggots are supposed to like that. A soccer game, he kicks a ball at me and it hits me in the groin, smack, sting, I double over. He tells me I dont have a dick. He tells me to stop pretending to be hurt. After queer people are struck by lightning for the first time, we are acutely aware of the space around us of the dark cloud hovering just above our heads. It could strike at any moment. If you look a certain way, if you act a certain way, if you dress a certain way, the odds of being struck go up. Queerness is a breach of contract, one that often carries with it the penalty of violence. Talk to me about shirts. Eleven years later, I sit at This n That, a divey gay bar in Brooklyn, with my friend Levi, who does drag on the side. Its a cute bar, shaped like a TNT barrel on the inside, but it feels cramped tonight. Levi asks if I want to step outside with him while he smokes. Its early May but its chilly and rainy. People wait in line in their coats, then check them at the door to reveal their club attire, their fishnets and their high-waisted shorts and their crop tops. Ive just moved to New York, and like anyone who has ever been tossed into the too-much-ness of this city, Im wrestling with the feeling that Im not standing out enough. That feeling intensifies when Im next to Levi, or, as shes known tonight, Miss Thing. Miss Thing is in her full drag attire hair high to God, a strappy bondage-esque gown with sheer and leather elements, nails so long I wonder how she holds a drink, face beat to perfection. I ask her if she has trouble getting to the bar dressed like that. She laughs. I usually change at the place, she says. But when someone whistles at me I like to slap my ass and wink. I feel the eyes on her from people walking by. Glances. They make me nervous. She doesnt seem to care. My style at this point can best be described as white dad on vacation: floral patterns, my only conceit to femininity, on button-up shirts. Short shorts, a compromise between a strong desire to show skin and a stronger desire to stay in my comfort zone. But thats not the real me. The real me is still very much into fashion and very bored with collared button-ups in every color, pattern, and print. I dont know who made the decision that mens clothing had to be so limited, but all the good stuff is in the womens section. Thats where the interesting jewelry is. Thats where clothes do more than just hang off you. They wrap, they flow, they move. They transform. I tell Miss Thing that I want to start exploring some new looks. Here, in New York, outfits are put together to dazzle and impress. It excites me because these are looks that feel tied to something older, to a queer history Id never embraced. Here was a place where, maybe, I could finally be myself, a place where I could wear the things I want to wear because here, someone else was already wearing it, only better and on roller skates. I also tell Miss Thing that Im afraid. Without going into much detail, I tell her that Ive survived violence in the past. Well, she says, this will be like therapy! The next day, we blink through our hangovers and go shopping in Manhattan. Our first stop is Topshop. Levi, in his boy attire, starts picking things out, things that are already making me nervous. This is cute, he says, holding something up that tells me he thinks Im ready to make the leap from Are you masc, bro? to Season 9 of RuPauls Drag Race. Could we start with something a littleless? I ask. He cackles. You poor thing. He throws me a bone: a black sheer shirt he tells me will show off my chest. I walk into the dressing room. I try it on. I love it. Its not the me Id dreamt of in rural Oklahoma the me I could have been if I had been allowed to grow up uninterrupted but its a baby step in the right direction. The seed of doubt is definitely there, and I worry that it will bloom into full-blown anxiety by the time I get home. But today is about breaking barriers. So I buy it. I take it home in a bag. I put the bag in my closet. It sits there for a month before I return it. Passing the ability to blend in with the straight world is not a privilege all of us queer people have. But a lot of gay men do, including myself. It isnt fun to hide. But it will protect you from lightning. The thing is, I dont really present as myself. I mean that in a way that goes beyond my clothing. Presentation is the way I talk, the way I walk, the way I act, the things I admit to liking, the people I surround myself with, the way I wont hold hands with a guy in public. I present as a negotiation between myself and the space around me, a compromise between vibrancy and violence. Its a compromise queer people around the world make every day. Flamboyancy means drawing attention to yourself. Being openly queer draws attention to yourself. Attention means they see you, and when they see you, they can hurt you. I stick to my boring floral button-ups and short shorts and masculine mannerisms because thats where I feel safe: in the privileged bubble of the gay male mainstream. We, those of us in the mainstream, seem to have departed from our radical roots years ago, a shift that was finalized after the legalization of same-sex marriage in 2015. Being gay never felt more normal, more tolerated, more boring, more safe. I tell myself I will work on being the queer I want to be later, when I feel bold enough to leave the bubble. And then, Pulse. Im in New York when the news breaks. Being a gay Latino working in media today means full immersion. I cant look away. I cant stop reading. My knee-jerk reaction is to take a bus to D.C., the city I lived in before New York, to see my friends. I feel I have to see for myself that theyre alive and OK. After a candlelight vigil in Dupont Circle, my friend Blake and I head to Trade, a local gay bar, for a drink. In the immediate days following the tragedy, the gay bar takes on the sacred significance of a temple. We go without thinking, because thats where were supposed to be. We take turns letting it out the hurt and the fear and the anger because thats what we need. Its dark outside, and the bar is nearly empty. The club lights are on and the music is playing, but for no one in particular. I dont know if its empty because its a Tuesday night or because people are afraid to be here. (Im afraid to be here.) We sit in the window and sip our drinks, watching people on the sidewalk stroll past. Dont they know, he said, how much weve been holding back? I cry a lot in the days that follow. Most of the victims are Latino boys, my community, and that hits me hard. But there is another pain, a reckoning, and I think a lot of gay men and other queer people are in that place with me. I consider all the ways I have muted myself. All the ways I have hidden. All the ways I have held back and apologized and changed. All that, and I can still be killed just for standing in a gay bar. Our senses heightened after Orlando, allowing us to see the world as it had always been and we saw that it was unfair, had always been unfair, even though some of us had become complacent. Why were there gay bars in the first place? Why were people killing us? Dont they know how much weve been holding back? I realize now, in the wake of Orlando, that I have been sacrificing something special for a safety that was never guaranteed in the first place a safety that asked so much of me and gave so little in return, but a safety I had become comfortable with nonetheless. I was used to the spitting and the kicking and the shouting but this, what I was suppressing in myself, was a different kind of violence. I could leave this at the door, leave that at home, stuff those in a closet somewhere, and I would be safe. Orlando changed all of that. I realize, now, everything I have lost. I realize that if a homophobe were to kill me tomorrow, Id die a repressed, second-rate version of the person I could have been. Thats scary. Scarier than the alternative, even, because if Ive learned one thing, its that you can do your best to hide but theyll still find you, even if youre doing your best to walk, talk, dress, and act like everything youre not. I dont want to be something Im not anymore. Even if that something is safer. There will always be the threat of lightning. Theres privilege there. There are queer people here and around the world who cant openly present as themselves without being killed. These are so many oppressive norms we have to dismantle. And while the word dismantle sounds like taking a sledgehammer to a building, today it looks more like skipping down the street with my friends. The four of us are drunk, stumbling out of a nightclub in our head-to-toe looks, glitter and eyeshadow and gold. I never went back for that shirt I returned, but what Im wearing tonight makes up for it, a flowy black number. Youre giving me dumpster sorceress, one of my friends says. I look a mess, to be honest. But thats OK. New York is never bigger than it is on nights like these, when the streets are empty but the lights are on. Theres plenty of time. Theres plenty of space. Faggot! someone yells as we fly by, and Im not sure which one of us hes talking to. But I choose to laugh, and suddenly I feel bigger than the word as it recedes into the night. I dont necessarily feel safe, but I do feel free. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .  Tagged:lgbt, feminine, gay men, gnc, lgbt, style Hey!

aS"As Rhys Ernst and Zackary Drucker went through their gender transitions together, they documented the process in intimate photographs. The Transparent co-producers spoke to BuzzFeed News about collaboration, adolescence, and what happens when the private becomes public especially once a relationship ends. View this image  Zackary Drucker (left) and Rhys Ernst (right) photographed in New York on June 9, 2016 Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Dude, dont be weird, Zackary Drucker told her former romantic partner Rhys Ernst during a photoshoot at BuzzFeeds studios in New York last June. As they stood beside one another, Ernst had turned his face away from Drucker, as if attempting to distance himself from her. He finally settled into a pose. The two stood close together, but looked past each other; they could have been seeing themselves in different mirrors. Their respectful, though sometimes awkward, demeanor in front of the camera speaks to complicated facets of their nearly decade-long association: former romantic partners who continue to be artistic collaborators; trans people who banded together in early transition but lead more separate lives afterward; artists who once photographed each other, but are now navigating how to be photographed by others. Ernst and Drucker are best-known as co-producers of the award-winning Amazon show Transparent. Drucker is also one of the cast members of the Caitlyn Jenner reality show I Am Cait. But before they emerged into mainstream media, Drucker and Ernst became well-known in the art world for a series of photographs exhibited at the Whitney Biennial in 2014, which tracked both their relationship and their gender transitions. The photographs from the series have now been collected into a book, Relationship, that was published last month by Prestel. View this image  photographs from Relationship. Zackary Drucker and Rhys Ernst What art lovers didnt know back in 2014 was that Drucker and Ernst had been growing apart romantically for some time; they decided to break up shortly after they returned to the West Coast to film the Transparent pilot after the biennial. This trajectory is subtly tracked in Relationship: the book begins with playful images of the couple exploring their intimacy along with their transitions, and ends with the two in largely separate frames, either in the dark or behind screens. Rhys and Druckers romantic separation affects both their and our understanding of Relationship now, after two years have passed. The book is constructed to simultaneously evoke both the excitement of transgender people beginning transition and the nostalgia for the rare romantic relationship between two trans people of different genders a relationship that proved ultimately fleeting when they separated after six years. As a result, Relationship is a book that is at once gorgeous and affirming, but also tinged with melancholy. Its precisely the tension that makes this version of the series even more powerful and true than when it was first exhibited. Its been a little bit odd for me to be totally transparent, Ernst said about publishing the book, as he settled onto a blue couch with Drucker. Hes the more private of the pair and had just taken a red-eye flight from L.A., where he and Drucker are based. He discussed how unnerving it has been to see what he had first conceived as private photographs in print ones that Drucker and Ernst were only taking for themselves until Whitney Biennial curator Stuart Comer saw them during a studio visit. Its kind of like publishing a photo book of ones most awkward phase, or transitional phase. An adolescence. The two certainly seemed more settled in their genders as they sat together, Ernst sporting a goatee in T-shirt and jeans, Drucker in a casual tie-dye dress, her large blue eyes framed by bangs. There was between them that familiar push and pull: the attraction that brought them together, and the circumstances that drove them apart. They sat too close to be strangers, yet with a thin invisible barrier that kept them from touching. Most other ex-couples are thrown together like this only on occasion but both Drucker and Ernst, as artistic collaborators, continue to see each other almost every day. And certainly, broken-up couples dont typically publish books of relationship photographs that depict both the second puberty of gender transition and the first blush of a new kind of romantic relationship. View this image  Drucker Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Adolescence functions along multiple fronts in the book, from Drucker and Ernsts shifting bodies to photographs that incorporate smirk-inducing visual puns, like Ernst posing with a sausage on a fork as though ready to bite. But the project also documents the bittersweet coming-of-age of two people in love, who grow into their gender identities as if passing each other through a looking glass. Drucker chooses to focus on how her relationship with Ernst helped both of them through the second puberty of gender transition. We could identify with the puberty experience of the other, you know, and kind of help each other understand the shift of cultural positions too, she said. Drucker described how both she and Ernst were in previous relationships with cisgender people, who had trouble with the idea that their partners would transition, so being with each other felt like a relief. That sense of camaraderie gives Relationship its buoyancy, as the images in the book portray ingenious collaboration on both personal and artistic fronts. Drucker and Ernsts bodies and visions exist together whether theyre in the same image or one is photographing the other; the photographs they make serve as both documentation of their relationship and artistic statements. This sense that Ernst and Drucker are comrades in transition occurs throughout the book, but at Relationships midpoint is an image that encapsulates that camaraderie, and how they serve as symbols for a new type of relationship between transgender people. Drucker is quick to point out that the two are the same height and weight, so this image, of the two standing together in front of a sunset, which was taken on their three-year anniversary, symbolizes the symmetry between the two gendered figures: the way they figuratively and literally mirror each other. Whats surprising, though, is that this scene, in a photograph taken from another angle, serves as the last image in the book. Instead of the camera looking up as though the silhouettes of Drucker and Ernst are to be revered, the angle looks down to the ground at the shadows they cast: the traces of themselves, and a relationship that reached its endpoint. For Ernst, its the camera that gives his relationship with Drucker its lasting quality. I never thought about this before, but that photograph kinda reminds me of working with enlargers, Rhys said, referring to photograms where photographers put an object between light and photo paper. Its the lasting imprints of the light and shadow that something casts and how that creates a permanence. This is the impression Drucker and Ernst want to leave viewers the sense that even as their relationship becomes a shadow of itself, no longer existing in real space and time, the book allows that relationship to continue to exist. Though the book is generally organized chronologically, the order isnt always strict, as they wanted the book to communicate the spiritual arc of their relationship rather than the literal. There was this strong sense of mirroring, and this frustration with ourselves that we had just projected and laminated onto the other person, Drucker said of the end of their relationship. For her, the way they were so similar became a source of tension. View this image  Ernst Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News Ernst, on the other hand, found comfort in the mirroring of their lives. We were more in sync in the first two-thirds of the relationship, he said, and then to me, our orbits started to get more disparate, or ill-weighted, or something like that, and we were not really as in sync as we previously were. Even as both Drucker and Ernst were open to discussing how their relationship evolved and its relationship to the images they produced, they were also careful not to reveal the specifics of how that relationship ultimately ended. This elusive quality is also reflected in the images in Relationship: how both their joys and pains are hinted at rather than explicitly communicated, leaving the viewer to extrapolate on their significance. I think early on I had an epiphany, when Rhys and I started dating, Drucker mused, her already large eyes growing bigger with the memory. I remember I was in the bathtub [and] I was getting ready to go into the club, before anything happened. Here she paused. My epiphany was that Rhys and I would be together and would make an incredible series of photographs. Did you think the photographs? Ernst asked as he grimaced. I dont remember you saying that. After all, part of how the couple had previously described the book was as a set of photographs they only took for themselves, until a curator discovered them and made them public. Maybe that wasnt a part of it, Drucker replied hesitantly. Ernst let out an awkward laugh, and said, This was before we had gotten together, though, as though righting a mirror that was momentarily askew. Like a photograph, the other person in a relationship, regardless of how similar they may seem, is always an imperfect mirror, their sameness a projection of a human desire for complete understanding that ultimately proves impossible. But its exactly in that shifting place between sameness and difference, transition and permanence, that Relationship dwells, and allows the book to be a powerful chronicle of trans togetherness.

aS"The NSW government says the ban still stands, but has offered behind the scenes support. View this image  Australian documentary Gayby Baby, about four young people raised by same-sex parents, made headlines in August last year when it was banned by the government from being shown in NSW classrooms during school hours. View this image  After last years screenings in NSW were cancelled by the government, we are delighted to announce that Gayby Baby is celebrating LGBTIQ pride on Wear It Purple Day once more this time with the full support of the NSW Department of Education and the Victorian Government, the email read. View this image  Mars said the Gayby Baby team had had a number of positive meetings with the NSW Department of Education, saying theres been a lot of support there. There are some real heroes who have come forward in the department, and worked with us, and thats why we wrote it in the newsletter, she said. Mars said she felt confused by the request to amend the email. The department has been so positive with us, and then to ask for the change, its a very mixed message, she said. A spokesperson for education minister Adrian Piccoli told BuzzFeed News, NSW public schools determine which resources they use to support their academic, student wellbeing and other programs, complying with departmental policies and procedures as required. The department does not endorse externally produced resources. View this image  The toolkit, which provides lesson ideas and plans about different types of families including single parents, same-sex parents, and Indigenous kinship families has been downloaded for use by teachers over 600 times. Part of the reason the ban came about is because [the department] wasnt sure how it fit with the curriculum. Weve now answered that so completely, Mars said. In my heart, I feel there is no possible way for it to be cancelled or banned again this year. Asked about Gayby Baby specifically, Piccolis spokesperson said the advice given in August last year was still in place. The film must not be shown in school time so that it does not impact on the delivery of the planned lessons of the day, that advice reads. Screening the film may be considered if it is an integral part of the planned curriculum for an age appropriate year group. If a school decides to screen the film outside schools hours or as an integral part of the curriculum all relevant policy and procedures must be followed. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"I wanted to make a point about love having no bar on gender. Calcutta-based fashion photographer, Amit Dey, recently did a photo series titled Coy Mistress. It focuses on the dual lives that people from the LGBT community have to live because of the pressures of society. Being bisexual himself and having noticed his friends from the community, he realised that a lot of people were hiding their sexual identities, with all parties suffering in the process.

aS"Its just flat-out homophobia. View this image  Brandon Hamilton and Barrett Morrison told BuzzFeed Canada they visited Canadas Wonderland in mid-June, on what is known as Gay Day, an annual event organized by PFLAG Canada to promote LGBTQ issues and visibility. While waiting to get into the waterpark, the young staff member told them someone had complained about them hugging. View this image  They told the employee the complaint itself was offensive, and that Canadian law protects from from discrimination based on their sexual orientation. We dont necessarily blame the kid who approached us, Hamilton said. I think he was just relaying a message [from a woman in line] and didnt think about what he was saying. The employee agreed and immediately apologized, they said, but they were frustrated that park staff werent better trained to handle such situations. Its so offensive and absurd that anyone would consider that not family friendly. Its just flat-out homophobia, Morrison said. View this image  The only visible thing we could see of Gay Day was the fact there was a PFLAG booth out front, in front of the entrance to the park, Barrett told BuzzFeed Canada. Norm Pirtovshek, the parks general manager, apologized to the couple but said staff already received extensive training on avoiding discrimination. He also didnt commit to expanding Gay Day, saying the park had to treat all groups equally. Although they appreciated the quick apology, Hamilton and Morrison said the response felt dismissive of their concerns. View this image  A park spokesperson said there are no plans to do so, though. We partner with more than 5,000 groups, communities and companies each season and therefore dont designate a day to any given group, Soulla Lindo told BuzzFeed Canada. But weve enjoyed our partnership with PFLAG in hosting this annual event and we hope they will return again in 2017.

aS"The six-episode web series is the only independently produced project nominated for Outstanding Short Form Comedy or Drama Series, a new category this year. View this image  Jen Richards and Laura Zak / Speed of Joy Productions The Outstanding Short Form Comedy or Drama Series category was newly added to the competition this year. We had hope, certainly, because weve seen incredible momentum and support to date, series star Laura Zak told BuzzFeed News in a phone interview on Thursday. Still, we all thought [a nomination] was pretty unlikely. If you see the other projects that were nominated, you can see the source of our caution. The other projects nominated include shows from AMC, Lifetime, Adult Swim, and ComedyCentral.com making Her Story the only independently produced series to receive a nomination in this category.Im surprised, yes, but also Im a little bit not surprised because, spiritually speaking, weve been calling this through fruition, Angelica Ross, a series regular and prominent figure in the trans community, added in Thursdays phone interview. The moment @la_wa & I & @speed_of_joy found out @HerStoryShow nominated for @TheEmmys @angelicaross @SmartAssJen Angelica Ross herstoryshow.com Its just nice to have a women-centered and powered project where we all so solid as friends and collaborators, Zak added. Zak credits much of the shows success to Fisher, who used much of her own funds, plus independent fundraising, to bring Her Story to life. The entire team has been working to get the show, which is available for free on YouTube, produced as a full series. Her believing in the project and putting her money where her mouth was and throughout it all be loving and humble we couldnt have done it without her.

View this image  Steve Marcus / Reuters Cruz, ranked fifth in the junior lightweight division by the World Boxing Organization, was also in Orlando, Florida, earlier this week to pay his respects to the victims of the June 12 massacre at the Pulse nightclub. The campaign, a venture between All Star Boxing, Inc. and Mi Familia Vota, will include advertisements on the corners of the fighting ring and on clothing worn by boxers shown on Boxeo Telemundo, a leading boxing show on Spanish-language television, through the summer. Through the campaign we hope Latinos in the U.S. will go out to vote in large numbers without fear and make their voices heard, Cruz told BuzzFeed News. Its important because as immigrants, many of whom who come here to look for stability, we have to advocate for our rights.

He worked at Forever 21 as a visual merchandizer and studied at Inter American University of Puerto Rico. Cruz said he was upset at what appeared to be a direct attack on the LGBT community. It really affected me and made me angry to see that among so many dead was my close friend, Cruz said. Gay people have rights just like everybody else and everyone needs to realize that we deserve to live openly and happy.

aS"Its not as difficult as people think it is. View this image  Oscar Riddell Its never-ending, he says, eyes shining. Everything leads to everything else, everything connects. The more you look, the more you learn. This enthusiastic lecture is taking place in an unlikely venue: a Nandos restaurant in the country town of Shepparton, Australia. Its cold and wet outside, but the chicken chain is bustling: families sharing platters, teenagers drifting in and out clutching Cokes, and Oscar, waxing lyrical in the corner. Oscars own biology is of some interest to him. In precisely 14 days, he tells me, he will turn 18 and start taking testosterone, which will prompt the development of facial hair, shift around fat and muscle, and deepen his voice. But his mind immediately snaps to other things when I ask what, in politics, concerns him most. I dont really keep up with the news, he says, pausing for a second. But there are some things like superbugs. Superbugs? I think about how everyone is taking antibiotics all the time when they dont need to be, he explains. Thats going to lead to an advance in superbugs that were not going to be able to cure. Unless kids start focusing on biology. Its an unexpected answer from a member of a generation marked as self-absorbed. But Oscar had to defeat biology, and its social baggage, before he could plan to devote his life to it. He was prompted to come out as transgender in mid-2015, because living in the closet was affecting his health, his happiness, and his grades.I had to transition in the last two years, because I wanted to go to university, he says, matter-of-factly. I knew it would help me with my grades, so I came out. About 30,000 people live in Shepparton, Victoria. Its a typical Aussie town in many ways: a busy main drag that evaporates of life after dark, a thriving sporting culture, and underlying problems with unemployment, poverty, and ice. But one way in which Shepparton stands out is its LGBT community: tight-knit, highly organised, and perhaps most remarkably visible. You can come out and stay out in Shepparton, without fleeing to Melbourne to find a queer home. View this image  Lane Sainty / BuzzFeed The second unusual thing about Sheppartons young LGBT community is that its not dominated by gay and lesbian people. Specifically, there are lots of transgender guys. Theres something in the water, jokes Zane Scott, 23. Zane is transgender, and exists on the cusp of the two LGBT groups in Shepparton: Diversity, for high-schoolers through to age 24, and Goulburn Valley Pride, for adults. View this image  Some members of Goulburn Valley Pride. Lane Sainty / BuzzFeed At a meeting of GV Pride, the group discusses how being transgender compares to being bisexual, lesbian, or gay in Shepparton. A number of transgender guys in their late teens and early 20s have come out over the past few years, and the group says its slowly becoming more accepted. Trans is still its not a huge deal. But its still a big deal, Zane says. Oscar, who will finish Year 12 this year, says his school experience has been mostly good. Another guy came out as trans about a year earlier, and people knew the deal. But there have been some issues with toilets, and the bunks at school camp. They make me use the disabled toilets, he says. Theres only two disabled toilets at the school, and I feel weird going into that one. Im not disabled. Other people need that one. Oscar won the school camp argument, and will bunk in with the other boys. But the toilets is an ongoing discussion. Still, Oscar is generous. Ive had it really easy compared to some kids, he says. Anakie Crocker, 19, is a trans man from neighbouring Mooroopna. His name is the result of a rather drastic spelling error, committed by his mother, on his birth registration form. It was meant to be A-N-A-R-C-H-Y, he explains. As in, the political philosophy? Yeah. Do you like your name? Um, I wish it was spelled correctly. View this image  Anakie Crocker Anakie struggled at a public high school, and would have finished Year 12 this year had he not dropped out. It was a combination of fielding awkward questions from peers, teachers not understanding his situation, and medical issues that led to him feeling like he couldnt finish. Most of it was really dumb questions that youve got to get out of the way. When are you having the surgery? Is it gay if I have sex with you? Can you get a girl pregnant? He laughs. Stuff like that. But life is looking up for Anakie since he left school and moved out of home. The average week, he says, is his phone buzzing every five minutes the small but highly active Diversity group making plans. Do you want to come to [local pub] The Deck? Do you want to go see a movie? Go for coffee? he says. Were always doing the same things, but its fun. All in all, Anakie says, being a trans guy in Shepparton is not as difficult as people think it is. Ive heard a lot of people have these terrible assumptions. Oh, poor you, youre from a rural town, you must get chased out of town. No. Its quite supportive. The trans men of Shepparton might feel supported, but access to medical treatment is a problem acceptance cant fix. The two biggest barriers are travel and money. View this image  Lane Sainty / BuzzFeed News Theres no gender therapist in Shepparton, which is normal for a country town. But its difficult for a young person from the country to transition, and the multiple appointments and confirmations and clarifications required add up. Oscars supportive mother has to take days off work to get him to Melbourne for the treatment he needs. [The therapist] does Skype appointments, but the Skype never works, so you know. Oscar smiles and shrugs. And then all the endocrinologists are in Melbourne, so everywhere you go, you have to travel. The surgeon is in Melbourne. The appointments are expensive, you pay for testosterone. It [adds] up. Anakie, who simply says I dont have a car, or money, has been saving to take the train down to Melbourne to get an appointment with a GP to get an appointment with a gender therapist to get an appointment with an endocrinologist. He sums up his situation with three syllables and a forced smile: Still pre-T. Anakie has also found it hard to access mental health services who are trained in transgender issues. Ive sought out counselling locally, and Ive spoken to other trans friends about seeking help. They all said Go to Melbourne. Its not worth looking in Shepp, they are completely oblivious to trans topics. In this context, of not being able to get the treatment he needs, Anakie is scathing of the attacks on the Safe Schools Coalition. He says the much-discussed Minus18 article about chest-binding often misrepresented as part of the official school program actually saved him from medical complications. If it wasnt for that article, I would still be using a waist compression band on my chest, which can cause a lot of trouble, he says. Its a lot thicker than what a binder should be, and it compresses more and more. The city lights of Melbourne are appealing for a lot of teenagers in Shepparton. Recently, Diversity travelled down for the annual Minus18 formal, where Oscar wore his first suit. In the photo he texts to me captioned Found one where I look decent, haha hes posing proudly on a bench in the main street, looking dapper as can be. View this image  Lane Sainty / BuzzFeed News But while Oscar, Anakie, and other Shepparton trans guys acknowledge the benefits of Melbourne for medical access, and sheer quantity of events, theyre not at all dismissive of the little community theyve created in Shepparton. In fact, Oscar thinks he has the better end of the deal. I think it would be harder in Melbourne, he says. Its so much bigger. No one really talks to each other, it seems really distant. You walk down the street, its crowded. Here, you walk down the street and see 10 people you know on your way. Unlike many LGBT people who grow up in the country, Oscar sees a future in his hometown. He wants to move to Melbourne to study biology, of course. And after that? Ill come back to Shepparton. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"This is an unfortunate incident and the entire transgender community as a whole is completely disgusted, a trans activist told BuzzFeed News. View this image  The Target in Ammon, Idaho. Google Maps A self-identifying transgender woman was arrested Monday after secretly taking photos of a teenage girl in a changing room in an Idaho Target, authorities said. Shauna Patricia Smith, whose legal name is Sean Patrick Smith, was arrested Tuesday by the Bonneville County Sheriffs Office and charged with one count of voyeurism, Sgt. Bryan Lovell told BuzzFeed News. Authorities allege Smith, 43, used a cell phone to secretly record an 18-year-old girl who was trying on a bathing suit in a fitting room at the Target in Ammon, near Idaho Falls. Smith allegedly held the iPhone over the top of a barrier separating two changing rooms. Smith allegedly fled when confronted by the teenagers mother, according to an affidavit of probable cause obtained by Eastern Idaho News. The two women described Smith as a white male who was wearing a dress and a blonde wig, according to the affidavit. A witness told investigators they observed Smith flee the scene in a vehicle, which was traced to Smith. A roommate told authorities Smith identified as a transgender woman, according to an affidavit. Detectives were able to review witness information and security footage from Target that led them to come in contact with 43-year-old Sean Patrick Smith, who also identifies as Shauna Patricia Smith, a transgender female, Sgt. Lovell told BuzzFeed News in a statement. View this image  Smith Bonneville County Sheriff's Office Sierra Gormsen, a trans woman who helped run the Eastern Idaho Transgender Support Group until it disbanded in 2014, told BuzzFeed News Smith contacted her in May requesting information about the organization. They said that they dressed as a woman when they could. They had plans to change their name, Gormsen said in an email. I am uncertain if they were seeing a therapist, had been diagnosed with Gender Identity Dysphoria, was on hormones, or planned surgery of any type. A current inmate listing for the Bonneville County Sheriffs Office says Smith is being held in the local county jail. He was booked into jail as a male because that is his current gender, Lovell said in a subsequent phone call. Smith is listed as being housed in a section marked SH, which Lovell said stands for special housing. In the affidavit, a detective wrote that Smith admitted to filming videos of women changing clothes. The defendant eventually admitted to me that she had made videos in the past of women undressing, Detective Zeb Graham wrote. The defendant told me that she makes these videos for the same reason men go online to look at pornography. The defendant told me that she finds the videos sexually gratifying. Smith asked the detective to unlock the iPhone and look at the camera roll, according to the affidavit, where Graham allegedly observed a video of a young adult female undressing in a changing room at what appears to be Target. The defendant admitted to me that this video was recorded at Target, Graham said. View this image  Google Maps Amid a national debate over nondiscrimination laws for LGBT individuals, Target attracted the ire of some conservatives when the company announced in April that it would allow employees and customers to use the restroom that corresponds with their gender identity. Opponents of nondiscrimination laws, particularly those centered around transgender rights in bathrooms and dressing rooms, have asserted that such laws would expose young girls to predatory behavior from men posing as women. View this image  Smith Facebook In cities and states with nondiscrimination laws, there have been no reported incidents of men falsely claiming to be trans women while committing crimes in restrooms. Emilie Jackson-Edney, a transgender woman who facilitates the Boise-based Tri-States Transgender Group, said she was saddened to hear that the alleged crime occurred in a Target. Im disappointed something like this occurred because I think that theres a possibility it could be sensationalized when it should be used to show law enforcement is working, she said. Gormsen, who now operates a trans support group in Washington state, said Smiths alleged actions should not be used to color the actions of the transgender community. In all reality, being transgender has nothing to do with this and really is an unnecessary detail, she said. If they are transgender, this would be the first time a transgender person has been guilty of such a crime. This is an unfortunate incident and the entire transgender community as a whole is completely disgusted by Smiths actions, she said. The actions of one now has the power to fuel a setback in equality for all genders. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS'The latest move from the school district, which has been attempting to keep a transgender student from using the restroom in accordance with his gender identity. [Update: Lawyers for the student opposed the schools request on July 26.] View this image  Mandel Ngan / AFP / Getty Images WASHINGTON A Virginia school board on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to put two court rulings on hold so that it can prevent a transgender student from using the restroom in accordance with his gender identity while the school board appeals the rulings against the board. Gavin Grimm sued the Gloucester County School Board after it implemented a policy restricting students to restrooms reflecting their biological gender. Grimm, a transgender student, recently received a victory in the case when the trial court judge issued an injunction against the school board applying the policy against him. The school board previously announced it would be asking the Supreme Court to review an appeals court ruling in the students case, but Wednesdays request asks the justices in a filing made to Chief Justice John Roberts to issue a stay of the appeals court ruling and the district court injunction. If granted, the stays would allow the school board to apply its policy against Grimm at the start of the coming school year.

aS"The votes were initially miscounted. View this image  The church membership gathered in Toronto this week for a General Synod, a meeting held every three years where resolutions regarding doctrine are voted on by three orders of the church: bishops, clergy, and lay people. Percentages show motion to allow same-sex marriage fails to get 2/3 majority from clergy; loses by 1 vote But some people raised concerns that the votes had been improperly tallied, touching off a recount that found General Secretary Michael Thompsons vote had been counted as a lay vote instead of clergy. This one vote changed the outcome of resolution A051-R2 the resolution to amend the marriage canon, Thompson later said in a statement. This vote has been difficult for many, and no outcome can address all of our churchs need to live and work together. We have a long road ahead to restore our common life. View this image  Our work on this matter is not done, he said. Its not sufficient for us to simply say we dealt with the resolution. For Americans watching #gs2016: If marriage canon change is passed at this synod, only goes into effect if passed again at #gs2019. The Anglican church already recognizes the integrity and sanctity of committed adult same-sex relationships after passing a resolution to that effect in 2004. Some months ago, I made a commitment not to participate in any sacraments until I could participate in all of them. Today I can. #GS2016 It does mean this is becoming a reality and a norm in our church, and Im very grateful for that, she said. And it means that I belong. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Because theres nothing like a fresh cut to make you feel 100% you. View this image  And while its impossible for someone to look queer, it is fun to experiment with your personal style and ~ look~ while youre figuring everything out. View this image  View on Instagram Provided to BuzzFeed Provided to BuzzFeed I wanted to stand out on the soccer field and didnt want a ponytail, so I decided to do a mohawk. Everyone was interested and it really made people think, I wonder if shes gay? Now I think, Dear lord, I had a lot of guts to do that back in 2003! I drastically changed my hairstyle again a year ago when I moved to New York. I wanted to change my appearance and what everyone had previously known me for. I wanted to change with my surroundings. My hair is really my vocal piece of my upper body region. View this image  Provided to BuzzFeed Provided to BuzzFeed The photo on the left was taken at the beginning of my sophomore year of college. I had selectively come out to some people already, but I wasnt OUT-out. That semester, I became an intern at Bumble & Bumble, where they gave all their employees even the interns free haircuts. I had always been curious to go short as an adult (my mom gave me a horrendous pixie when I was a kid and basically put me off short hair for-almost-ever), so I figured there was no better time than with a free $200 haircut that I would never pay for. Most people knew I was gay after that, and, as a result, I actually was able to date, which was cool. There was some serious gender navigation after the cut, but there still is sometimes, I suppose, depending on my mood and, well, my haircut! View this image  provided to BuzzFeed Provided to BuzzFeed I wanted to stand out to other people, and I thought that colorful, short hair would catch more ladies eyes. It wasnt perfect but I still love it and would do it again, not to gain attention but to give myself more confidence. My hairstyle changes a lot. I have been doing a lot of protective hairstyles lately, but I do let my natural hair flow in between stylings. My hair is an expression of my rise in confidence in myself and my love for creativity and change. View this image  Provided to BuzzFeed Provided to BuzzFeed I was always known for having a thick side braid for all of high school. One day I said, Screw this! and I chopped it all off. My haircut truly changed my life, I became a million times more confident. I absolutely loved my hair, something I was never able to say my entire life. After more than a year of having it short, I realized that cutting my hair felt so liberating because I am genderqueer. My hair actually helped me understand my gender identity. After the first awkward months of learning how to style, or not style, my hair, I started to get the hang of it. People say my celeb look alike is Rachel Maddow best compliment ever. View this image  Provided to BuzzFeed Provided to BuzzFeed I came out to my parents over the phone while on a semester in Australia, and in the same convo said I was planning on dying my hair pink in L.A. before coming home. My dad said, Since you came out to us (five minutes ago) youve really gone off the rails. I have the best parents. Coming home, newly out and newly pink, felt like I was reborn in image, but loved for who I had always been. And, Im still rocking pink! Im literally getting my roots redone as I write. It feels like an expression of who I am now: young, finding myself, and bright AF. View this image  Provided to BuzzFeed Provided to BuzzFeed I had a huge fringe that I blew upwards and pinned into some sort of huge quiff/mohawk. After coming into my gay identity, I wanted to feel as though people would really be able to see me. It was a real manifestation of my newfound sense of pride and rainbow affiliation. Looking back, I feel 100% mortified, 100% of the time. I looked like the human descendant of a pack of (very proud) unicorns. But in saying that, I also look back on it with fondness and love. That was a period of my life that saw me claim my identity, and thats something I am very proud of. Your gender performance can be as effeminate or as masculine as you authentically are. So my haircut no longer need to speak for who I am, because I am now fully capable of doing that on my own. View this image  Provided to BuzzFeed Provided to BuzzFeed I had finally come to terms with my asexuality and one day I looked in the mirror and thought, I need to be true to myself. I invited a few close pals who I trusted and they came for the emotional support. Im so glad they were able to share the experience with me. I cried when it was over because for the first time in my life I actually liked the person I saw in front of me. Theres not a day that goes by that I dont feel absolutely handsome, is amazing how something as cosmetic as hair can change your entire life. I like to tell people I keep my hair like myself, nice and short. View this image  I started going bald at 16. By the time I was 21, I had started shaving my head, but thankfully I had a beard. My coming-out hairstyle was just me dyeing my beard green. It was a birthday gift to me. I think I just wanted people to look at me in a different light and not see the same old Dhruv. A guy flirted with me in public for the first time after I dyed my beard its kind of a big deal in India. I think I might just go back to it. Whenever I see that picture, I think, I was so brave. View this image  Provided to BuzzFeed Provided to BuzzFeed I went with the typical Bieber my junior year of high school. It was so clich that I would make fun of myself, but it really helped me figure out how I wanted to view myself. I played along with the jokes and it kind of became my trademark at school. I also stopped going to hairdressers and I cut my own hair, so every time its exactly what I want. My hair has always been one of my best features, even before I came out, so I take a lot of pride in making sure my hair looks good and that it represents how I see myself. View this image  Provided to BuzzFeed Provided to BuzzFeed Getting my hair cut was just the final piece of the puzzle. It was like kissing a girl for the first time. You get this feeling of, Oh shit, what did I just do? But then it turns into, Oh, this is how its supposed to be. It made me feel complete. Looking back, I wish I would have found a better hairstyle, but I dont regret it. It allowed me to become more comfortable with my own style and just solidified that I never want to wear a dress again. It lets me be the dapper AF girl I always knew I was. View this image  Provided to BuzzFeed Provided to BuzzFeed Haircuts when you were a young teen can be pretty embarrassing when you remember them as an adult. I feel obviously embarrassed since I asked my stylist for a Joe Jonas haircut at the time ([the Jonas Brothers] were pretty big back then). But I felt empowered by it and it helped other gay kids identify me in school so I could become friends with some of them. Since the Joe Jonas haircut Ive had long hair, pink hair, and now that Im an adult, I have a curly side bob. It has stuck for almost three years now, and I like how versatile it is I can style it very big and crazy. View this image  Provided to BuzzFeed Provided to BuzzFeed Ive always been super tomboy and I remember always wanting short hair, even before I knew I was gay. Ive always really been into guys fashion and hairstyles. So when I came out, I was so ready to chop it all off. Cutting my hair off made me feel so complete and so confident confidence I didnt know I had. I never regret cutting my hair off maybe the style, but Im happy with my choice of short hair. My hairstyle now still gives me confidence, and getting my hair cut still makes me feel like 100 bucks. View this image  View this image  After coming out and ending a long-term relationship, I felt like I had made a lot of changes in my life very quickly and I wanted a new hairstyle to go with it. Around the same time, my aunt was diagnosed with breast cancer and lost her hair during treatment. So, when I got my hair cut, I donated it. At first, the haircut made me feel nervous because I had never been so visibly queer before. But that feeling only lasted a short time, and I got comfortable with it really quickly. I noticed that I started to get a lot more attention from other women in the community after I got my hair cut. Looking back at it, I still feel really happy about my decision and I would cut all of my hair off again in a heartbeat. View this image  Provided to BuzzFeed Provided to BuzzFeed The moment I came out to my parents the only thing they asked me to do was to not cut my hair. So, naturally, I did. For the sake of not getting put on house arrest until my hair grew back, I went and got a simple undercut with a design. The moment I got it cut, I felt so much more confident in myself. I felt more visible in the LGBQT community (even though I dont think a haircut defines your sexuality). Looking back, I think making this small change was enough to make myself feel more comfortable with who I am. I have kept my undercut to this day though I no longer do any crazy designs, I keep it clean and trim it constantly. View this image  Provided to BuzzFeed Provided to BuzzFeed I wanted to stop trying to look a certain way to make other people comfortable and just finally be myself. I felt like my family was OK with me being gay as long as I didnt look like I was one of those gays. And so the haircut was my way of breaking away from what everyone wanted me to be. However, looking back now, I realize I was still trying to please other people. I ended up getting a much more feminine cut than I wanted because i was afraid of going too masculine and upsetting everyone. What I really wanted was a dapper, fresh undercut.

aS'At least 15 seats changed from opposition to support this election. View this image  Marianna Massey / Getty Images A free vote in the parliament is the preferred course of Labor, the Greens and various crossbenchers and advocates hope the legislation for the national plebiscite will be stymied in the senate, forcing a free vote on the issue. Peak advocacy group Australian Marriage Equality say this election has ushered more supporters of marriage equality than ever into the parliament. BuzzFeed News confirmed at least 15 seats where an MP who opposed marriage equality or was undeclared on the issue has been replaced with an MP who definitely supports marriage reform. In the last parliament, support for same-sex marriage was on a knife edge. With the shift of at least 15 seats, and potentially more, it appears a change to the Marriage Act would now easily pass the House of Representatives, but only if both major parties allowed their MPs a free vote. View this image  Martin Bernetti / AFP / Getty Images BARTON: Liberal marriage equality opponent Nickolas Varvaris out, Labor marriage equality supporter Linda Burney in.

MURRAY: Liberal opponent Sharman Stone retired, replaced by Nationals supporter Damian Drum. PATERSON: Liberal opponent Bob Baldwin retired, replaced by Labor supporter Meryl Swanson. New MPs in seats including Dobell and Chisholm did not respond to a request from BuzzFeed News for clarification on their position on marriage equality. At the time of writing, the seats of Herbert and Hindmarsh are yet to be called. View this image  Peter Parks / AFP / Getty Images Well, this is the first House of Representatives that looks to have a clear majority in support of same-sex marriage from the get-go. However, while Labor leader Bill Shorten continues to call for a free vote to be held, the Coalition is determined to press ahead with the national plebiscite. The Coalition needs to pass legislation before the plebiscite can be held. Its slim majority in the House of Representatives should guarantee passage, with or without the support of the opposition and crossbenchers. But the Senate is where it gets tricky. View this image  Stefan Postles / Getty Images In support of the plebiscite are the Coalition and, notionally, One Nation (party leader Pauline Hanson is actually calling for a constitutional referendum, but may settle for a plebiscite). Opposed are Labor, the Greens, Nick Xenophon Team and Derryn Hinch. However, it is currently unclear whether their opposition would extend to actually blocking the legislation that would pave the way for the plebiscite. In short, stay tuned. UPDATE: With the seat of Hindmarsh called, there are now 16 confirmed seats where an MP who opposed or was undecided on marriage equality has been replaced with a supporter. New Liberal MP for Chisholm Julia Banks has confirmed to BuzzFeed News that she is a supporter of marriage equality. Previous Labor MP Anna Burke was also a supporter, meaning there is no change in Chisholm on the issue.

aS"Exclusive: Tyler Luke Cunningham, star of the BBCs Boy Meets Girl sitcom, told BuzzFeed News how his transition and his fight to keep his sister alive became entwined. View this image  Matthew Tucker / BuzzFeed As a teenager, when I was coming out, I said to my mum, Either you want a dead daughter or a happy son. We are just a few minutes into the interview. Tyler Luke Cunningham, the new star of the much-fted BBC sitcom Boy Meets Girl the first to focus on a trans character is talking in a sparse, echoing meeting room in the offices of the shows production company. His press officer, who has never heard what hes about to reveal, sits frozen and silent. I couldnt see a future, says Cunningham. As the actor begins describing what he had to do to convince those around him that being transgender was not a phase but life-and-death, he does so with such a plain, unsentimental delivery it takes a while to realise why. Transitioning to become the man that he is taking hormones, telling his family and friends was not, it transpires, the hardest, nor the most extraordinary of his experiences. His life was also not the only one he had to save. That story comes later, however, once hes rattled through his own. The speed of his delivery prevents any lingering on painful memories, but also suggests something else: an acute sense of urgency. There are not many 20-year-olds, perhaps none other, who have both embarked on the transition process and also forged a successful acting career, snatching a part in the second series of a primetime sitcom. His character in Boy Meets Girl is Charlie, a tough/sweet friend to Judy, the lead, played by Rebecca Root. He did not expect to win the part hed never seen the show, he says and so was shocked but really happy. Tiger Aspect / BBC Tiger Aspect / BBC Rebecca Root (left) and Tyler Luke Cunningham in Boy Meets Girl. The shock was not only down to the slim chance for any actor of being cast in a hit show. Just five years ago, aged 15, everything was turmoil. There were a lot of problems in my life at that point, says Cunningham. Everything was a blur in my head, foggy, I wasnt sure what was going on. I had a very ill sister and a mum who wasnt very well herself, who was having to deal with my ill sister and deal with my bad behaviour as a result of me not knowing what was going on in my head. His sister Keyleigh, who is seven years older, had been diagnosed with aplastic anaemia, a rare, life-threatening blood disease in which red and white blood cells as well as platelets stop being produced properly, causing a dangerous deficiency. His mother has lupus, an incurable disease in which the bodys own immune system attacks healthy cells. Cunningham, therefore, was trying desperately to manage what was happening both in his family and in himself. I didnt know who I was, he says, trying to explain what that meant. I remember looking into my future in my head and I could never see my face. I can understand why some young trans people dont feel that theres a way out. He adds, swiftly, They need to know that there is. It took Cunningham a while to realise this himself. I was very angry and confused and I wasnt the easiest person to speak to, he says. The problems did not only manifest internally, but also to such an extent externally as to trigger an explosion in his home life. I went into care, he says, in the middle of a sentence, as if it is worthy only of passing mention. He was still only 15. What happened? My mum couldnt deal with my bad behaviour anymore. I was completely acting out. She was under a lot of pressure, looking after an ill daughter. She just couldnt cope understandably. It made sense for her. As an adult himself now it might well be understandable, but at the time? It seemed like my mum was doing the worst thing in the world. Cunningham lets out a small laugh the same laugh as when he mentioned the bad behaviour that proved so difficult for his mother. It is more of a quick release of breath, as if momentarily unscrewing the nozzle on a pumped bicycle tyre. He was in care for 11 months. It proved pivotal. If I didnt get away from my family at that point I may never have realised who I was, he says. Unbeknown to his mother, the space and time apart was exactly what Cunningham needed. I can only thank her for it, in a way. It was the right thing to do. View this image  Matthew Tucker / BuzzFeed On his return to the family home in London, two further transformative events took place. First, now aged 16, he started to tell those around him who he was. Theres always going to be that shock factor when you come out as trans its still quite taboo but now that I look back, they did get over it quite quickly, he says, avoiding spelling out how instrumental he must have been in moulding the reactions. There were people saying, Are you sure its not this or that? I had to be sure to make everybody else sure. I had to make people understand that I was being totally serious about this. And when he told his mother, making it clear that there was one option: transition or die, she quickly accepted what he was saying. I think it sunk in quite well, he says, with knowing understatement. At Cunninghams drama college (Platinum Performing Arts school in north London) which he attended for five years, there were, he says, some obstacles to ensuring people used the correct pronoun. But for Cunningham it proved another vital escape, an outlet for expression when he needed it most, both pre-transition and while I was transitioning. All the people around me are very accepting black, white, man, woman and those who arent just arent in my life, he says. There was someone else who supported him throughout: his girlfriend, Lovelle. Ive been with her just over two years, he says. She just took me for who I wanted to be; shes loved me from before [transitioning]. Ive grown into the man Ive wanted to be and shes wanted me to become as well. She gave me courage and strength to go about my daily life, because I know theres someone there who loves me. When they first met aged 17, when Cunningham was living as a man but not yet taking hormones, there was a much more immediate issue to confront, the one that now seems to dwarf everything. My sisters body was shutting down, he says flatly. The disease had been causing terrible damage for a while: bleeding from her mouth, bruising so quickly that even a touch would leave a mark. Keyleigh had to move back home to be looked after, giving up her job as a pastry chef in a top London hotel, but her condition only declined. Patients require regular blood transfusions to keep their blood levels up, platelet transfusions to avoid bleeding and bruises, and they are prone to life-threatening infections due to their low white cell count, says Olga Nikolajeva, medical officer at the Anthony Nolan Trust, a leukaemia and bone barrow transplant charity. Patients with aplastic anaemia often develop blood cancers later on in life if they dont receive a bone marrow or stem cell transplant. Cunningham Cunningham Keyleigh (left) and Cunningham with his family. And although aplastic anaemia is not a form of cancer, it is sometimes treated like it, says Cunningham. So his sister underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy, while also having her eggs harvested so if she survived she had a chance of becoming a mother. The treatment did not work. She was on life support, says Cunningham. I remember walking into hospital, seeing her on life support for the first time, and bursting into tears. She just wasnt there. She almost died twice. Her pupils werent dilating, all her organs were shutting down. They [the doctors] said, Shes about to go. There was only one option left: a bone marrow transplant. The hospital began a frantic search but there was an acute shortage of potential donors. Only 1.7% of people in the UK are registered as donors, says Nikolajeva. In particular, she says, there is a lack of young men and people from black, Asian, and ethnic minority backgrounds. Having failed to find an anonymous donor from the register, the hospital instead considered Cunninghams family. His parents were unable to donate, and so it fell to him. I thought, OK, I just have to go through with it, he says. The process began with two injections twice a day for four days to spark in Cunningham an overproduction of bone marrow. I then had to go into hospital for two days, as a day patient, get dripped up, with about four different drips in my arms. Then they used a dialysis machine to take the bone marrow from my blood before it was given to my sister. But after the transplant, Keyleighs condition worsened dramatically. She almost died again, says Cunningham. Because my bone marrow was a foreign body to her, her body went into crisis and she was back on life support for a while. Eventually, however, she pulled through. The transplant began to work. View this image  Matthew Tucker / BuzzFeed Cunningham was there the day the doctors began to wake her up. Still with tubes down her throat, he says, Keyleigh could not speak. And so Cunningham devised a way to communicate with her. I got some paper towels and wrote every letter of the alphabet on them with a felt-tip pen, he says. I went along the letters and said, Blink once if its yes and twice if its a no. He hoped that this way he could decipher what she wanted to say. In a nutshell, he says with a smile, she wanted her handbag and her mobile. That was it. Keyleigh came out of hospital to begin the process of recovery. But while still receiving treatment from home, it wasnt long before she felt ill again. She went for a checkup, they checked her back thinking it was her liver, they turned her over, and the woman [doctor] said, How far gone are you? And Keyleigh was like, What? And that was it. Thats how she found out she was pregnant. It had happened naturally, he says, without even the eggs being reinseminated. Cunningham beams joy and gratitude flickering across his face. And now I have a beautiful little nephew. Blake is 2 and healthy. I consider him a piece of me, says Cunningham. Because if my bone marrow helped her get better then hes the end product of that, in a way. Hes an angel. Although Keyleigh is still not back to full health and uses a wheelchair at times, she and Cunningham grasp every opportunity to be together. She loves music, so were constantly going to concerts together, he says. Were going to Vegas for my 21st birthday in November. Shes an inspiration for me. The sweep of her illness, and the timing of it, transformed their relationship, he says. Its really weird: We were close as children, then fiery at each other as teenage girls [as we were] at the time but then seeing her ill flipped it for me, because I was just like, oh my god, thats my sister. It was really hard. So being able to transition has also made us grow closer. Shes gone through something, Ive gone through something, and weve come out the other end together. Theyre also now involved with the African-Caribbean Leukaemia Trust, which, among other activities, encourages people from ethnic minorities to join the bone marrow donor register. The bond between Cunningham and his sister, along with that with his girlfriend, seems crucial for him in withstanding some of the transphobia and racism in everyday life. Given such an intersection of race and gender, it might seem pertinent to ask Cunningham what he has noticed in the change in peoples perception of him, from being someone was once perceived to be a young black woman and now a young black man. But, he says, its impossible to isolate these factors into a before-and-after transition split. View this image  Cunningham and Keyleigh. Cunningham As a young female I was very angry, and before hormones I wasnt comfortable speaking to people, whereas now now Im so much more vocal with my opinions and Ive become a better person. So I feel like other people have seen that as well. Regardless of the fact Ive gone from one thing to another, they all know Im a better version of the person I was. But as an actor, brutal and sometimes discriminatory casting processes remain an issue. Ive been turned down for a role not that long ago because it was for a cis [non-trans] male part, says Cunningham, without divulging what the role was. My agent said, Well, he looks like a bloke, sounds like a bloke, walks like a bloke, so why cant he have the part? And they said, Because hes trans. Its ridiculous. Unless its a full-frontal nudity scene where I might not feel as comfortable, whats the problem? Cunningham wants to see more trans people enter the performing arts so there is a wider pool of acting talent from which casting agents can draw. It would be great too if there were more trans men on TV to give trans men who are transitioning someone to look up to, he says. Hopefully I can be a voice for some trans people and for people who dont know theyre trans yet, to help some people realise thats who they are. View this image  Matthew Tucker / BuzzFeed As he smiles again, an elbow bent around the top of the chair, bicep curling in, a picture of someone at ease with himself, the final question is unavoidable. What would Cunningham have thought aged 15, if he could have seen what his life would become? He stops for a moment a rare pause to allow himself to relive that time. I wouldnt have believed it.

aS"Jillian Weiss, a professor who also has been behind cutting-edge employment litigation on behalf of transgender people, will take the helm of the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund. View this image  courtesy of TLDEF Jillian Weiss, a professor and employment attorney who successfully sued companies like Saks & Co. and Deluxe Financial Services on behalf of trans people, has been appointed as the next executive director of the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund, BuzzFeed News learned exclusively today. Weiss will also be the first trans person to lead TLDEF, one of the countrys largest trans rights groups. Its founding director, Michael Silverman, a cisgender gay man with a long record of LGBT advocacy, has run the group since he started it in 2003 as one of the first legal organizations to focus on fighting for transgender rights. He decided to step down in April, leading to Weisss appointment. Its been heart-wrenching to be able to see all this discrimination against trans people and not be be able to help, Weiss told BuzzFeed News in a phone interview. Now I will be able to contribute in a much larger way, and from a standpoint where I can understand some of the things theyre going through. Weiss, who was a tenured professor at Ramapo College of New Jersey prior to her new appointment, has already done significant work to advance transgender employment protections through her private practice. Her most high-profile case to date involved a trans woman, Leyth Jamal, who sued the department store chain Saks & Co. The case led the company eventually to accept that anti-transgender discrimination is covered under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlaws discrimination based on sex. Jamals claim was eventually settled out of court. Weisss new role is more expansive as the organizations work involves legal cases involving health care, housing, public accommodations, identity, documents, prisons, and foster care among others. Theres an endless list of work that needs to be done, Weiss said. TLDEF has been instrumental in advancing the rights of trans people across the country through their legal work, having helped 1,400 people and received over 10,000 pro bono hours from its law firm partners in 2015 alone. Some of their past highest-profile cases include fighting to allow a transgender then-6-year-old Coy Mathis to use the girls bathroom in her Colorado school, which paved the way for similar cases in other states. The group also led the way in state identification-related cases in West Virginia and South Carolina. TLDEF is also known for its Name Change Project, which matches transgender people seeking legal name changes with pro bono lawyers to assist them. Jillian is a tremendous advocate for transgender equality with an extraordinary list of transgender rights accomplishments, Silverman told BuzzFeed News. She brings the exact qualities necessary to lead TLDEF into the next decade. Though Weisss identity gives her important insight into the difficulties of trans people, she is quick to point out that she comes from a position of privilege in a community whose members often have little to no access to education or employment. Its really the system that is set up to discriminate and to be prejudiced against trans people, particularly people of color, and other people caught at the intersection of different kinds of prejudice, like race and class and gender, Weiss concluded. Its very important that we focus on that intersection and understand that its a much larger picture out there. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .

View this image  Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant Mike Blake / Reuters WASHINGTON Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant has gone to a federal appeals court seeking authority for the state to enforce its recently passed anti-LGBT religious exemption law while he appeals a district court ruling halting enforcement of the law the day before it was due to go into effect. Bryant, in a July 7 filing by his general counsel, had asked that trial court judge U.S. District Court Judge Carlton Reeves to issue a stay of his ruling pending Bryants appeal of the ruling against the law, HB 1523. Having heard no response from Reeves, Bryant filed a request with the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday evening asking the appeals court to issue a stay of Reeves ruling. In addition to his general counsel, Bryant a Republican on Monday evening also was represented by a lawyer from the Alliance Defending Freedom and lawyers from a small St. Louis, Missouri, law firm known for its representation of conservative causes, James Otis Law Group. Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood a Democrat has not yet announced if he will appeal of Reeves preliminary injunction, but he expressed doubts about whether he thought an appeal was appropriate.

aS'Even before Buddy Fishers Airbnb reservation was canceled by an anti-gay host, LGBT travelers were asking Airbnb to offer a gay-friendly booking option. This August will not be the first time Houston resident Buddy Fisher attends Austin Pride hes been many times before. But it might have been his first time staying in an Airbnb during the event, had his reservation not been canceled by an anti-gay host an unpleasant episode of discrimination that some say Fisher could have been spared if Airbnb allowed travelers to filter search results via an LGBT-friendly option. I wrote, Im in town for the Austin pride events, Fisher told BuzzFeed News. The booking started to go through. About an hour after, I get a message from Airbnb saying my reservation was canceled. Then, a few moments after that, I get a message through their private messenger system on the application saying, No LGBT people please. I do not support people who are against humanity. View this image  Buddy Fisher / Via kvue.com As a gay man living in Texas, Fisher said hes never been exposed to the kind of blunt discrimination he experienced on Airbnb. Ive been quite lucky with my friends and family. I really havent had overt discrimination against me. Theres been little jabs here and there, but Ive never been turned away directly because I was gay, he said. It surprised the heck out of me, and it was devastating. It hurt. Fisher had never booked a room on Airbnb before, but he did have friends who worked for the company. Through them he reported what had happened, and he quickly received an apology. Airbnb reached out to me and apologized. The company said it has a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to discrimination like this, Fisher said. They said they had blocked the person from their website. The companys response satisfied Fisher, who said it was appropriate. But removing discriminatory hosts retroactively no matter how quickly wont prevent the same kind of abuse from happening to someone else. This could happen again, Fisher said. If I was taking my boyfriend with me, and that guy was anti-LGBT, and he sees that its me and my boyfriend, and he approves our rental, and lets us stay there whos to say that he might come in with a gun and kill us after we are asleep? Its a little scary. Something like that could potentially happen. Airbnb repeatedly told BuzzFeed News that the company is undergoing an internal review of its platform, with a focus on issues of discrimination that have been raised over the last few months. Were currently examining a range of ideas and look forward to announcing our next steps as the summer winds down, a company spokesperson said in a statement. But some LGBT Airbnb customers have been lobbying the company for a feature that might have prevented the discrimination encountered by Fisher and others. When will AirBnB get a gay-friendly option for hosts? It\'s weird having to come out every time. "Yes, one bed, really." An LGBT-friendly checkbox, some say, would give hosts a way to make LGBT travelers feel welcome, and would give LGBT travelers especially those traveling with a same-sex partner a sense of comfort and security. I just feel that until we do live in an accepting society we need some sort of a way of knowing that hosts are welcoming to members of the LGBT community, said Anna Bailey-Bearfield, one of multiple people who have reached out to Airbnb on Twitter asking about the lack of an LGBT-friendly option. It is just about ensuring safety. This would enable us to choose to stay in places that accept us rather than having to worry or potentially face hatred during what should be a positive experience. Sophie Wilkinson is another traveler who says she and her girlfriend would feel more safe using Airbnb to travel if they could search listings of explicitly LGBT-friendly hosts. Wilkinson notes that the pair spend a fair bit of time sleuthing online, trying to figure out if potential hosts are LGBT-friendly. @VivekNotalive thanks! When will @Airbnb make it possible for hosts to check a \'gay friendly\' box, it would help ensure me & my gf feel safe Though its not clear whether Airbnb is considering adding an LGBT-friendly option at this time, the company told BuzzFeed News it will welcome ideas from anyone who shares our commitment to creating a community that is fair for everyone. One gay traveler who tweeted at Airbnb asking for a gay-friendly option, Andres Almeida, was happy to hear about the companys internal review. Id like to know how many guests have ever been turned down for traveling as an out queer person or couple, he told BuzzFeed News via email. Airbnb has been very vocal about its support for LGBT rights. During recent pride holidays, the company published multiple ads touting its support for the LGBT community as part of its #HostWithPride campaign. youtube.com However, at no point during the host registration process are new hosts asked to read Airbnbs anti-discrimination policy. The sign-up process for hosts involves many steps, including selecting what kind of property is being listed (apartment? Yurt? Treehouse? Villa?) and what kind of amenities are available (breakfast? Hot tub? Hair dryer?), and an acknowledgement of local laws and regulations regarding short-term rentals. But Airbnb doesnt do a great job of telling hosts that rejecting guests based on their sexual orientation or race is discriminatory and grounds for being permanently removed from the site. That information is buried in clause 14 of the companys 32,000-word Terms of Service, which hosts have to click through to read during the sign-up process. And even then, hosts are just reading some legalese about liability for posting discriminatory messages, not Airbnbs full discrimination policy, which requires even more clicking to locate. Stefan Arestis and Sebastien Chaneac, who run a gay travel site called Nomadic Boys, were among those who noted the contradiction between Airbnbs pro-gay public relations campaign and the experience that some gay travelers have had in trying to use the site. In June, the duo tweeted at the company, asking if its public support of pride meant that an LGBT-friendly checkbox was coming soon. Heres the exchange that ensued: @nomadicboys Hi Nomadic Boys We believe in a world where we all belong anywhere, thanks for your comments and enjoy your world trip! @nomadicboys Hi Nomadic Boys! Airbnb has a strong antidiscrimination policy and therefore, LGBT community is welcome in every Airbnb listing @nomadicboys We don\'t tolerate any discriminatory behaviour and, in this case, we suggest to report it to us immediately. Thanks @AirbnbHelp thx guys. But wouldn\'t it be easier if you had an option to search for gay friendly listings in the first place b4 issues arise? In a follow-up email conversation, Arestis said Airbnbs response to his concern on Twitter missed the point. In countries where being gay is illegal and society really frowns on us (like India, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, etc.) this is particularly important to be able to check, Arestis said. They say they dont tolerate discrimination in any way and hosts are open-minded. This is all fine, but if were searching for a host to stay with in, say, Kuala Lumpur, we genuinely have no idea if we have to pretend to be mates around them or if they are OK with us being a gay couple. While Airbnb insists addressing discrimination on its platform is a priority right now, the companys policies to date seem largely aspirational, designed for a more idealistic world than the one we actually live in. Airbnb says its working on making its stance on discrimination easier to understand and more visible to hosts. But that effort comes too late for people like Buddy Fisher, Shadi Petosky, or the two men who were kicked out of their Airbnb lodgings in Galveston when the host realized they were a couple. Buddy Fisher, for his part, said hed be willing to give Airbnb another go. But he also felt the company could take more deliberate steps to keep LGBT travelers safe. When youre looking for an apartment or hotel, you have all kinds of different boxes you can check, mark preferences, Fisher said. If Airbnb put something like that on there, that could help.

aS"In an exclusive interview, BuzzFeed News spoke with Alaina Kupec, a trans woman from North Carolina who is featured in the 60-second ad targeting anti-trans legislation. View this image  The ad is part of a larger public education campaign by Fairness USA, a partnership composed of the Freedom for All Americans Education Fund, the Movement Advancement Project (MAP), the National Center for Transgender Equality, and the Equality Ohio Education Fund. The groups intend to highlight the current lack of state and federal nondiscrimination protections for transgender people in the United States. North Carolinas HB2, which requires transgender people to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender listed on their birth certificate, is only one of several anti-LGBT bills currently at the heart of national controversy. It really has been emotionally crushing, Kupec told BuzzFeed News of her personal reaction to North Carolinas legislation. To live with the specter of HB2 these past several months is so personally disappointing. At their core, laws like this really deny the existence of transgender people. View this image  fairnessusa.org fairnessusa.org After the passing of HB2 in March, Kupec could no longer sit by and watch what was happening in her home state of North Carolina without taking action. She would soon appear in a video put together by the Raleigh Observer depicting what its like to be living as a trans person under HB2. It was from this video that Kupec was cast to appear in the Fairness USA ad. Kupec hopes that people who watch the spot on Thursday realize that transgender people are just regular people. The fictional man in the dress is just that. Its a political boogie man used to further a political agenda at the expense of a very fragile community, she said. Thats the saddest part of all of this, the effects of this legislation on trans youth, not only in the U.S., but across the world. Its marginalizing an already marginalized community. View this image  Everyday someone is being harassed or assaulted in a restroom, Keisling said. Were going to educate people. We want people to understand that trans people are typical people going about their day sometimes that means you have to use the bathroom. If you cant use the bathroom at work, you cant work. If you cant use the bathroom at school, you cant be a student. In conjunction with the ad, the National Center for Trans Equality announced the upcoming release of an extensive data report, sourced from a larger survey of transgender people, that the group says will demonstrate how anti-trans laws effect trans peoples lives.

aS"But HIV is still an enormous challenge. View this image  China Photos / Getty Images HIV and AIDS organisations and researchers have called on the nation to work together to end HIV as they celebrate the extraordinary progress in eliminating AIDS as a threat to public health. The number of people dying from AIDS has reduced from 1000 per year in the peak of the epidemic in the early 1990s to a figure so low, it is not even recorded. The AIDS public health threat has morphed into an HIV prevention challenge, said Professor Andrew Grulich, head of the HIV Epidemiology and Prevention Program at the Kirby Institute, Australias peak HIV research body. Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations CEO Darryl ODonnell told BuzzFeed News the condition people have so long feared is no longer seen in Australia in the way it is remembered from the 80s and 90s. People diagnosed with HIV can live a full and healthy life, with a normal life expectancy, he said. HIV is still an incredibly serious illness, and theres no easy road for it. But it is not a death sentence. HIV is a chronic but manageable virus that attacks the immune system, while AIDS is a condition that can follow on from untreated HIV. There are 1100 new diagnoses of HIV in Australia each year. The alternative is that a large number of people continue to hold on to outdated understandings of HIV and AIDS. It brings a lot of stigma, a lot of shame. Its not like that now, he said. Were very comfortable with the community updating the public of where HIV and AIDS are up to in Australia.

Cipri Martinez, President of the National Association of People Living with HIV Australia, said the virtual elimination of AIDS cases in Australia is an important milestone, but a crucial element to ending HIV in Australia is to encourage the uptake of antiretroviral medicine so that HIV positive people can become undetectable and uninfectious to others.

aS"A second multi-state lawsuit challenging the Obama administrations moves, particularly in support of transgender students. View this image  Mandel Ngan / AFP / Getty Images WASHINGTON Nebraska, joined by nine other states, filed a federal lawsuit on Friday seeking to halt implementation and enforcement of the Obama administrations policies providing transgender protections under current law. The new lawsuit echoes a lawsuit filed in May by several other states, led by Texas. The Nebraska-led lawsuit contains many of the same claims raised in the Texas-led lawsuit, often repeating the same exact language as appeared in the Texas complaint. Despite naming the same defendants as in the Texas-led lawsuit, however, the Nebraska-led lawsuit appears to focus on protections relating to transgender students asserting that students have the right under federal law to use a restroom in accordance with their gender identity. Nonetheless, it does name the Education, Justice, and Labor departments, as well as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, as defendants and asks for relief against all of those agencies transgender-inclusive policies. Nebraskas attorney general, Douglas Peterson, is joined in the suit against the Obama administration by the attorneys general of Arkansas, Kansas, Michigan, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Wyoming. The lawsuit has been assigned to be heard by U.S. District Court Judge John Gerrard, nominated to the bench by President Obama in 2012. Gerrard previously had served as a justice of the Nebraska Supreme Court. The complaint claims that the Obama administrations policies finding that existing sex discrimination protections include protections against gender identity-based discrimination were not implemented properly under the Administrative Procedure Act and, regardless of that, are substantively unlawful interpretations of existing law. The one argument advanced in the Texas-led lawsuit that is not found in Fridays filing led by Nebraska is a claim that the Obama administration policies violate the sovereign immunity of the states. Earlier this week, the 13 states involved in the Texas-led lawsuit filed a request in that case for the federal judge overseeing that case to issue a preliminary injunction halting enforcement of the policies in advance of the coming school year. Several lawsuits also are pending in North Carolina over the anti-transgender provision of HB 2, which prohibits people from using public restrooms that dont correspond to their birth certificates, effectively barring many transgender people from using the restroom that corresponds with their gender identity. Gov. Pat McCrory is defending the law and has filed a lawsuit against the Obama administration over its opposition to the laws provision. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!   by Sarah A.

aS'Out actor George Takei, who originally played Lt. Sulu, called the creative decision to make the character gay in Star Trek Beyond really unfortunate, prompting strong responses from Beyond screenwriter and actor Simon Pegg and out actor Zachary Quinto. View this image  View this image  [It] is where I hope we are going as a species, to not politicize ones personal orientations, he added. View this image  The actor who has been with his husband Brad Takei (n Altman) for 29 years explained that Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry, who Takei said was a strong supporter of LGBT equality, had conceived of Sulu as a heterosexual character. And despite the fact that Sulu never had a female romantic or sexual partner throughout the original TV series and Star Trek movies, Takei felt Star Trek Beyond director Justin Lin and screenwriters Simon Pegg and Doug Jung should honor Roddenberrys choice, especially given the franchises 50th anniversary. View this image  Takei said he was left to believe that his wishes were heeded, especially after receiving a supportive email from Pegg. But he said an email from Cho last week made clear the filmmakers had moved forward with their plans. Im delighted that theres a gay character, Takei told THR. Unfortunately, its a twisting of Genes creation, to which he put in so much thought. I think its really unfortunate. View this image  I have huge love and respect for George Takei, his heart, courage and humour are an inspiration, said Pegg in the statement (which you can read in full at the bottom of this post). However, with regards to his thoughts on our Sulu, I must respectfully disagree with him. Hes right, it is unfortunate, its unfortunate that the screen version of the most inclusive, tolerant universe in science fiction hasnt featured an LGBT character until now, Pegg continued. We could have introduced a new gay character, but he or she would have been primarily defined by their sexuality, seen as the gay character, rather than simply for who they are, and isnt that tokenism? According to Pegg, the filmmaking team wanted their LGBT character to be someone the audience already knew as a human being, so that his sexuality would not be the characters defining characteristic. Pegg added that he believed Roddenberry would have explored Sulus sexuality with George during the run of the original series from 1966 to 1969, had the culture at the time been open minded enough to accept it. But Pegg also noted that, regardless of Roddenberrys intentions, Star Trek Beyond is part of an alternative timeline started by 2009s Star Trek directed by J.J. Abrams pointing to the sci-fi conceit that the Sulu played by Takei could still be heterosexual. Whatever magic ingredient determines our sexuality was different for Sulu in our timeline, said Pegg. I like this idea because it suggests that in a hypothetical multiverse, across an infinite matrix of alternate realities, we are all LGBT somewhere. I think any member of the LGBT community that takes issue with the normalized and positive portrayal of members of our community in Hollywood and in mainstream blockbuster cinema I get it that hes had his own personal journey and has his own personal relationship with this character, but, you know, as we established in the first Star Trek film in 2009, weve created an alternate universe, Quinto said, echoing Peggs statement. My hope is that eventually George can be strengthened by the enormously positive response from especially young people who are heartened by and inspired by this really tasteful and beautiful portrayal of something that I think is gaining acceptance and inclusion in our societies across the world, and should be. Paramount had no comment. Representatives for Cho and Lin did not respond to a request from BuzzFeed News for a further comment. I have huge love and respect for George Takei, his heart, courage and humour are an inspiration. However, with regards to his thoughts on our Sulu, I must respectfully disagree with him. Hes right, it is unfortunate, its unfortunate that the screen version of the most inclusive, tolerant universe in science fiction hasnt featured an LGBT character until now. We could have introduced a new gay character but he or she would have been primarily defined by their sexuality, seen as the gay character, rather than simply for who they are and isnt that tokenism? Justin Lin, Doug Jung, and I loved the idea of it being someone we already knew because the audience have a pre-existing opinion of that character as a human being, unaffected by any prejudice. Their sexual orientation is just one of many personal aspects, not the defining characteristic. Also, the audience would infer that there has been an LGBT presence in the Trek Universe from the beginning (at least in the Kelvin timeline), that a gay hero isnt something new or strange. Its also important to note that at no point do we suggest that our Sulu was ever closeted, why would he need to be? Its just hasnt come up before. I dont believe Gene Roddenberrys decision to make the prime timelines Enterprise crew straight was an artistic one, more a necessity of the time. Trek rightly gets a lot of love for featuring the first interracial kiss on US television but Platos Stepchildren was the lowest rated episode ever. The viewing audience werent open minded enough at the time and it must have forced Roddenberry to modulate his innovation. His mantra was always infinite diversity in infinite combinations. If he could have explored Sulus sexuality with George, he no doubt would have. Roddenberry was a visionary and a pioneer but we choose our battles carefully. Our Trek is an alternate timeline with alternate details. Whatever magic ingredient determines our sexuality was different for Sulu in our timeline. I like this idea because it suggests that in a hypothetical multiverse, across an infinite matrix of alternate realities, we are all LGBT somewhere. Whatever dimension we inhabit, we all just want to be loved by those we love*. I cant speak for every reality but that must surely true of this one. Live long and prosper.

aS"The British government has announced a series of radical reforms for transgender people. Another vital step towards achieving true equality. View this image  House of Commons British transgender people can look forward to a future where legally changing their gender will be easier, where official documents including passports will be less likely to ask a persons gender, and where more will be done to tackle bullying and harassment, the government announced on Thursday. In response to recommendations made six months ago by the House of Commons women and equalities committee, Nicky Morgan, the women and equalities minister, unveiled a raft of measures designed to tackle multiple inequalities for trans people. Morgan has confirmed: * The government will review the Gender Recognition Act 2004, which enables trans people to change the legal status of their sex but forces applicants to undergo intrusive questioning by a panel of experts before such a change is granted; * Being transgender will no longer be deemed a mental illness by any public body, in particular the National Health Service (NHS); * A review will be conducted into unnecessary demands for gender information on official documents. This will include passports. A government spokesperson told BuzzFeed News a whole range of options will be looked at so passports in particular can better and more easily reflect the gender of British citizens; * A major survey into the needs and experiences of trans people in Britain which will also seek to ascertain the numbers of trans people in the population will be undertaken so that various government departments can better meet their needs. This year will also see the British Social Attitudes Survey include questions about attitudes among the general population towards trans people; * NHS staff in gender identity services will receive more and improved training, to facilitate better treatment for transgender people; * The government will work with universities to combat transphobic bullying in higher education. getty parliamentlive.tv Nicky Morgan (left) and Caroline Dinenage Perhaps most radical among these measures will be the review of the Gender Recognition Act a move that is likely to bring the UK more in line with Ireland, Malta, and Denmark, which do not require trans people to undergo surgery and other radical medical interventions before they can legally change their gender. Although the government did not specifically outline what it expects the conclusion of the review will be, it is understood a self-declaration scheme or something similar is likely. Currently, trans people have to convince doctors and psychiatrists before documentation is changed. We must set the pace on this agenda and lead the way in better understanding and supporting our trans people, said Morgan. Thats why I am delighted to announce that we will be reviewing the Gender Recognition Act helping overturn an outdated system and ensure the transgender persons needs are at the heart of the process. Caroline Dinenage, minister for women, equalities, and family justice, added: By reviewing the legal process of changing your gender, rethinking when and why we collect gender information, and working with the transgender community to better understand the problems they face, we take another vital step towards achieving true equality for transgender people. The measures were welcomed by Paris Lees, Britains most prominent trans rights activist and journalist. She told BuzzFeed News: The Gender Recognition Act does need updating but thats not to do down the brilliant activists that worked for so many years to get that legislation in place. It has already started to look old-fashioned, and its important the government looks into the act most people in Britain find red tape and bureaucracy a nightmare to do anything, but you can multiply the difficulties by 10 if youre a trans person. View this image  Neil Dawson She explained: Just getting a bank account or registering to vote, everything is made that much harder because you have to send in more documents, or come in in person and, essentially, prove you are who you say you are. So anything we can do to reduce the hoops trans people are expected to jump through in order to get on with their lives is a good thing. A review of the need for gender information on official documents is particularly vital, said Lees, and could have wider-reaching, positive ramifications beyond the trans community. Radical feminists should be absolutely delighted and grateful to the trans community because theyve been going on about abolishing gender for decades and it looks like were finally making some headway with that, she said. We know that the more polarised gender is in a society the greater the violence women face. So anything we can do to lessen gender segregation is good for everybody, but in particular for women. Evidence gathering about both the needs and numbers of trans people, along with the attitudes they face from the wider public, is also crucial, said Lees. Its long overdue. Like every trans person Ive faced ignorance and stupidity when Ive been accessing services. We need to accept that society as a whole has been quite ignorant of this issue until now and its time we did something about it because trans people arent going anywhere.

aS"Hearing Chelseas voice after learning that she had attempted to take her life last week was incredibly emotional, Nancy Hollander, an attorney for Manning, said Monday. View this image  Chelsea Manning Reuters Chelsea Manning, a former soldier who is serving a 35-year prison sentence for violating the Espionage Act, remained under close observation Monday after attempting suicide last week, her attorney said. I am okay. I'm glad to be alive. Thank you all for your love <3 I will get through this. #standwithchelsea Nancy Hollander, the lead attorney on Mannings defense team, said in a statement to BuzzFeed News that she was finally able to speak with her client after more than a week of no access. Last week, Chelsea made a decision to end her life. Her attempt to take her own life was unsuccessful. She knows that people have questions about how she is doing and she wants everyone to know that she remains under close observation by the prison and expects to remain on this status for the next several weeks. For us, hearing Chelseas voice after learning that she had attempted to take her life last week was incredibly emotional. She is someone who has fought so hard for so many issues we care about and we are honored to fight for her freedom and medical care. Hollander had said on Friday that Army doctors had recommended against Manning accepting any calls. Manning had been serving out her sentence at the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, when she was taken to the hospital early Tuesday, according to CNN, which cited U.S. Army spokesman Colonel Patrick Seiber. Were shocked and outraged that an official at Leavenworth contacted the press with private confidential medical information about Chelsea Manning, yet no one at the Army has given a shred of information to her legal team, Hollander said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. The month after her July 2013 conviction for violating the Espionage Act and other laws in relation to leaking thousands of classified documents to WikiLeaks, Manning announced she would live the rest of her life as a woman. The Army eventually agreed to supply her with hormone transition therapy.    Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!  Tagged:chelsea manning, fort leavenworth, prison, wikileaks by Sarah A.

aS"Its like Kids Company. Luxury gifts and first-class travel for executives. Home Office grants spent in 24 hours. Warnings ignored by trustees and the Charity Commission. A BuzzFeed News investigation into the closure of Broken Rainbow. View this image  Rebecca Hendin / BuzzFeed Britains only national charity for LGBT victims of domestic abuse collapsed amid allegations of serious financial mismanagement and a failure of oversight by both its trustees and its biggest backer, the Home Office, BuzzFeed News can reveal. Broken Rainbow, which ran both a helpline and an advice service for LGBT people in abusive relationships, went into liquidation on 3 June, with the causes of the collapse unknown. But BuzzFeed News has now seen a huge cache of internal files including accounts, expenses claims, bank statements, and demands from unpaid creditors that reveal crucial new information about the charitys collapse. The documents, which were disclosed by a whistleblower, detail spending on first-class travel, expensive offices, and luxury gifts, even as the charitys CEO was being warned that it had only a few pounds in its account, or was even in the red. The leaked files show that:  Grants worth tens of thousands of pounds from major funders such as the Home Office and Comic Relief were spent within 24 hours of payment, often being used to cover running costs such as new computers and staff expenses;  A treasurer for the charity quit within weeks of being appointed, warning the board of trustees that restricted funds had been misspent, and that this could amount to illegal activity;  The charity spent more than 23,000 equivalent to the running costs of its helpline for six months, according to the whistleblower on travel expenses, mainly for the CEO;  The charity received repeated demands from HMRC for unpaid tax and national insurance from staff salaries;  While appealing for more funds, the charity spent lavishly on iMacs, iPads, 800 train tickets, bouquets of flowers, and catered lunches;  Thousands of pounds were spent on legal fees following a bullying allegation by a member of staff. Facebook / Broken Rainbow Facebook The revelations raise serious questions for Broken Rainbows trustees who were responsible for oversight of the charity but apparently failed to act on a number of warnings from staff, including the whistleblower. In a statement, the board of trustees denied negligence but said a comprehensive investigation into the operation of Broken Rainbow is both warranted and necessary. The statement added: Most of the issues identified by your source took place before any of the existing trustees were in post and we simply cannot comment on what we do not as yet know. The government is also now facing questions over what, if any, due diligence the Home Office carried out when it continued to pour public money into Broken Rainbow right up to its collapse. The Home Office has subsequently promised to continue funding the helpline but through Galop, another LGBT charity. The revelations come less than a year after the collapse of Kids Company, the charity to which the Cabinet Office controversially gave 3 million just days before its closure, amid multiple allegations of financial impropriety. View this image  Facebook / Broken Rainbow During interviews and in correspondence seen by BuzzFeed News, four Broken Rainbows employees separately made the same comparison between the charitys demise and the collapse of Kids Company. The Charity Commission told BuzzFeed News that following complaints made to it against Broken Rainbow the commission has opened a case to examine what regulatory action might be required. A Home Office spokesperson did not respond to detailed questions put by BuzzFeed News, but said: We will work with the Charities Commission to determine an appropriate course of action for investigating Broken Rainbows collapse. Further material obtained by BuzzFeed News including emails, legal letters, Facebook messages, and interviews with charity associates also shows how the organisation was beset by infighting, rapid staff turnover, and grievance claims. The most recent public sign of Broken Rainbows financial crisis came in April this year when BuzzFeed News reported that it was facing imminent closure, according to staff, unless it received 25,000 in the next 48 hours. The small charity, with a clutch of employees and a handful of volunteers, which was set up in 2002 and claimed to help 10,000 people a year, appeared to be on the brink. This was despite high-profile endorsement from a wealth of celebrity supporters including Sir Ian McKellen, Caroline Lucas, and Stephen Fry. But the whistleblower then emailed BuzzFeed News with a single line: Youre not being told the truth. He said the charity was already bust long before it closed and was in chaos. The accounts are a mess, he told BuzzFeed News. A text sent in April this year by CEO Jo Harvey Barringer appears to confirm that. It begins, We are in chaos here and ends with an admission that HMRC [Her Majestys Revenue and Customs] are chasing me for a tax payment on unpaid PAYE tax from staff salaries. This is the story of how Broken Rainbow went broke. View this image  Rebecca Hendin / BuzzFeed For the whistleblower, whom we will call Paul, there was one moment that crystallised his problem with the financial management of Broken Rainbow. When the charitys CEO, Jo Harvey Barringer, got married last year, the then chair of the board, Andrew Grant, sent her and her new wife a bouquet of flowers, costing 54.99, with a box of champagne truffles at 9.99 and put them through on expenses. With delivery charges, the gifts came to 74.97. The expense claim for the gift was then approved by its recipient. On his LinkedIn profile, Grant describes himself as a commercially astute leader. But this represents a tiny fraction of the charitys use of funds. Accounts seen by BuzzFeed News show that in 2015, while frequently leaving insufficient money in its bank account to pay staff redundancies in the event of its collapse, Broken Rainbow spent 23,446 (its entire income for 2015 was 177,565) on travel expenses, much of which was for the CEO. As a proportion of what they need in order to run thats a huge amount, said Paul. Thats the [running costs of] the helpline for six months. It also represents more than a quarter of the 90,000 the Home Office gave the charity last year to run the helpline. The Home Office was Broken Rainbows largest funder. These travel expenses comprise numerous first-class train tickets. On one occasion, on 17 September 2015, after a summer in which the charity went into the red on several occasions, Harvey Barringer booked a first-class train ticket from London to Edinburgh and charged the charity 510.10. Broken Rainbows offices are in London and Manchester. It was not a one-off. That July, she had travelled the same route first-class for 356.10, and again just three weeks later, this time at a cost of 442.50. But this was less than the month before June 2015 when Harvey Barringer took the same journey and put the first-class fare through on expenses. It cost 805.50. She had already charged the charity 2,440.95 that month on several other train tickets to Edinburgh. Broken Rainbow Facebook Jo Harvey Barringer In two weeks, from late October to early November 2015, Harvey Barringer charged another 2,780.50 to the charity in train fares to Edinburgh. The whistleblower sent her a text on 12 November. It pointed out that the charity had 6 whole British pounds left. Catered lunches were also routine at Broken Rainbow, the accounts show. At a seminar in February 2015, 14 attendees were treated to goats cheese tarts, Parma ham wraps, gravadlax on rye bread, red snapper, and tandoori chicken at a price of 332.50. By 5 March 2015, there was just 61.48 in the bank. Later that month, a staff meeting cost the charity 5.10 on bananas alone. Another 25 went on a fruit platter. Meals out were not uncommon, according to the receipts with the expense claims. They feature one item more regularly than any others: Peroni beers. Two dinners, together priced 83.93, were held at restaurants in Brighton, nowhere near either the London or Manchester office, but not far from the CEOs home. Other claims included lunches and dinners at Ask, TGI Fridays, Eds Diner, Pizza Express, and All Bar One. Many of the food receipts are for trivial amounts, but all were signed off despite the charity having almost no funds left. In September last year, for example, Haribo sweets were delivered to the Broken Rainbow office in Manchester through an office supplies company, costing 7.20. On 30 September, the whistleblower sent Harvey Barringer another text. It said: 40p in the bank. Facebook Facebook Much more significant amounts were spent on office space. Until last year, Broken Rainbow operated from an office in London that cost around 400 per month, and then, according to whistleblower Paul, the main office was transferred to Manchester. But for the first few months afterwards, Broken Rainbow operated from a serviced office, which cost between 1,800 and 2,500 per month, depending on what services they used. Sometimes this included a laundry service. The charity then signed a lease last October with another serviced office (546 sq ft) in the city centre at a cost of 1,447 a month, or 17,366 per year. We all know serviced offices are not value for money, said Paul. Meeting rooms were hired in London, along with data projectors at a cost of 300 per day. There were gifts not only for the CEO. One expense form from April 2015 charged 12.50 to the charity for Marks and Spencer flowers for Julies Bday. A former trustee who wrote to BuzzFeed News said that she too received flowers on her wedding day. And a further expense claim of 2.99 for an employee birthday card was found in the paperwork. Some of the expenses were considerably more unusual: two lots of Pantene conditioner (1.97 each), Gillette razor blades at 8, Sure deodorant (1.63), and a memory foam cushion, last July, costing 83.98. A significant amount also went on paying Jo Harvey Barringer, who until late last year was on an hourly rate of 25. According to her invoices, on one day she worked for 19 hours, costing the charity 475. In October 2015, she was paid 5,362 all on an hourly rate. In June last year, a charitable foundation called Esmee Fairbairn agreed to a 30,000-per-year grant towards Harvey Barringers salary. The grant offer reveals that Harvey Barringer detailed three key outcomes for success at the charity, the last of which was greater financial sustainability. The month the grant arrived there was less than 300 in Broken Rainbows account. Facebook Facebook Harvey Barringer was paid a bonus of 7,500 in April 2015, the accounts show. This, according to Paul, was for the way shed stopped the organisation going under. Within months, costs would rise. A member of staff accused Harvey Barringer of bullying. According to Paul, it was verbal and intimidation. They suspended her [Barringer]. Full payI had lots of phone calls with Jo [about it]. Broken Rainbow then spent 9,120 on legal advice from an employment lawyer. After the lawyer concluded that there was no case to answer, Harvey Barringer returned to her position. Shortly after, an email from the board of trustees to staff said, We are reviewing our code of conduct and added, We need to make sure we talk to each other in a way that reflects the aims and values of our organisation. The employee who alleged bullying Wendy Wilde did so in an email to the board of trustees on 28 July 2015. Seen by BuzzFeed News, it contains the accusation of a culture of fear and intimidation at the domestic abuse organisation. Wilde also told BuzzFeed News that she and another former staff member reported Broken Rainbow to the Charity Commission, alleging bullying and financial misconduct, and attached her resignation letter, which alleges the charity was being run for personal gain. Wilde said she received only a confirmation of her email, with no further correspondence from the Charity Commission. The other member of staff did receive a response from the commission, however five months later. I recommended the Charity Commission look over the bank account [of Broken Rainbow], Wilde told BuzzFeed News. Because one of the things I repeatedly said to the board was, You need to check your bank account. Just having accounts prepared for you by Jo [Harvey Barringer] is not enough. For Wilde, one memory stands out as a turning point for her resignation. A group of schoolchildren all brought in a penny and sent us in that money, she said. It wasnt much but all those kids got that money together. Wilde then watched as, she said, funds went on first-class train tickets. Wilde insists that the blame for Broken Rainbows problems lies with the board as well as with Harvey Barringer, as the trustees didnt really understand what they were doing. Another former staff member, Emma Baldry, told BuzzFeed News both CEO and board were at fault, while a former trustee alleged that most of the failures were due to her fellow trustees. Facebook Facebook Broken Rainbows Rainbow dot campaign BuzzFeed News asked a former chair of the board of trustees, John Munro, whether the board should not have merely taken Harvey Barringers word about the accounts but instead investigated when the whistleblower warned them. He replied: I think that is a charge that could be perfectly reasonably levied. For Baldry, and for Wilde, what they witnessed at the charity called to mind one thing. Its Kids Company, said Wilde. When all the news came out about Kids Company I was like, I really hope this is going to be said about Broken Rainbow as well. From the documents seen by BuzzFeed News, Harvey Barringers management of the charitys finances is perhaps most starkly illustrated in two texts she sent to Paul on 26 November 2015. It was the day a grant arrived from Comic Relief: Comic relief has gone in can [you] load up salary payments including the two invoices for Jasna. Eleven minutes later she texted: And dont forget to take 250 from me for you either. Paul said he had lent Harvey Barringer 250, a personal loan, and therefore her texts appeared to be an instruction to take back the money from what was now in Broken Rainbows account money that had come from Comic Relief. There is no indication from the accounts nor any suggestion that Paul took 250 from the Broken Rainbow account, despite apparently having permission to do so. The charity spent grants from both Comic Relief and the Home Office at a considerable speed. On 28 January 2016, the quarterly 30,000 grant from the Home Office arrived in Broken Rainbows bank account. The charity was already 7,730.83 in the red so immediately there was only 22,269.17 left, but later that same day it was all gone. It was back in the red by 689. The grant was meant to keep the helpline going for months. But this was the modus operandi grants to fund the service for months evaporated within hours. Comic Relief gave Broken Rainbow 17,331 on 26 November 2015. By the next day it was all spent. 6,293.50 had gone to Harvey Barringer, despite half of her salary being paid by the Esmee Fairbairn foundation. Six months earlier, on 20 May 2015, 21,000 arrived from Comic Relief. Harvey Barringer, that same day, bought herself the new iMac computer, at a cost of 1,049. She charged 3,550.11 in expenses for that month. The entire grant was spent within a week.  View this image  Facebook This was only three weeks after 30,000 had come from the Home Office. The day the money arrived Harvey Barringer claimed 6,179.95 in salary, plus she received the 7,500 bonus already mentioned. Nearly half of the government grant, therefore, went to the CEO on the day it hit the charitys bank account. Within 48 hours, Broken Rainbow was 1,306.79 in debt. When the 30,000 grant from the Esmee Fairbairn foundation arrived on 8 June 2015 it marked a lucrative month for Harvey Barringer. It was supposed to last a year, but according to the accounts, by 1 July Broken Rainbow had 439 in the bank. In total, in June 2015, 14,331.58 was paid to Harvey Barringer. Last summer, Manchester City Council started pursuing Broken Rainbow for overdue business rates. By September 2015, the charity owed 3,000, with the council threatening debt recovery action. Several times last year there were insufficient funds in Broken Rainbows accounts to pay staff; many were paid late. (And in June 2016, one staff member told BuzzFeed News that she still hadnt been paid for the month of May). Throughout last year, Broken Rainbow was becoming used to warning letters arriving from a range of commercial and public organisations, chasing the charity for unpaid invoices, sometimes for pitiful amounts. In March 2015, with funds almost gone, the charity stopped various direct debits. One of them was to Windsor Telecom, a business phone company, which wrote to Broken Rainbow asking for just 69.68. View this image  Broken Rainbow / Companies House This was small fry compared with what Broken Rainbow had failed to pay HM Revenue and Customs. As far back as December 2014, HMRC was sending letters to the charity asking where the PAYE and National Insurance contributions from staff salaries were. That month, despite previous letters, HRMC demanded 6,577.09 in outstanding payments. Two months later, in February 2015, there was another demand, for 3,330.93. And two months after that another letter arrived from HMRC, asking for 2,233.50 and warning: We can enforce debts by visiting your premises and arranging for your goods to be seized and sold at public auction. Broken Rainbow was also being threatened with legal action by Companies House, which wrote to the charity in March last year warning the charity about its overdue accounts as those that had been submitted were rejected as unacceptable for filing. The letter informed Broken Rainbow that Failure to file accounts and annual returns within the statutory times allowed is a criminal offence, but that Companies House would defer any prosecution for 28 days, adding that if the company record is not brought up to date by that time, the directors will face criminal proceedings. In any case, the letter advised, as the accounts are already late a civil late filing penalty will automatically be incurred. In March 2016 a year later another letter arrived about the missing accounts, with a more serious threat: Unless cause is shown to the contrary, at the expiration of 3 months from the above date [1/3/16] the name of Broken Rainbow LGBT Domestic Violence Service (UK) will be struck off the register and the company will be dissolved. Yet, despite the many warning signs, the government continued to hand more public money to the charity. The following month, Broken Rainbow complained to the press that the promised Home Office grant was late and that it would close if the money didnt arrive swiftly. View this image  Facebook Within 24 hours, the grant was paid. Broken Rainbow sent out a press release confirming this. Harvey Barringer also confirmed the news on the charitys Facebook page, in a message that ended: We continue to need donations to ensure we build up our reserves and never find ourselves in the position again. So please keep donating. A month later, a new treasurer of Broken Rainbow, who had been in his post for only a few weeks, resigned. In his resignation email, seen by BuzzFeed News, he outlined his concerns to the board. These included that Harvey Barringer, who is incompetent in all matters relating to finance, made it impossible to submit the accounts due to a lack of information, documentation and willingness to cooperate. He added: Things have come to light off the back of these accounts which concern me deeply and I advise you all, as remaining members of the Board to urgently look into these which at best are obvious failures in governance and controls and at worst illegal activity. Hide Click to reveal View this image  Broken Rainbow These potential illegalities, he wrote, comprised the misspending of restricted funds that grants from the Home Office that were meant for the helpline were in fact spent on other things. The fact that the 2015 accounts shows this and Jo can not prove that this did not happen is most alarming. If the accounts are submitted showing this, there will no doubt be an investigation from the Home Office and if the accounts are not submitted at all, there will be an investigation and possible prosecutions by Companies House. He further accused Harvey Barringer of saying, Its fine not to reconcile the restricted fund completely. The treasurer explained in the letter that this was plainly wrong, and This is the reason why Kids Company was so publicly struck off last year and should act as a warning to all charities. He also claimed that expenses were paid to Harvey Barringer without any approval. What has most concerned whistleblower Paul, however, has been what he claims is the inaction of the Home Office. They have done no due diligence, he said. There was a Home Office audit of Broken Rainbow in 2014, but, said Paul, it did not look at the overall solvency of the charity. It didnt really go into the numbers, he said. Since the collapse of Broken Rainbow, the Home Office has agreed to continue funding the helpline, which will now be run by Galop, an anti-hate-crime charity for LGBT people, which had also been giving grants to Broken Rainbow. Questions now remain about both governance and funders, about why public money and donations from other charities continued to be pumped into Broken Rainbow, despite clear signs that it was in trouble. Paul, the whistleblower, tried to warn those within the charity of the dire situation in which they continued to operate. He emailed the then head of the board of trustees, John Munro, on 5 February 2016: The agency is essentially trading insolvent, which means that not only is that a legal issue for the trustees, they are also now personally liable for any bills, redundancy payments etc. According to Paul, his warnings had no effect. John Munro told BuzzFeed News: He [Paul] did raise concerns over the viability of the charity, which was contrary to the position that had been reported to the board. Munro said he raised Pauls email with the CEO but was told the information wasnt accurate, and added: I believe that we may have been given misinformation. Munro said: I couldnt investigate it myself because I did not have access to any of our online banking systems. With regards to the board of trustees, he said that none of us are experts but that the board did everything they believed was reasonable to make sure this charity was being run in the best possible way. Facebook In February 2016, Paul, the whistleblower, also reported Broken Rainbow to the Charity Commission for financial misconduct, but, he said, did not receive a reply the commission told BuzzFeed News it did not receive his letter. Paul alerted Munro again, in April, in an email also seen by BuzzFeed News: I was made aware yesterday about BRUK potentially going bust. I cannot stress enough how dangerous it is that you are trading in this way. Both Companies House and the Charity Commission have strict legal and regulatory requirements for the board to comply with or be personally liable. Munro told BuzzFeed News he could not remember this email. The board knew there was no money in the account, Paul told BuzzFeed News. Two chairs of the board have resigned this year, with a third (Robert Brown) taking over in May. Brown told BuzzFeed News he sacked Harvey Barringer before the charitys closure. Paul added, regarding Harvey Barringer, I told Jo [the charity was broke] on many occasions and she said, Oh yes, yes, but this money is coming in. On 2 June 2016, the money stopped coming in, and four days later staff were clearing out the offices of a failed, defunct charity the only one of its kind, and the only one some of Britains most vulnerable LGBT people turn to when they are most in danger. Broken Rainbow, along with other agencies, helped saved my life, Gordon Mundie, a former service user, told BuzzFeed News. Now, only the helpline remains, and without the extra services, more victims of abuse will be at risk. Why hasnt the Charity Commission investigated? Why did the Home Office keep funding it and refuse to step in? Who, in the end, is going to take responsibility? View this image  Rebecca Hendin A Home Office spokesperson told BuzzFeed News: We will work with the Charities Commission to determine an appropriate course of action for investigating Broken Rainbows collapse. In a statement, a legal representative for Jo Harvey Barringer wrote: Our client strongly rejects any suggestion that she was over-paid as CEO, that she mis-appropriated funds or that she has mis-managed the finances of the charity. On the contrary our client has worked tirelessly in the face of constant funding pressures and ensured that Broken Rainbow could continue to operate for many years. The board of trustees also released a statement to BuzzFeed News that denies any wrongdoing but says a comprehensive investigation into the operation of Broken Rainbow is both warranted and necessary and that We are confident that at the conclusion of the investigation it will be shown that the Board of Trustees have not been negligent in their duties. In response to specific points, the board added that: gifts for staff help motivate them and a small amount of unrestricted funds were available for this purpose; the CEO was responsible for operational expenditure and that no issues were raised through the organisations whistleblowing procedure; first-class travel was justified in the event of physical limitation of a staff or board member; taxis were appropriate for carrying equipment; it was a mistake not to set an upper limit on the daily pay of Harvey Barringer; the previous board authorised a bonus for Harvey Barringer; and the investigation into bullying concluded there was no case to answer. And in a statement to BuzzFeed News, the Charity Commission said: The Commission received a complaint last year about the governance of the charity and alleged unauthorised payment of trustees. The Commission opened a case and wrote to the charity in order to seek clarity on these issues. In June this year, a further complaint was made to the Commission. The Commission is now also assessing these more serious concerns in order to determine whether there is evidence to support them and what regulatory action may be required. The Commissions case is ongoing. The Commission has not been able to trace two complaints which are said to have been submitted to the Commission. We urge those who have attempted to contact the Commission to resubmit their concerns and any relevant evidence. It is not the Commissions policy [to] provide regular updates or ongoing commentary to all complainants. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS'We decided to do an action during the parade because Pride itself is political. View this image  Although their actions and demands have proved controversial to some, they didnt come out of nowhere, and the annual Pride festival is no stranger to protest. Heres how it all went down. View this image  View this image  From disrupting police board meetings to camping outside of Toronto police headquarters for two weeks, BLM has been making headlines since its inception. Daily Xtra, a Canadian LGBT news publication, even named them Torontos most effective LGBT movement. Given their successful track record of activism, it should come as no surprise that BLM planned to make use of their platform at Pride. When we were thinking about the issues that we may want to bring forward for the Pride parade, we started talking to different black LGBT community groups, some that participate in Pride and some that dont, LeRoi Newbold, a BLM spokesperson told BuzzFeed Canada. View on Instagram Blockorama is Prides longest-running showcase and is presented by the group Blackness Yes!. However, organizers say theyve had to fight for both stage location and accessibility accommodations. They also say theyre well overdue for a funding increase. Another group, Black Queer Youth, has also faced issues, said Newbold. These events are vital, said Newbold, because a lot of black youth may not be connected to any other black queer community spaces. Then theres the cops. The atmosphere of Pride [isnt] very inviting to black queer and trans community members due to the massive police presence, added Newbold. While these issues did come up in dialogue between BLM and Pride, they started planning for the day of the big parade. View this image  View this image  Apparently to some, our demands are "too radical/divisive." Look for yourselves fam #BlackPride View this image  Indeed, trans women of colour such as Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera helped make history during the Stonewall Riots of 1969. Its disruption like theirs that carved out and created that space for Pride, said Newbold. Pride does have roots that are political, so we wanted to bring it back to that place. View this image  Newbold said Chantelois appeared cheerful as he signed, smiling and hugging BLM members. At the time, Chantelois told the Toronto Star the demands were reasonable and made a lot of sense. View this image  #MyPrideIncludesPolice @TorontoPolice @BLM_TO @PrideToronto Obviously this is not an unexpected tactic from Black Lives Matter, Mike McCormack told BuzzFeed Canada. Were disappointed that the organizers of Pride accepted or signed a document that would have such inflammatory content, saying that police floats and participation in the future should not be allowed. He also said it has left LGBT officers feeling betrayed and that Pride allowed BLM to hijack the parade. McCormack said he understands if Chantelois wanted to get the parade moving, but he also wants the organization to apologize. A simple apology will correct the record and thats what were waiting for, he said. View this image  Police officers are significantly represented in the LGBTQ community and it would be unacceptable to alienate and discriminate against them and those who support them, Krangle wrote in the letter published by CBC News. They too struggled to gain a place and workplace free from discrimination and bias. View this image  View this image  Frankly, Black Lives Matter is not going to tell us that there is no more floats anymore in the parade, he told CP24. Yesterday, we agreed to have a conversation about this. We agreed that we will bring this to the community and to the membership, but at the end of the day, if my membership says no way, we want to have floats, they decide. He was even more blunt with the Star, saying, What I did yesterday was made the parade move. View this image  But, they added, Chantelois comments also dont come as a surprise. Pride Toronto has faced controversy before, and they surely will again. In the meantime, Newbold said BLM will do what it can make sure Pride commits to supporting queer and trans black folks. We will be continuing to work to ensure that our demands are followed through and taken seriously. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"In the days after the Pulse massacre, performers in Orlandos LGBT club scene were recovering from trauma and mourning their friends. But because people have flocked to Orlandos other gay bars, and because the rent needs to get paid, LGBT nightlife staffers have had to work through their pain in public not to mention the emotional labor involved in being the face of a national tragedy. Heres how theyre coping: in stolen, private moments among the queer families that love them. This past Saturday, hundreds of people poured into Robarts Arena in Sarasota, Florida, to say goodbye to Edward Sotomayor Jr. but a week earlier, his memory was celebrated in a quieter way, by the queer family with whom he was his truest self. The 34-year-old Sarasota native of Puerto Rican descent is perhaps the most recognizable of the 49 people killed in the Pulse shooting in Orlando on June 12. He was the first victim to be identified, his photograph shared thousands of times across social and news media in the frenzied hours after the massacre, and for many days that followed. Inside a nondescript beige house at the end of a cul-de-sac, 15 minutes from downtown Orlando, about a dozen people gathered to say their goodbyes. This was a private memorial for Eddie as his friends called him not with blood relatives, but the friends in the community hed been closest to, who considered themselves part of his chosen family. It was the first time they all gathered together since the shooting. Among the small group of Eddies queer relatives, including some Pulse employees, were friends who had known the victim for over a decade, and had flown from other parts of the country to attend. Pulses entertainment manager, Neema Bahrami, a lightly bearded man of Persian descent in his mid-thirties, was their doting host. He had survived the massacre and helped authorities get people out, but his best friend hadnt been able to escape. Neema called Eddie his baby and his son, even though they were practically the same age. In Eddies queer family, parenthood transcends age and gender. He and others were known to call Neema Momma because of his caring demeanor and his tendency to adopt and mentor younger queer people. And if Eddies queer family counted Neema as their parent, then Pulse was that familys home. View this image  The widely circulated photo of Edward Sotomayor Jr. Via Facebook: profile.php For many queer people, gay bars and clubs function as homes sanctuaries tucked away from an oftentimes unforgiving straight culture. Many queers still keep their sexualities and gender-nonconformity away from blood relatives, and only express who they really are in chosen spaces like bars and clubs. Queer people around the country acutely felt that the attack on Pulse was an attack on LGBT people everywhere; they expressed their solidarity with vigils, posters at pride marches, and #weareorlando or #orlandostrong posts on social media. But for Eddies queer family, the attack was not merely symbolic it was terrifyingly real and personal. I found myself adopted briefly by that family. A friend connected me with Aurora Sexton, a trans drag performer whos close with Neema; she had come to Orlando that week to perform at several benefits, and I joined her there. I had never been to Orlando before, but I found the LGBT spaces in this city to be the most inclusive Id ever experienced even after those spaces had been wracked by unspeakable tragedy. Here, a Puerto Rican gay man had considered a gay man of Persian descent his adoptive mother. In turn, both men counted trans women, queer women, drag queens, gay men, and other gender-nonconforming people all of a variety of races as good friends, which is common among queer people in the Orlando nightlife scene. The stark divisions that exist among members of the LGBT community in some other cities arent as much of a reality here. And if Orlando has become a national symbol of tragedy, it can also be a symbol of possibility reminding us that longstanding factions within the queer community can and do unite. They did so in Orlando, even before a gunman opened fire. We didnt have to make an effort to get people to come together, a local gay pastor and friend of Neemas said at the memorial. We already knew what to do. Neemas house, where the memorial was held, seemed blandly suburban from the outside with its shingled roof and vinyl siding, but the interior was more modern, with dark gray floors, leather couches, and cherry furniture. The house also had a big backyard, a pool with softly curved sides, and an open garage piled with boxes upon boxes of donations for Pulse employees. On one side of the living room near the front door, several framed pictures of Eddie stood atop a high side table, surrounded by candles and an orchid plant with several white flowers in bloom, forming an improvised altar. One of the pictures was signed by friends, which Neema said will hang at Pulse when it reopens. The photo showed Eddie in profile wearing a black top hat, his signature accessory when he went out. He looked decidedly debonair and fun, in contrast to the brooding image of him in a button-down thats been shared so widely on the internet. View this image  A makeshift altar for Eddie. Via facebook.com After everyone had arrived, Neema asked the group to gather around. He told them that he and Eddies partner of three years, Luis Rojas, had met with President Obama the day before. Originally from Mexico, Rojas was at Pulse the night of the shooting, but had gone to his car right before the gunman opened fire. I was hoping Luis would be here, Neema said, but his family came today and theyre not from this country. Theyre going to find out that he loves a man for the first time. He went on to talk about how much Eddie loved life, and how he started wearing his top hat all the time when he realized how much attention it got him. Earlier, Neema and others had talked about how they disliked the way news reports made him out to be such an angel even though he was salty and sarcastic. For his queer relatives, the established rituals of honoring the dead and emphasizing blood family have flattened Eddies life, highlighting only the most respectable parts of his story. This private memorial was an opportunity for Eddies queer family to remember him on their own terms, away from the expectations of others. Does anyone have anything to say about Eddie? Neema asked with an impish grin that momentarily brightened his grief-stricken face. For once, he cant talk back. Laughter followed, then muted sobs. CJ, a trans woman and former drag queen who now works for a telecommunications company in Rochester, New York, looked around before raising her hand. She told a story about how she once went on a cruise with Eddie and a group of friends. Eddie was just so outgoing and friendly and good-looking, she said, growing more animated as she spoke. It wasnt long before he turned heads and got attention. These boys were just falling for him. She talked about how Eddie would get together with members of the crew, only for him to ditch them a couple of days later for a different guy. We just laughed at those boys, CJ concluded, resolutely refusing to make him out to be a perfect man. Thats our Eddie. Other stories followed a pattern: People had met Eddie through Neema, and he seemed mean at first, though they later realized he was being protective of his queer mom, who was a lot more open and welcoming. Laughter and sorrow continued to intertwine that night. Many members of this family queer entertainers or club staff in Orlando and elsewhere will keep working in the days and months following the shooting, keeping up the gay bars and clubs that are the sources of their livelihood, all of which have become symbols of resilience in the shootings aftermath. Theyll put on brave faces because its their job to serve other peoples needs. But here, in Neemas house, they can let down their defenses and simply be there for each other simply remember that Eddie Sotomayor was a real, actual person they loved, before he became a symbol of a tragedy borne out of hatred for queer people. View this image  Volunteers collect and manage donations for Pulse employees. Meredith Talusan / BuzzFeed News Two days before Eddies private memorial, most of the people there had to manage their grief in public, some of them while working. Southern Nights another major club in Orlando that shares some staff and entertainers with Pulse hosted a benefit on behalf of that clubs employees to make up for lost income while the club is shut down, featuring a bunch of drag queens and entertainers from across the country. There was a gargantuan line to get in, snaking around the clubs parking lot, as two security people scanned patrons with metal detectors and informed them that no bags were allowed. Inside, before the show began, Neema spoke to the gathered crowd. He emphasized the clubs intention to rebuild in the wake of the tragedy. When we reopen, he stressed, were going to be better, were going to fight, and were going to defeat all the evil thats out there. He emphasized determination in the face of tragedy, even as the prolonged hugs he received from hosts and staff as he left the stage hinted at his profound grief. The club seemed at once tiny and vast. Large numbers of people were packed inside the main space where the show was going to be. A sunken area with a stage in front of it was flanked with a bar on each side, one of which had a glass counter lit with a cool white light that made it feel both futuristic and retro, in a garish late-80s kind of way. The club felt familiar, like so many other queer clubs The EndUp in San Francisco, Escuelita in New York, or G-A-Y in London dark places where people at the margins of society can let loose and be themselves. But this wasnt just any night at any gay club: There were large donation boxes at both the entrance and the bars, people selling raffle tickets to benefit victims, patrons hugging each other for comfort, asking each other if they knew anyone who died. While hordes of people shifted back and forth as they waited for the show to start, it also became clear that the crowd was unusually mixed so much so that it became hard to identify peoples individual places on the LGBT spectrum. There were the standard muscle gay boys, mostly white and some Latino. There were also femme gay boys and genderqueers, including a slim guy in a loose, shiny skirt with tights underneath. And there was someone who seemed like a drag queen in over-the-top, kabuki-inspired makeup, but was, judging by the pitch of her voice, a cis woman. You see queers of all stripes here, even before the shooting, a woman next to me said when I asked her if this was typical. One of the co-hosts, Roxxxy Andrews from RuPauls Drag Race and a former cast member at Pulse, announced that there were 40 performers over three sets that night. The show began and one survival anthem after the other played, from Kelly Clarksons People Like Us to Lady Gagas Born This Way. Neema once again went onstage to introduce Blue Star. A lesbian performer and Pulses former entertainment manager, Blue continued to be friends with many of the clubs employees, and was known in the community as a tireless organizer in times of need. Neema described how Blue organized donations, provided phones for all the staff members who needed them, and got volunteers to put together care packages to deliver to the Pulse staff. Blue came out to immediate cheers, wearing a simple, short black jumpsuit, her face nearly bare as her eyes glistened while she held back tears. Slim and blonde, she stood firm in a wide stance as she began the club anthem One Love. Ive been through the pain, Ive been through the hurt. Afterward, she moved through the crowd and hugged several people. Dozens of hands reached out with bills that she collected for a fund to help Pulse employees recover from the shooting. The audience instinctively knew that her relationship to the tragedy was deeply personal. Yet Blues determined stance also held deep reserves of grief at bay. Earlier that day, I found her sobbing uncontrollably in the dark corner of the performance space she ran that functioned temporarily as a warehouse for donations, in an industrial area that the city is developing as a cultural zone, while Pulse and Southern Nights were a 15-minute drive away in the outskirts of downtown. She was playing a video on her phone that a Pulse employee had sent, thanking her for sending a care package. Pulse is my family, she told me after she regained her composure. There was no question in my mind I needed to help. After Blues performance, I exited the perimeter of the crowd struggling to see the show, and there was an immediate abundance of air and space. I found a white faux-leather couch next to the performers dressing room, where drag queens walked in and out. Melody Maia Monet, a trans woman of Puerto Rican and Colombian descent who had come to Orlando in 2011 to rebuild her life after transitioning in her late thirties, headed into the dressing room to visit a friend. Inside, there was a flurry of activity as queens inside got in and out of costume, some preparing on the floor because there were too many people. Maia, who became immersed in the Orlando queer scene as a singer and photographer, pointed out to me which queens were gay and which ones were trans (the former hadnt made modifications to their bodies, while the latter had). The difference didnt seem to matter much in the queer world of Orlando. Because most of the trans women performers started out as drag queens and still play that role onstage, their ties to gay people tend to remain even after they transition. Chevelle Brooks, a black trans woman who was at Pulse that night but managed to get out, was exhausted and on her way home. Another trans drag queen, Nicky Monet, passed through to say hello. At the benefit, she was larger than life in a bright-pink sequined dress, bedazzled hoop earrings, and fake eyelashes, as she led a group of people in a gospel-inspired number. But in her tank top and jean shorts afterward, the trans woman with curly dark hair and light olive skin didnt stand out in any particular way. She was a substitute performer at Southern Nights, and used to perform at Pulse. Nicky made it clear, as so many queer people I spoke to in Orlando did, that the shooting was motivated by hate against queers. But more than this, Nicky was adamant that the shooter attacked not just gay but also trans people, even if to her knowledge, no one who died was trans. This isnt just one shooter, she added. There wasnt just the bullets that killed those people. Theres the bullet of last week, [when] we couldnt pee in the right bathroom. Theres the bullet of being harassed and threatened on the street. Later, as I waited for a cab outside the club, Maia passed by with a large plastic garbage can to take to the dumpster, even though she wasnt officially working that night. As the initial shock and grief after the shooting had waned, what remained was peoples different ways of coping. Maia observed that for her, Blue, and many volunteers, physical labor was a way to get through the pain. She also felt that for people like Neema, focusing on the feelings of others allowed them to keep their own grief at bay. It was a process with no conceivable end date. Well still be here after the cameras are gone, she said. As I opened my cab door, Axel Andrews a young, androgynous bartender and drag performer at Pulse who Id been introduced to that night, and who had been trapped in a dressing room for hours during the shooting came out of the club and waved. Take care of yourself, he said. Be safe. View this image  Shantell DMarco, who lost several friends in the shooting, performing at Parliament House. Meredith Talusan / BuzzFeed News On the following evening, in a quiet, intimate dressing room, away from the crowd and loud music outside, the current Miss Gay USofA, Aurora Sexton, was putting on her Miley Cyrus outfit. We were at Parliament House, a queer resort and club that was hosting another benefit for Pulse employees on their own regular Latin night. Aurora flew in from Nashville to help out, and had stayed up until 5 the morning of the shooting to make sure everyone she knew personally was safe, which they were, but friends of friends werent so lucky. It could have easily been our club, Aurora said as she asked me to zip up the costume she had made herself, a white leotard that had two sets of zippers and a hook. I know the type of people who would want to hurt us, she continued. When you espouse hate speech, and when you repeat over and over that gay people are wicked, that trans people are predators and molesters and you scare people, its going to incite some of those people to violence. Aurora wanted to have one last drink before she performed. At the bar, she ran into her good friend Kristofer Reynolds, a muscular man with dirty-blonde hair and a goatee. He was a drag photographer who was on staff at Pulse for years before moving to San Diego two years ago, after a breakup. He said his pictures used to hang on Pulses walls, but he didnt know if they were still there after the shooting. Hes close with many of the Pulse staff, especially Neema Bahrami. I havent figured out what it all means yet, said Kristofer. I just know I lost my friends. Among the people Kristofer knew who died, he was closest to Eddie Sotomayor. But he still wasnt sure exactly how many of the victims he knew, how many of them he photographed. I dont know their names, Kristofer said, but I see pictures and I remember, He said hi to me once or, Thats the guy who asked me to take his picture. If Pulse is a queer family, its as though Kristofers brother Eddie died, but so did distant cousins, uncles, and aunts, people he encountered on occasion maybe even danced with once or twice, but didnt know particularly well. Knowing theyre gone, and that a club that was a second home to him for many years must be in shambles, has shaken him in a way hes been unable to fully grasp. View this image  Neema Bahrami in the dressing room of Parliament House. Meredith Talusan / BuzzFeed News All I can feel right now is anger, he said. I havent had time to feel anything else. When Aurora came back to the common dressing room, she ran into Shantell DMarco, a trans drag queen originally from Cuba who was a regular performer at Parliament House, and had come in to freshen up one last time before her number, wearing a salmon-colored pantsuit with sequins and giving off a Jennifer Lopez vibe. The two knew each other well from having performed together, and Shantell had once crowned Aurora at a gay pageant. Shantell talked about how difficult its been to work while dealing with the shootings aftermath. Did you go to a funeral today? Aurora asked gently. Shantell nodded, fighting back emotion. Seven of my friends died, she said. I was really close to two of them. After her performance, Aurora returned to the dressing room to find Neema comforting one of the other queens who had performed, who was also a friend of Eddies. She was doubled over, sobbing. I lost my best friend, Neema said, presenting himself as a figure of resilience. He told her over and over again in different ways that they mustnt let the forces of evil win, and that they have to be strong. Its what Eddie would have wanted. After the queen calmed down, another staff member also started crying in the dressing room. Neema rushed over to hug him, as though despair were infectious and he was trying to prevent an outbreak. Neema seemed resolute, though a witness told me he too had broken down after he spoke at a vigil two days after the shooting. Blue Star, the lesbian performer whod been coordinating donations for the Pulse employees and was close to Neema, had needed to comfort him as he wailed. At that moment, it was Blue who performed the role of mother for Neema. View this image  Aurora Sexton, in the dressing room at Parliament House. Meredith Talusan / BuzzFeed News At 2 in the morning, when that nights work was done, a small group gathered to head to the house where Kristofer was staying for some respite in private. Among them were Neema, Aurora, and a couple of other friends from out of town who had come to remember Eddie. Neema volunteered to drive. As he stared at the road, he talked about how difficult its been to relive that night whenever people tried to ask him about it. But among his close friends, he was able to talk about his gruesome memories: how the gunman laughed between bouts of shooting. How a water main broke and flooded parts of the club, so people whod pretended to be dead had to come up for air and got shot. That one of the pulse employees hid under several dead bodies to survive. The car turned from a major street into a quiet suburban neighborhood. Once the group had gotten inside the house and gathered around a formica kitchen counter, lit by the harsh glow of fluorescent lights, Neema opened the fridge and started taking out food. Im a registered nurse, he said, urging everyone to eat the pasta and biscuits he was serving,but I started working at clubs because it paid better. The conversation woke up CJ, who had flown in earlier that day and left Parliament House early to get some sleep. After eating, Neema decided to go into one of the bedrooms to get some rest. The others followed and piled into the queen-sized bed with him. CJ, a large woman who spoke loudly and with expansive gestures, got up and started dancing around the dimly lit room in her red satin negligee; her breasts threatened to expose themselves at any moment. She had known Neema and Eddie for over a decade, back in the days when she was a drag queen herself. After her gender transition, CJ decided to stop performing and be more quiet about her gender history, though she didnt let go of her longstanding ties to her queer family. Im supposed to be in mourning! she yelled. Dont stop, Neema told her. If Eddie was here, hed be the one to start. Everyone started egging CJ on to dance as she bent over lasciviously. Someone in the group of seven people started singing Big Spender from the musical Sweet Charity as everyone else joined in and laughed at lyrics like I dont pop the cork for every guy I see. Then CJ licked her finger suggestively at the end of the song. Neema watched, smiling, but his eyes were vacant, even as several other people were laughing uncontrollably. Abruptly, one of the men announced that he wanted to go to bed, and everyone fell quiet as he left the room. In the middle of the night, the revelry ended as suddenly as it began. Theyd been determined to keep partying through their pain, but there were times when the burden proved too hard to bear. As the group dispersed, Neema got up and closed the bedroom door. View this image  A picture of the 49 victims of the Orlando shooting, signed by Pulse employees. Meredith Talusan / BuzzFeed News Pulse employees convened at Neemas house after Eddies private memorial. As the house filled up, Neema instructed his guests to have some of the copious amounts of food piled in the kitchen some of which he and his relatives had prepared, some of which had been donated and to go and sit in the backyard. Outside, a young Asian employee talked about going to the Victim Service Center, where the government and a number of companies offered help to those directly affected by the shooting. He talked about how a couple of airlines were offering free tickets to Pulse employees, so he was able to get one to New York to visit his family in a couple of weeks; he encouraged the other employees gathered around to go. Neema asked everyone to come back inside, and as he took the floor to speak, he emphasized to the crowd of about 60 people that Pulse will reopen as an even better club. He chided Blue for being late when she arrived in a long summer dress and cornrows, and they bantered about her being a white woman with blonde hair wearing a black style. Soon, though, her tone turned both businesslike and somber. She discussed her and the local communitys commitment especially that of queer entertainers and staff at other bars and clubs to help employees and others affected by the shooting. Were not just here until the cameras are gone, Blue said. Well be here a week from now, a month from now, six months from now, until you all get back on your feet. Neema brought out a framed picture of the 49 victims from the Pulse shooting, and told the employees he would leave it on a table outside for them to sign. But first, there was a group picture. As I headed outside with the group, a young black woman motioned for me to join them for the photo. I started to explain that I wasnt connected to Pulse when she put her hand gently on my arm to interrupt. It doesnt matter, the woman said. Youre family. After the picture, Axel came by to say hello. I hope youre OK, he said. I know its a lot. Blue sat on one side of the pool, looking worn out from her efforts over the past week. After several days of focusing on fundraising and collecting donations for Pulse employees, she also gave a number of interviews to media outlets and performed in several benefits. She just nodded when I asked her how she was doing, as though the emotional and physical toll of the week was finally hitting her. Everyone there clearly needed this time to grieve among people who had been to the club, who had been their friends before the most horrific thing that could possibly have happened to them came to pass. As much as I and so many other queer people have imagined and identified with what they must be dealing with, theres no way to fully understand what its like to lose that specific friend or lover, that specific cherished sanctuary of a club the one youve relied on as a home for your chosen family. On one side of the pool, Axel and Blue each faced a group of friends, but occasionally turned their heads and glanced at each other. Neema watched as the Pulse employees came over and petted a group of docile comfort dogs that had recently arrived. As one mischievous golden retriever edged over to the side of the pool and put out his paws to get into the water, an employee scrambled to hold on to his leash to keep him from jumping in. Everyone started laughing and, for a brief moment, their gathering space was one of joy. View this image  Pulse employees and friends.

aS"I used to worry about my body hair and what people thought of it until I started going out with girls. View this image  Rebecca Hendin / BuzzFeed My adolescence marked the beginning of a painful struggle with body hair. Before puberty, I lived in a happy, carefree world where my only worry was how to properly untangle the long, curly hair on my head. Then there came the hair on my legs, under my arms, and on my genitals, plus all the troubles that went along with it. First of all, I had to learn how to make it disappear. Choose a method: Is the epilator really worse than waxing? Does your hair really grow back thicker if you use a razor? I was very anxious and full of questions. Did I have to remove the hair on my thighs as well? (One friend told me no, be careful not to, while another said totally, otherwise its dirty. It was an awfully complicated issue and everyone had clear-cut opinions.) Even more complicated: How should I remove the hair on my genitals? I had to find a balance that was neither too neglected nor too slutty in the words of my group of friends back then and we all know that the line between these two is thin. This took up a lot of my time and mental energy. I tried everything. To start, I had my first appointment with a beautician, a.k.a the nine circles of hell. I have never understood how a place thats supposed to be so nice, where you can get a super-relaxing massage and youre supposed to feel more beautiful, could be so awful and guilt-inducing. Every time the beautician began to study the fleece on my little teenaged legs, shed shake her head slightly in disapproval. And very often, shed make a little comment: Ah, yes, there is a lot. Have you shaved since your last visit? Its obvious. And very, very, very often: You have an ingrown hair. You must exfoliate once a week. You already do that? Then try twice a week. Exfoliation, its important! Despite all the trouble I went through to exfoliate my skin ever so thoroughly, I got the impression I was failing an important test in knowing how to be feminine. I also tried various types of wax: cold and hot, the kind you heat up in the microwave that burns, and a variety with a roll-on cap that facilitates the application (except when the cap gets detached and all the wax spills on you). Next I tried an epilator, a product touting a completely new, great revolutionary system to save you some pain, and an awful-smelling depilatory cream. But the icing on the shitty package was discovering that after all this effort, the hair just grows back. What a pain! Based on the information Id gleaned, I concluded that waxing was better than shaving, but the problem was you had to let it grow back a bit before you could remove the unwanted hair. Yet a girl was never supposed to have hair on her legs, not even for a few days. So, what could I do? This was particularly anxiety-inducing because, as a teenager, I had a few boyfriends who might potentially see my legs. Back then I was trying to be heterosexual (spoiler: it didnt work). To be perfect in all circumstances, I had to find a way to get an appointment with the overbooked beautician when my hair was long enough to be removed. But not so long that Id be completely embarrassed while waiting. Waxing was mandatory before a date, but not right before, or the red dots of all the hair follicles traumatized by this pruning against nature would be too visible. Anyway, it was an adventure, and I should have gotten a medal for the many times I managed it all like a queen. I realize now that instead of asking Which hair removal technique should I choose? I should have just asked myself: Are all these hassles really necessary?! But it was impossible then, when according to the standards set by my friends, TV and magazines, a woman simply could not be anything but smooth as a pebble polished by the sea water. In fact, Id never even seen another womans legs in their natural state, which gave me the impression that I was particularly unlucky. At the time, there was no Tumblr filled with pictures of proudly hairy womens legs and thats a shame, because it would have allowed me to let out a big sigh of relief. The few times my boyfriends could see a (tiny) bit of hair starting to grow back, I heard what they thought. Sometimes their tone was joking, or amazed. They never intended to be mean, but deep down there was still a reproach: Id failed to maintain my femininity. So it was difficult for me to feel any more relaxed about this hairy question. Then one day, in college, I finally realized that it was desperately useless for me to be dating guys, because I actually liked girls. And for the first time, I found myself in a relationship with someone who knew exactly as well as I did how much the business of hair removal sucks. The change occurred fairly gradually. I knew that waxing hurt, so I didnt mind a little fuzz on the women I dated. Her hair grew back? Not a problem. I wouldnt judge her. Looking back, I even found those little hairs sprouting on her legs very cute. It didnt prevent her from seducing me. And she had better things to do, anyway: Id rather have her spend the next two hours in my arms watching a movie than rush off to remove the slightest bit of excess body hair. At the same time, I understood that this goodwill was fully shared, and it wasnt really a problem if my own removal situation wasnt spick and span. I felt a level of relief as intense as my old stress had been. Body hair was no longer a source of unmanageable pain, but a topic of free discussion with another person. We could show one another our hair without drama, study it, compare it. This called a lot of things into question for me and cast body hair as an object worthy of rehabilitation. Why should a woman remove her body hair at all costs? A few years ago, my then-partner preferred to keep her legs natural, and that was just fine. Of course, I dont want to generalize: there are plenty of gay women who are stressed out by their body hair, as well as straight couples who are quite relaxed around this issue. But for me, dating women is what changed my mind. Regretfully, there are still limits to my carefree attitude on body hair. Im well aware that when it comes to my own grooming, Ive normalized the standard of hairless skin for too long to throw my razors in the trash for good. So I continue to remove my own hair, but now I do it in a somewhat bohemian way. I dont go to the salon anymore. From time to time, I use an epilator on my legs and a razor under my arms. I get most of it; its rarely flawless. I dont worry if my hair grows back and I dont have the time to take care of it; Ill do it later. In the same way, I stopped exfoliating. And Ive got news Id like to share with all beauticians I crossed paths with. For years, I was committed to scrubbing and scrubbing and scrubbing my legs with exfoliating gel, loofahs and bath puffs. Then I stopped completely and it didnt change a thing. Nada, niet, zero. I didnt get more ingrown hairs, or less. All those years I spent scrubbing myself cost me a ton of money and a lot of hours I could have spent watching The Good Wife. And thats a shame. A few days ago, I realized that I hadnt taken care of my underarms for a while. I could see a little fluff beginning to grow in the mirror. I looked a little closer and saw that the hair under my right armpit was much longer than on the left: clearly, the last time Id shaved, Id been in such a hurry Id forgotten about one side. And Id stayed like that for several days without noticing it: hairless skin on the left, hairy on the right. Of course, I rushed to show my girlfriend my finding. We had a pretty good laugh.

aS'The law providing protections for those with religious objections to same-sex couples marriages violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments, a federal judge ruled late Thursday night. The law was due to go into effect on Friday. View this image  Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant Mike Blake / Reuters WASHINGTON A federal judge halted the anti-LGBT religious exemption law passed in Mississippi earlier this year from going into effect moments before it was due to do so. Under the guise of providing additional protection for religious exercise, it creates a vehicle for state-sanctioned discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, U.S. District Court Carlton Reeves wrote of the law. It is not rationally related to a legitimate end. Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant signed the bill, HB 1523, into law on April 5. The bill provided protections for individuals, religious organizations, and certain businesses who take actions due to their sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions to same-sex marriage or any sex outside straight marriage. It also provided similar protections for those who object to transgender people. The law prohibited the state from discriminating against people who act or refuse to act because of one of those beliefs. As Reeves put it, An organization or person who acts on a [protected] belief is essentially immune from State punishment. The law also provided that county clerks could recuse themselves from issuing marriage licenses based on their religious or moral beliefs a provision Reeves criticized in another ruling earlier this week. The new law quickly faced several legal challenges, all of which were consolidated to be heard by Reeves. He heard arguments a week ago on a request to enjoin the law or halt it from going into effect altogether. He agreed to do so late Thursday night, finding that the law violated the First Amendments Establishment Clause and the Fourteenth Amendments Equal Protection Clause, moments before the law would have gone into effect at 12:01 a.m. Friday. Reeves initially got involved with these issues when he was assigned to hear the challenge to the states ban on same-sex couples marriages back in 2014. Roberta Kaplan, the Paul Weiss lawyer who had successfully represented Edie Windsor in her challenge to the Defense of Marriage Act, also represented those plaintiffs in Mississippi. Reeves ruled the the marriage ban was unconstitutional, and later issued a permanent injunction stopping enforcement of the marriage ban. After Bryant signed HB 1523 into law, Kaplan asked Reeves to re-open that case to consider the effect of the recusal provision on the permanent injunction entered in the marriage case. All of the other cases filed against HB 1523 eventually were consolidated to be heard by Reeves. HB 1523 grants special rights to citizens who hold one of three sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions reflecting disapproval of lesbian, gay, transgender, and unmarried persons, Reeves wrote in the Thursday night decision. That violates both the guarantee of religious neutrality and the promise of equal protection of the laws. Explaining his decision to stop the law from going into effect on Friday, as it had been slated to do, Reeves found that the plaintiffs had standing to sue and that the state officials sued were the appropriate parties. He also found that it was proper for the plaintiffs to bring the suit before the law went into effect. Regarding the equal protection argument, Reeves did not mince words: The title, text, and history of HB 1523 indicate that the bill was the States attempt to put LGBT citizens back in their place after Obergefell [v. Hodges]. The majority of Mississippians were granted special rights to not serve LGBT citizens, and were immunized from the consequences of their actions. LGBT Mississippians, in turn, were put in a solitary class with respect to transactions and relations in both the private and governmental spheres to symbolize their second-class status. After further analysis of equal protection law, and the effects of HB 1523, he concluded: The deprivation of equal protection of the laws is HB 1523s very essence. As to the Establishment Clause, he wrote: The essential insight from history is that the First Amendment was originally enacted to prohibit a state from creating second-class Christians. And while the law has expanded to protect persons of other faiths, or no faith at all, the core principle of government neutrality between religious sects has remained constant through the centuries. As to HB 1523, then, he concluded the law violated the Establishment Clause in at least two ways. First, Reeves wrote, On its face, HB 1523 constitutes an official preference for certain religious tenets. If three specific beliefs are protected by this act, it follows that every other religious belief a citizen holds is not protected by the act. Second, he found, HB 1523 also violates the First Amendment because its broad religious exemption comes at the expense of other citizens. Because Reeves found these violations and that the other requirements for injunctive relief were met, he issued the preliminary injunction stopping state officials from enacting or enforcing HB 1523 late Thursday night. UPDATE On Friday, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant, a Republican, said in a statement that he look[s] forward to an aggressive appeal, but the states Democratic attorney general, Jim Hood, adopted a more cautious tone. Noting that [t]he federal courts ruling was straightforward and clear, Hood said in his statement, Our attorneys will evaluate this decision to determine whether or not to appeal all or parts of Thursdays ruling. In consideration of the individual rights of all our citizens, the states current budget crisis and the cost of appeal, I will have to think long and hard about spending taxpayer money to appeal the case against me.

aS"The person appointed to this new role will be responsible for monitoring violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. View this image  US Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power arrives for an informal meeting of the U.N.s LGBT Core Group at the Stonewall Inn earlier this month. Bryan R. Smith/AFP / Getty Images The United Nations Human Rights Council voted Thursday to create the institutions first LGBT rights watchdog. The resolution passed in a vote of 23 to 18, with six abstentions. The person appointed to this role will be known as an independent expert and the position is charged with monitoring violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. This was the most ambitious effort yet to advance LGBT rights within the U.N. system, and the resolution included the strongest language to date suggesting LGBT rights should be a concern of international human rights law. The two previous resolutions concerning LGBT rights passed by the U.N. Human Rights Council merely called for the U.N.s human rights office to prepare reports examining LGBT rights. But these and the few other mentions of sexual orientation or gender identity in other U.N. documents have been so modest that the U.N. Security Council made headlines by including a reference to sexual orientation in a press statement condemning the attack on a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida even though the document was not a formal resolution, it was notable that the U.N.s most powerful committee had mentioned sexual orientation in any kind of declaration. But opponents of the resolution, led by Pakistan on behalf of almost all members of the Organization for Islamic Cooperation (OIC), succeeded in adding several amendments that framed the LGBT rights proposal as a cultural imposition intending to override local values and sovereignty. Albania, which is a co-sponsor of the resolution, was the sole member of the OIC to break from the bloc. These amendments include a handful that urge respect for local values, religious sensitivities, and domestic politics. Another amendment suggests the resolution undermines universal human rights values to impose concepts or notions pertaining to social matters, including private individual conduct. An additional amendment condemned coercive measures to change national policies, a slap at donor nations that have adjusted international aid in response to anti-LGBT laws. The U.S. and some European governments adjusted their aid to Uganda following its adoption of a sweeping anti-LGBT law in 2014, and the World Bank also suspended a major loan in response. One of the most surprising votes was South Africas decision to abstain when the resolution came up for final passage. South Africa had sponsored the first LGBT rights resolution in the Human Rights Council, and for years its leadership was considered essential because it rebutted the argument that LGBT rights were being imposed by the U.S. and Europe on former colonial nations. South Africas representative said it could not support the resolution because the sponsors arrogant and confrontational approach would divide the Human Rights Council, and claimed South Africas path out of apartheid argues for a more collaborative approach. The ambassadors statement is a betrayal of the essence of South Africas constitution, said Graeme Reid, a South African LGBT rights advocate who now heads Human Rights Watchs LGBT program. To invoke the struggle against apartheid as justification for not supporting a resolution on violence and discrimination is both inaccurate and cynical. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS'Ive always been the kind of feminist to speak out against cisnormative and patriarchal beauty standards. But as a black trans woman, getting my breasts augmented would make me feel safer in public, and help me feel more at home in my body. Could I reconcile cosmetic surgery with my feminist ideals? View this image  Kate Ferro / BuzzFeed News One summer day during an annual family trip to Jacksonville Beach, Florida, I stood alone, my feet in the sand, the chilly air hitting my hairless, androgynous chest. I was 11 years old. I felt so exposed with just my swim trunks on, sensing that I needed to cover up even though there was nothing there. I wondered why I didnt feel comfortable like my brother and my dad being shirtless in the sun. Seagulls circled ominously above us, foreshadowing the struggle I would continue to have with my body throughout what I would later call my first puberty. A decade later, in the summer of 2012, I took my first estrogen injection as a part of my gender transition. Within a few weeks, the sensitivity and soreness of the new buds forming under my skin gave me hope. Soon, though, I felt a new sort of shame this time from an external source. My friends and partner at the time quickly urged me to get my first sports bra. Even though I was excited about my changing body, that excitement was charged with an undercurrent of annoyance. Why were my barely protruding nipples already becoming politicized, a piece of public property to be controlled and critiqued? By last summer, I was mostly satisfied with my body. My face had softened considerably, my skin was smoother, and I had some semblance of breasts. But whenever I was naked, any confidence in my womanhood would quickly deflate. Those now medium-sized buds, though larger, were still a source of discomfort for me. I started considering the possibility of getting my breasts augmented. I stewed over the decision for months before asking others for advice. Most of the time, I was met with static. My mother would respond with well-intentioned platitudes, like Youre beautiful the way you are. Everyone else in my life had similar opinions: You shouldnt get them done, some would say. Natural is always better. A handful is enough. This flood of comments made me wonder whether it mattered how I felt about my breasts, if everyone else in my life insisted they were fine the way they were. Throughout my transition, my chest wasnt the only thing that made me feel vulnerable. There was also my Adams apple, which would be sore for days on end from my attempts to push it in so much. I had it surgically shaved down early in my transition, after which I halfheartedly vowed that I wouldnt have any more cosmetic surgery done. I wanted to be able to more easily say, Im all natural. It gave me a sense of superiority especially because I wanted to be the kind of feminist who not only speaks out against cisnormative and patriarchal beauty standards, but eschews them in her own daily life. Around September of last year, my discomfort with my breasts began to supersede my desire to adhere to an unwritten feminist standard. I thought that if this was something I wanted if it would truly improve my life why not go for it. But I was worried about what the choice would mean when it came to my relationship with feminism. As the clich goes, any time youre unhappy with something in your life, change it. Thats the accepted mindset when it comes to losing weight, getting a new job, or doing something new with your hair but when cosmetic surgery is invoked, its almost never supported with such flippant positivity. Prior to my breast augmentation, I made my fair share of jokes about augmented bodies la Michael Jackson, Lil Kim, and Kylie Jenner. Theres a self-righteousness that accompanies shaming folks who have had cosmetic work done. I found myself far more vocally supportive of good, subtle surgeries than botched or drastic ones. I was also just as harsh as the rest of the world on folks who elect plastic surgery outside of whats deemed medically necessary. When I surveyed friends and loved ones about what theyd think if I got my breasts augmented, many would grant my potential decision more validity because Im trans. Theres an insistence that all kinds of surgeries are a necessity for transition for a trans person to truly feel at home in their bodies or to even be attractive but thats not true, at least for me. While breast augmentation was something I thought I might want, it wasnt a prerequisite for transition. The truth is, while some trans folks cant see their lives going on without certain physical transition goals being met, I always knew that surgery wouldnt make me more of a woman Im a woman no matter what my body looks like. But as a black woman, it was difficult to embrace myself early on: I had a rail-thin body, no curves, and a flat chest. black women with bodies like this are often seen as less valuable and desirable within the black community, even if glorified in the mainstream beauty industry. Youll see thin black models on runways and in magazines, but black women with large breasts and butts have long been heralded as paragons of feminine beauty in music videos and black media. When it comes to the intersection of cosmetic surgery and black womanhood, I cant help but think about the scrutiny constantly hurled at rapper and sex icon Nicki Minaj. She has the textbook example of whats considered the perfect black womans body: breasts that spill over most of her outfits, a cinched waist, and the pice de rsistance a full ass. Though many salivate at her assets, others critique her body to the ends of the earth. And when they do, they speak of her alleged plastic surgery with disdain. Minaj, like all women, is held to a ridiculous double standard. On one hand, were supposed to be able to say, I woke up like this, but on the other, women who arent conventionally beautiful and dont put in the exhaustive effort to appear so are derided and shamed. Black women also live in the shadow of Saartjie Baartman and what she has meant historically to a society ruled by the white gaze. Black women without curves arent valued not to mention that black women with too many curves arent appreciated either. That celebration is reserved for women with a certain breasts-to-waist-to-hips ratio (or the slim-thick variety). Often, thats the kind of body many could get only from having some type of surgery. Theres such a small box in which black women can exist peacefully and without shame. Beyond the personal self-esteem benefits a breast augmentation would bring, I anticipated being able to pass more easily among other women. Beyond conforming to beauty standards, having a passable body would allow me to move through the world without drawing as much negative attention to myself. For so many trans people, living as closely to mainstream beauty standards as possible can be a major key to survival. Before hundreds of hormone shots, I didnt have that privilege. Walking out of the door was a daily game of Russian roulette. From awkward stares to rude interactions to a heightened threat of violence, the results of not blending in were hard to bear. To eschew archetypal transition goals is courageous in a society that stipulates we must all identify as either a man or a woman, and fit into the narrow scripts of what those categories should look like. And even though I dont subscribe to the flawed binary of masculine and feminine, my own femininity is something Ive reclaimed after spending much of my life being punished for it. By considering breast augmentation, I wasnt intentionally seeking to fit more into a cisnormative, patriarchy-approved beauty ideal but thats exactly the direction my surgery would push me in. And as someone so open about my trans experience and who embraces owning this identity, I struggled with finding power and strength in this decision. But after spending so long asking others about what they thought I should do and worrying what others might think, Id stopped actually listening to myself, or considering the power of my own choices. Plenty of theorists critique choice feminism as both a tool of capitalism and an empty promise. But I still think the decisions we make for ourselves matter. Whats the point of kowtowing to any kind of ideology that requires living with shame and self-hate? Yes, we live in a culture that bombards us with images of a perfect body it would be ridiculous for me to act like Im somehow immune to this phenomenon. But for this queer black trans woman, the expectation to live up to the illusion of the perfect feminist in an age of feminism that still privileges whiteness and cisheteronormativity is just as oppressive to me. In the end, I made the choice to move forward with the surgery for me, and no one else. Im a few months post-op now, and I couldnt feel any happier about my breast augmentation. My life is hardly any different on a macro scale, but I feel more real to me, and freer than ever before. No more doubling up on too-small bras that leave indentations in my skin; no more stuffing bras with balled-up socks and nearly suffocating from the pressure. No more angst. Outside of my family and close friends, I havent really received a measurable amount of attention because of my breasts. This only makes me feel more confident that I made this choice for me, and me alone. I dont think most of us are given a chance to own our insecurities respectfully. For me, this decision was deeper than the surface. I wanted to be able to feel more at home in my body. I think of my body as something that was stolen from me, and my gender transition is a means to reclaim it. I had to endure most of my life feeling like an outsider, but with every transition milestone changing my name, correcting my gender marker, hormones, surgeries I have stepped more and more into a truer self. How can we claim, as feminists, to believe in autonomy and agency when we so harshly critique other womens choices? We cant operate as if beauty is a level playing field. Intersectionality matters when we discuss beauty standards and for a black trans woman, the forces of antiblackness, the patriarchy, and cissexism are co-adversaries. I am not a perfect woman, nor am I a perfect feminist, but not because I had cosmetic surgery. I dont believe that the perfect feminist exists, and I dont believe realness can be gauged. Whats real for me is embracing my desires and goals for myself. I deserve to be happy when I look in the mirror, when Im lying alone in my bed, or even when Im getting intimate with another person. My body is the house in which I live. I own it, and I will decide how to adorn it. I am no longer ashamed of my body, and you shouldnt be ashamed of yours. I am no longer ashamed of my desires for my body, and you shouldnt be ashamed of yours. This is what true liberation looks like.

aS"I just want people to believe I was actually attacked, McSwiggan, who pleaded not guilty to the charge, told BuzzFeed News on Wednesday. L.A. County Sheriff instagram.com McSwiggan was arrested by Los Angeles County Sheriffs deputies a short time later after he was seen allegedly vandalizing a parked car. At the jail, officials said they observed McSwiggan injuring himself with the handle and receiver to a payphone inside the cell, after which he was taken to a local hospital. The 26 year old, known for his personal YouTube videos, pleaded not guilty to the charges of falsely reporting a crime and is due back in court on July 19, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorneys Office. He faces a maximum 364 days in jail if convicted in the case, which remains under investigation, prosecutors said. McSwiggan did not immediately respond to requests for comment regarding the charge of making a false police report. A spokesperson for The Abbey told BuzzFeed News: We are deferring all questions on this to the West Hollywood Sheriff. For that reason, he agreed to share his version of events. After drinking with fellow YouTubers at the Abbey in West Hollywood on Sunday night, McSwiggan said he left the bar with a man and walked to a car nearby. He described himself as being mildly intoxicated at the time more than tipsy, happy, but not falling over. There we were joined by two other guys, who went over to the car. At that point, they decided to attack me, McSwiggan said in the phone interview. McSwiggan also claims the man he walked over with had the keys to the car and vaguely remembers him getting in and out of the car during the attack. I was talking to the main guy and he kept saying my friend Melanies name, I dont remember why, McSwiggan said. I just remember him saying it over and over again and then he suddenly turned from being friendly to hitting me straight in the mouth. McSwiggan claims he blacked out shortly after the other two began kicking him. They did not take any cash off from him although he claims to have had more than $100 on him. When he came to, he said, I remember getting up. The guys were nowhere in sight. I noticed that my front tooth was broken and I was upset and angry and overwhelmed and in that moment I attacked their car and I ripped the wing mirror off and scratched it down the side, he said. When sheriffs deputies arrived, McSwiggan said he explained what happened, including damaging the parked car, but couldnt provide an accurate description of his attackers because he could not remember what they looked like. According to McSwiggan, after showing the damage to the officers, he was arrested and put in the back of the police car. I was the victim of a hate crime and I was being treated like a criminal, McSwiggan said. I understood I had done that to the car, but it didnt take away form the fact that I was still a victim and I needed support and I wanted to talk to my friends and they wouldnt let me. They confiscated my phone and belongings. View on Instagram McSwiggan and his friends before they went out to the Abbey on Sunday night. At the police station, McSwiggan claims he was placed in a holding cell and his requests for medical attention or a lawyer were ignored. He said his father called the station and there was discussion of the bond that would need to be paid for him to be let out. He also said the officer there told him it didnt look like he had been the victim of a hate crime. Thats when he said he took the payphone receiver off the wall and hit himself as hard as he could in the head with it. [T]he next thing I remember is being facedown in a pool of my own blood, and paramedics coming to get me and taking me to hospital, McSwiggan said. His only self-inflicted injury was from the payphone, he added. McSwiggan claims other injuries included three broken teeth, although he only noticed two of them the next day while attempting to eat, and extensive bruising. I know how people are going to try and twist this, but all the information is there and when you put it all together it makes sense and I really hope people see that, he said of all of the discussion of the events. According to Murphys account, McSwiggan left the Abbey with a man who brought him to a parking lot nearby where the alleged attack unfolded. Murphy wrote McSwiggan ripped the side mirror off of what he believed was their car in a blind rage of fear and anger. In the comments of Murphys account, Damien Nichols wrote that he was one of the people with McSwiggan outside the club and contradicted McSwiggans claims, writing at one point, your friend got trashed, damaged someones car, and made up a lie.

aS"The first time the word dyke was hurled at me I turned around and said, So what? What are you going to do about it? View this image  Alice Mongkongllite/ BuzzFeed News Every year at the end of June, the San Francisco Pride Parade starts in the exact same way with the cascading roar of several hundred women starting up their motorcycles at the exact same time. This year was no different. The San Francisco Dykes on Bikes: Womens Motorcycle Contingent, or simply DOB, led the parade down Market Street for the 40th year in a row the parade itself is only 6 years older. Finding their place at the front was easy. The first time a group of female motorcyclists gathered at the head of the SF Pride Parade, in 1976, they were sick and tired of handling their bulky bikes prone to overheating while crawling along at parade-goer pace. As the story goes, an article in the San Francisco Chronicle dubbed the motorcycle club Dykes on Bikes and the name stuck. But earning the right to officially (and legally) label themselves dykes proved to be a lot harder. As the organization grew, the women attempted to protect the moniker for nonprofit use, only to have the trademark office reject their request on the grounds that the term was derogatory to the lesbian community. From 2003 to 2008, the battle over their name continued, until the trademark office yielded following the submission of sufficient evidence that proved activists were reclaiming the word for positive use the iconic television show Queer Eye for the Straight Guy was referenced as a similar example. Today, the DOB has chapters all over the globe, from Melbourne to London to Akureyri, Iceland. All of the women call themselves dykes proudly its fully trademarked, after all. View this image  Sarah Karlan for BuzzFeed News On parade day, the dykes main priority is safety the safety of every rider and the safety of the entire parade that follows behind. DOB members ride up front, followed by other womens motorcycle clubs, independent female riders, Homoto (a gay mens motorcycle club), BARF (Bay Area Riders Forum), and lastly independent male riders. Like a club bouncer you dont want to mess with, the DOB act as leather-clad bodyguards, leading the floats safely down the often treacherous parade route (potholes and cable car tracks are not a bikes best friend). After a gunman massacred 49 people at a gay bar in Orlando earlier this month, safety measures at the pride events that followed nationwide were all the more important. Choosing to be a visible member of the LGBT community continues to be a brave and radical act, and all over the country celebrations moved forward more often than not, led and watched over by a group of dykes on bikes, a group solidly grounded in the belief that everyone should live openly, visibly, and without fear. We spoke with several active DOB members to find out what motivates them to take their place, each and every year, at the front of the parade. View this image  Sarah Karlan for BuzzFeed News I really quickly found myself aligned with who they are as a group of female-identified people just really liked their presence. I liked that they were visible in the LGBT community, because in 2003, 2004, things were a bit different. The first time I saw a parade and [the DOB] were in the front, I was like, Oh, thats what I want to do. Thats who I am. When I joined I was in my early to mid-twenties, so I got to look at a group of people who had come out at different points in their lives and were proud of who they were. I had an opportunity to learn from them and how they existed in the world. Theres a proud history of the DOB being in the front and not backing down; I saw that day-to-day in who they were. I think the thrill, theres a thrill when you ride a motorcycle that you dont get from riding in a car. One of the first times I ever rode by myself, I remember just the smell and the sounds. You appreciate whats around you so much more. Ive had three motorcycles; this one Ive had since 2008. There is a sense of ownership and control on a bike sometimes thats not something thats given to queer women. Claiming that is part of that process. Its power, its showing youre in charge and you dont need help from anyone else. When I first came out, I didnt have a relationship with the word dyke. I was still closeted. For me, that word really embodies courage, and it took me a while to be courageous in who I was and not back down from my sexuality. Now when I think about that word, I am a proud dyke. Its saying, Im going to ride in the front of the parade, Im going to be who I am, Im going to walk in the world the way I am I cant change that. To me its courage and its strength and its not backing down. View this image  Sarah Karlan for BuzzFeed News View this image  Sarah Karlan for BuzzFeed News Ive been riding bikes since I was 10 years old in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. I used to ride a motorcycle home from high school. Thats how I got home from the bus. I was a drum major in high school, so I had marched in a lot of parades. I first got involved riding motorcycles in parades in the New York Pride Parade back in the 1990s. I rode with some of the women cadets from West Point. I was so impressed by their bravery in being willing to be out in public during the era of dont ask, dont tell. Years later, when I moved to California my partner and I went to high school together, so weve known each other for many years we decided that we not only wanted to ride in the parade, but we wanted to be involved in philanthropic endeavors. Thats when I started going to DOB meetings. View this image  Sarah Karlan for BuzzFeed News Its empowering for women that dont ride motorcycles to see women who have embraced their ability to be powerful, to be independent, to demonstrate their freedom, by being on these bikes. By riding a motorcycle and being involved, it can lead you into a place where you can fundraise and you can help the community in a different way. I marched with friends in 1993 at the March on Washington. I remember thinking, Im not up on the podium; am I really participating on a level that makes a difference? Looking back, just being part of the crowd made a difference. I would love for women to realize that you can find a niche in the community where your ability to educate the public and make a difference can help generations. There really isnt an in between when it comes to the word dyke. You can feel it youre either judged or youre embraced. Im from Oklahoma, so it depends where I am if I decide to wear my patch out in public. Sometimes I think its great to educate a group of people and just let them judge. To let people see were not these hellions. Obviously, when youre walking around a place like Pride where youre embraced, its just a lot of fun. Depending on the audience, it can evoke a range of emotions. View this image  Sarah Karlan for BuzzFeed News View this image  Sarah Karlan for BuzzFeed News Ive always wanted a motorcycle. Ever since I was little I always thought they were awesome. I didnt have the type of parents who would let a little girl go biking. As soon as I turned 18, I said I would go do it, but then I kept putting it off. I finally took the nationwide safety class. You take the class, you get a certificate, and then you can bypass the driving portion of the DMV test. Then you get your license. View this image  Sarah Karlan for BuzzFeed News This year, even after Orlando, I feel safe. I trust the law enforcement that will be around I have many friends who are San Francisco police. I feel like its extremely important for us to put on the parade. To be visible, that we are here and unafraid. Thats a lot of it, people are afraid. I know a lot of people who wont come because theyre afraid something bad will happen. Thats not my mentality. Ive never hated the word dyke. Ive always thought it was a great word. Ive self-identified as soft butch, then regular butch. Ive heard a lot of baby dyke from the community, so I went with that. I love being called dyke as long as its not being used derogatorily. When I hear the word dyke Im like, where? [laughs] View this image  Sarah Karlan for BuzzFeed News Ive always wanted to ride a motorcycle, ever since I was a kid. Theyre just cool. There is never a better word for it. Theyre cool. When I was young Id see people riding motorcycles and I thought, I want to do that. I didnt get on a bike until my 40th birthday. Im coming up on my 20th year of riding now. One year, I had just broken up with my girlfriend, so I didnt have anyone to ride on the back of my bike with me. So I called up my mom and said, Mom, you want to ride with me? She said yes. It was her first time being on the motorcycle, first time seeing the parade, and we just had such a good time.  View this image  Sarah Karlan for BuzzFeed News I still get excited about Pride, I do. In some ways society around us has changed but the parade itself, organizing the bikes, that stays the same. The thing that we have seen is that our numbers seem to be slowly dropping off. People dont want to do the parade again and again. Frankly, Orlandos been a wakeup call. Our battles are not over, our struggles are not over. We still need to come out and show people who we are. When we start up the march on parade day, there is a lot of power were sitting on its very loud. You cant deny us. As a community, we need to grieve. As individuals, we need to grieve.

aS"U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter made the announcement Thursday that transgender people are now eligible to serve in all branches of the military. View this image  Defense Secretary Ash Carter Getty Images / Chip Somodevilla The Pentagon has repealed its long-standing ban on transgender people serving openly in the U.S. military effective immediately, Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced Thursday. Americans who want to serve and meet our standards should be afforded the opportunity to do so, Carter said. Implementation will begin today. We dont want barriers limiting a persons qualifications to serve, he said. We have reason to be proud today of what this will mean for our military, because it is the right thing to do, and it is another step in ensuring that we continue to recruit and retain the most qualified people, A previous Department of Defense rule said people with a history transsexualism have a psychosexual condition that renders them medically unfit for service. Under the new rules, Carter said at a Pentagon press briefing, transgender people would be allowed to enlist if they meet certain criteria. A transgender applicant would need to show they have completed their gender transition for 18 months. Further, he said, transgender people currently serving in the military will be able to legally transition to their target gender with the help of the militarys healthcare system and under the guidance of commanding officers. Within 90 days, the militarys medical providers will establish mechanisms for transition-related medical care and changing gender markers within the militarys personnel system. Carter said the policy would be fully implemented to allow promotions and accessions service members including meeting fitness standards of their target gender within a year. After two years, Carter added, the department would review the policies including the rule that applicants must have completed their gender transition for 18 months before enlisting. As BuzzFeed News reported Wednesday, sources familiar with the policys development said the new rules would give commanding officers broad discretion to approve timelines for gender transition by active duty service members, including delaying the transition based on the units needs. Further, those sources said, once a transgender service member enlists or an active member switches their gender, the policy would likely require them to use housing, meet grooming standards, and and wear uniform consistent with their gender identity right away. Likewise, they would use restrooms and shower facilities reflecting their target gender. LGBT military groups praised the announcement, including SPARTA, which has been a leading advocate for reforms since Secretary Carter announced plans to study the issue last July. The thousands of transgender soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen and their commanders have one less burden on their shoulders today, said a statement from dormer army captain and SPARTA president Sue Fulton. We are grateful to the military and civilian leaders in the Department of Defense who worked so hard to get this right, she added. Mara Keisling, the executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, commend[ed] the Pentagons action on Thursday, but noted, We do have remaining concerns about an expected 18-month delay for individuals to join the military after a gender transition. This delay is substantially longer than individuals for comparable medical issues, she said. We hope that this is a lingering piece of transgender exceptionalism that we expect will change as the military sees that it is simply an unnecessary barrier to getting the best talent. An outside consultant, the RAND Corporation, found that healthcare costs would be minimal and that the medical treatment that service members who are currently transgender require is fairly straightforward, well understood, Carter said. He added that the Pentagon found that 18 other nations militaries allow transgender people to serve openly and that major U.S. companies have health insurance plans with transgender inclusive coverage. Thats up from zero such companies in 2002. Although relatively few in number, he said, we are talking about talented Americans serving this country with honor.

aS"The new figures were released Thursday by the Williams Institute, the countrys leading researcher on LGBT demographics. View this image  Getty Images / Sandy Huffaker Roughly 1.4 million adults who live in the United States are transgender, according a new report released Thursday by the countrys leading researcher on LGBT demographics. The figure doubles previous population estimates released in 2011 by the Williams Institute, a division of the UCLA School of Law. The revision, based on new federal data, comes amid an escalating national debate over transgender rights in which conservatives have often downplayed the need for nondiscrimination laws by citing the relatively low number of transgender people. The report, titled How Many Adults Identify as Transgender in the United States, states that transgender people make up 0.6% of the countrys total population. That population is equivalent to that of a metropolis. The report finds that the number of adults who identify as transgender range from state to state with the lowest estimates in North Dakota and Iowa, at 0.3%, and the highest in Hawaii and California, at 0.8% of the population. The figures are based on survey responses in 19 states collected by the Center for Disease Controls Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. In states where the CDC did not collect data on transgender people, researchers say they used statistical models to find ranges of likely population figures to establish credible estimates. Younger people were more likely to report being transgender, the researchers reported. An estimated 0.7% of adults between the ages of 18 and 24 identify as transgender, write Andrew Flores, Jody Herman, Gary Gates, and Taylor Brown. Lower percentages of older adults identify as transgender, with 0.6% of adults age 25 to 64 and 0.5% of adults age 65 or older identifying as transgender. Previous estimates, released by the institution in 2011, pegged the transgender population at 700,000. Researchers speculate that lower figure was due in part to fewer states reporting information and because transgender people may have been less willing to report their gender identity. The report says more robust estimates are possible now due to better survey data, adding, As new data collection efforts emerge at the state and national levels, estimates can continue to be refined to improve our understanding of the size and characteristics of the transgender population.

aS"The new regulations are expected to address admissions, health care, housing, uniforms, nondiscrimination, and more, according to sources familiar with the policys development. View this image  U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter Getty Images / Chip Somodevilla The Department of Defense is expected to unveil a new policy in the coming days or weeks that allows transgender people to serve openly in the U.S. military, sources told BuzzFeed News and other media outlets in the past week. Three individuals familiar with the policys development over the past year have now provided BuzzFeed News insights into major issues that the rules are likely to address. The U.S. Department of Defense has not provided a copy of its final policy to BuzzFeed News. Above all, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter would need to repeal rules that deem transgender people inherently unfit to serve. More than that, the sources said, a practical set of guidelines will likely include standards for transgender military applicants, procedures to let current service members transition their gender, a mechanism to provide health care, rules for housing and dress codes, and other details. According to the sources, these are some of the major areas the policy will cover: Any reform that allows transgender people to join the military would require repealing or amending a Department of Defense rule that says people with a history transsexualism have a psychosexual condition that renders them medically unfit for service. Each branch of the military would need to reform any analogous policies. Transgender people would be allowed to enlist if they meet certain criteria, the sources told BuzzFeed News this week. A transgender applicant would likely need to show they have completed their gender transition. This may include providing proof from a medical professional of gender dysphoria the medical term for being transgender while also showing the gender dysphoria is currently being addressed so that the applicant is not currently feeling distress. (As a general matter, treatments for gender dysphoria include socially living as ones target gender and undergoing hormone replacement therapy under a doctors care. Some transgender people also have surgery to change primary or secondary sex characteristics.) The sources said that a policy is unlikely to mandate that an applicant undergo any specific medical procedure, such as surgery, to enlist. In order to qualify, applicants would also likely need to demonstrate that their gender transition has been complete for a certain time period, the sources said. It is unclear how long that period would be; the sources believed that the military will mandate 18 months between the final stage of transition and when the person applies. The applicant would need to meet the fitness standards as their target gender to be accepted, the sources said. A cornerstone of any policy would be providing care though the Military Health System, the medical provider for military personnel. Once enlisted, service members would be able to seek care from in-house counselors and physicians, the sources said, allowing them to receive treatments and medications. That system already provides certain medications, such as hormones, to non-transgender service members. Likewise, some military surgeons already have experience performing procedures transgender people may require, such as genital reconstruction and breast augmentation. Medical services required outside of the military could be arranged through Tricare, the Defense Departments civilian health coverage program, the sources said. More than 10,000 transgender people are currently enlisted in the military, according to estimates from the Williams Institute at UCLA Law School, yet only a handful are currently able to serve openly. Many of those service members would likely seek to transition after a new policy is announced. The sources said that a policy would likely lay out a framework for branches of the military to create protocols for active service members to transition. Such policies would include service members receiving a diagnosis for gender dysphoria from a counselor, undergoing treatments under a doctors care, and meeting with a commanding officer to arrange a gender transition. The commanding officer would likely have broad discretion to approve a timeline for that transition, including delaying it based on the units needs. The transition would notably include changing a service members gender markers in the militarys medical and administrative systems. The policy would also establish timeframes when transgender service members are considered non-deployable like being unable to be sent to combat zones after beginning certain treatments or undergoing procedures, the sources said. Like those applying to the military, active service members would need to meet fitness standards corresponding with their gender identity, the sources said. However, military officials sometimes temporarily waive a fitness test for members with medical exemptions. The sources added that transgender service members could also be qualify for temporary waivers. Once a transgender service member enlists or an active member switches their gender, the sources said, the policy would likely require them to use housing, meet grooming standards, and and wear uniform consistent with their gender identity right away. Likewise, they would use restrooms and shower facilities reflecting their target gender. The Defense Department would likely require military branches to establish codes to implement these rules. Those rules could reflect standards already used among mixed-gender groups of service members. The policy is likely to include rules for keeping records of a persons birth sex private, so that transgender people are not inadvertently outed, the sources said. Likewise, there may be efforts to synchronize changes to various records all at once, so that inconsistencies between records do not reveal that a service member is transgender. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal agency that deals with employment discrimination law, has found discrimination on the basis of gender identity is illegal among government and civilian workers. But the agencys jurisdiction ends at the militarys door. The sources said the Defense Department would likely amend its Military Equal Opportunity policy, which currently bans discrimination on the basis of sex, to state that includes discrimination on the basis of gender identity. Gordon Trowbridge, a spokesperson for the Department of Defense, declined to comment on the details of the policy on Wednesday. He told BuzzFeed News, We hope to have something to tell folks soon about the work we have been doing since the secretarys announcement last July that he would look at this issue. 2.

aS'Here are some of the loudest queer voices currently working in the industry and why you should be paying attention to them. Larry Busacca / Getty Images Spa Night. Strand Releasing Andrew Ahn first got noticed for two short films: Andy in 2011 and Dol in 2012. The latter, which won the Grand Jury Award Outstanding Narrative Short Film at Outfest, Ahn said, was his way of coming out to his parents. His first feature-length film, Spa Night, debuted at Sundance Film Festival in 2016. It follows David (Joe Seo), who comes to terms with his sexuality as he explores the world of anonymous sex at L.A.s Korean spas. Ahn has said that his work deals with the intersection of Korean and gay culture. Where to start: Spa Night is certainly the steamier option, but Dol is very much worth your time (and its short!). Neilson Barnard / Getty Images Appropriate Behavior. Gravitas Ventures Inspired by her own experiences, Desiree Akhavans 2014 film Appropriate Behavior has the filmmaker playing an alternate version of herself, but she has maintained that, even though both she and her protagonist Shirin are bisexual Persian American women, it is not autobiographical. The movie follows Shirin as she struggles to balance a complicated relationship with her ex-girlfriend Maxine (Rebecca Henderson) and her sexual identity, including coming out to her conservative family. Where to start: Appropriate Behavior, but do check out her web series The Slope, co-created with Ingrid Jungermann (also on this list). Ian Gavan / Getty Images All About My Mother. Sony Pictures Classics Pedro Almodvars impressive career includes everything from farcical comedy to melodrama and women are, more often than not, front and center, though he has also frequently returned to the themes of queer desire, gender identity, and Catholicism (specifically, its subversion). Films like Talk to Her, All About My Mother, Bad Education, and Volver blend heavy subject matter (rape, abuse, incest) with camp and drag, a testament to the healing power of lip-synching. Where to start: Watch all of them is likely too daunting a prospect, though a worthwhile one. 1988s Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown is a good point of entry, but if you are looking for something a bit heavier, try 1999s All About My Mother. Jason Kempin / Getty Images Mysterious Skin. Tartan Films Hailed as one of the directors at the forefront of New Queer Cinema, Gregg Araki makes stylish films that dont sacrifice substance. Hes perhaps best known for his Teen Apocalypse Trilogy particularly its centerpiece, 1995s The Doom Generation but Arakis other work includes sci-fi college sex romp Kaboom, child sexual abuse drama Mysterious Skin, and underrated stoner comedy Smiley Face. In 2010, Kaboom was the inaugural winner of the Cannes Film Festivals Queer Palm, which celebrates LGBT film. Where to start: The Living End, which has been called (somewhat redundantly) the gay Thelma and Louise, is a unique look at queer rage in the face of AIDS and homophobia in the early 90s. Michael Loccisano / Getty Images But Im a Cheerleader. Lionsgate Jamie Babbit has worked steadily in film and television: In terms of the latter, shes helmed memorable episodes of Gilmore Girls, The L Word, Girls, and Looking, among others. But queer audiences know her most fondly known for her cult classic 1999 movie But Im a Cheerleader, in which Natasha Lyonne plays high school student Megan Bloomfield, sent to conversion therapy camp by her homophobic parents. Its an offbeat romantic comedy about sexual discovery that resonated with plenty of queer and questioning audience members looking to discover the same things about themselves. Where to start: But Im a Cheerleader Jamie Mccarthy / Getty Images Zal Batmanglij has been a frequent collaborator of writer and actor Brit Marling: The two co-wrote 2011s Sound of My Voice and 2013s The East, and co-created the TV series The OA, which premieres later in 2016 on Netflix. So far, Batmanglijs films have not been expressly queer in terms of content, but that doesnt detract from the start of his auspicious career. If the surname sounds familiar, it might be because Batmanglijs brother is Rostam Batmanglij, who co-founded Vampire Weekend (and is also queer). Where to start: Sound of My Voice didnt initially receive the same amount of attention that The East did, but is worth watching first. Jemal Countess / Getty Images The Kids Are All Right. Focus Features Lisa Cholodenkos biggest mainstream success to date is The Kids Are All Right, which stars Annette Bening and Julianne Moore as a married couple whose kids are interested in meeting their sperm donor father; but queer audiences first started paying attention with 1998s lesbian indie romance High Art. Although she hasnt made a feature-length film since The Kids Are All Right, Cholodenko directed the acclaimed HBO miniseries Olive Kitteridge, earning her an Emmy and a Directors Guild Award. Where to start: Chances are youve already seen The Kids Are All Right, but have you seen High Art? Because you really, really should. Dominique Charriau / Getty Images Lionsgate For gays who love musicals of which there are many, duh Bill Condon is a big deal. He wrote Chicago, wrote and directed Dreamgirls, and directed the new Beauty and the Beast, which hits theaters in 2017. Condon is also big among tweens (he did the last two Twilight films) and anyone with a fondness for late 90s Brendan Fraser (remember how good he looked in Gods and Monsters?). Thirst aside, Gods and Monsters is a significant exploration of queer identity, as is Kinsey. Where to start: Gods and Monsters, naturally. Tim P. Whitby / Getty Images Billy Elliot. Universal Pictures Although the title character in Billy Elliot, played by Jamie Bell, isnt queer, the film as a whole offers an exploration of gender and sexual identity it follows a boy who wants to be a professional ballet dancer. (And his best friend Michael, played by Stuart Wells, is gay.) Stephen Daldrys work also includes 2002s The Hours, which centers on queer women, and hes also been active in the theater: He helped bring Billy Elliot to the stage, and, in 2019, will translate the musical Wicked to film. Where to start: Billy Elliot. (Even if youve seen it already, nows a good time to revisit.) Rob Kim / Getty Images The Paperboy. Millennium Films Lee Daniels 2009 film Precious is a gorgeous, modern-day classic that must not be overlooked. And as bleak as it was at times, the movie offered hints of Daniels more playful, campy sensibility, which is on full display in the batshit crazy but totally delightful 2012 film The Paperboy. Daniels has carried much of that over to his smash-hit TV series Empire, which he co-created with Danny Strong. On the Fox series, Daniels has done the important work of exploring gay black male identity through the character of Jamal Lyon (Jussie Smollett). Where to start: Precious. But please also watch The Paperboy. Ian Gavan / Getty Images I Killed My Mother. Kino Lorber Quebecois auteur Xavier Dolan made his critically acclaimed debut film I Killed My Mother (Jai tu ma mre in the original French) when he was only 19. Since its 2009 release, he has remained prolific, making films that are dark, stylish, and thoroughly queer. Earlier in 2016, his most recent film Its Only the End of the World earned the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival, where he has previously won for I Killed My Mother, Heartbeats, Laurence Anyways, and Mommy. Where to start: I Killed My Mother may not be Dolan at his most refined, but its the perfect entry into his themes and aesthetic. Vince Bucci / Getty Images The Craft. Columbia Pictures Andrew Fleming may not have the name recognition of some of the other filmmakers on this list, but hes responsible for some beloved cult classics: 1996s The Craft, 1998s Dick, and 2008s Hamlet 2. (OK, Hamlet 2 may not be as fondly remembered as the others, but it deserves so much more love than it gets.) Flemings eclectic career has lately skewed more toward television, including episodes of Lady Dynamite, Younger, and Difficult People. While the majority of his work may not be expressly queer, his filmography reads like a list of things gay people love. Where to start: The Craft. (Also, please watch and spread the word about Hamlet 2.) Dimitrios Kambouris / Getty Images A Single Man. The Weinstein Company Given his background as a fashion designer, it was easy to underestimate Tom Fords directorial debut, 2009s A Single Man. But the film, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by iconic gay writer Christopher Isherwood, is a stunning adaptation with predictably gorgeous aesthetics that dont undermine its emotional potency. Colin Firth plays George Falconer, a college professor mourning the sudden death of his partner Jim (Matthew Goode) in 1960s Los Angeles. Ford will return to directing with Nocturnal Animals, which will be released this November. Where to start: A Single Man is the only option here, but its also a great one. Larry Busacca / Getty Images Home for the Holidays. Paramount Pictures Jodie Fosters directing career has been unusual, to say the least: Shes helmed four films spread out over 25 years, beginning with 1991s Little Man Tate. Her most recent movie, Money Monster, hit theaters in May 2016. Foster, who officially came out in 2013, has rarely focused overtly on queerness in her films, but 1995s Home for the Holidays gave us the ahead-of-its-time queer character of Tommy Larson, played by Robert Downey Jr. Its also worth noting that she directed the Orange Is the New Black episode Lesbian Request Denied. Where to start: Little Man Tate. Slaven Vlasic / Getty Images Yossi & Jagger. Strand Releasing Israeli filmmaker Eytan Fox has not shied away from controversial themes over the course of his career. In 2002s Yossi & Jagger, he told the story of two soldiers in love. (He picked up with the former in the 2012 sequel Yossi.) Perhaps more notably, his 2006 film The Bubble is a queer love story told against the background of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The film stars Yossi & Jagger lead Ohad Knoller as Noam, an Israeli reservist who falls for Palestinian activist Ashraf (Yousef Sweid). Where to start: Yossi & Jagger (with tissues). Charley Gallay / Getty Images Chutney Popcorn. Sundance Nisha Ganatras 1999 film Chutney Popcorn starred Ganatra herself as Reena, a lesbian Indian American woman struggling to reconcile her sexual identity with her cultural heritage. In the film, Reena becomes a surrogate for her sister Sarita (Sakina Jaffrey), which puts a strain on her relationship with girlfriend Lisa (Jill Hennessy). Since then, Ganatra has made a few more films, including 2003s Cosmopolitan, but has worked mostly in television. She has directed Mr. Robot and Shameless, and was producer director on the first season of Transparent, directing the season alongside creator Jill Soloway. Where to start: Chutney Popcorn Stefania D\'alessandro / Getty Images I Am Love. Mikado Film Luca Guadagnino has clearly found his muse in Tilda Swinton. The director and actor have collaborated on three films, 1999s The Protagonists, 2010s I Am Love, and 2015s A Bigger Splash. Swintons unique, androgynous beauty is well suited to Guadagninos lush films, which balance emotional honesty with sexual frankness. Guadagninos next movie, Call Me by Your Name, is about the relationship between a 17-year-old boy and an older, but still young man set in 1980s Italy, starring Timothe Chalamet and Armie Hammer. Where to start: I Am Love is gorgeous, but you might also be interested in Guadagninos earlier erotic drama Melissa P. Rommel Demano / Getty Images Mosquita y Mari. Wolfe Video Aurora Guerrero has had just one feature film in theaters: the 2012 movie Mosquita y Mari. Its a coming-of-age story about two teenage girls, Yolanda (Fenessa Pineda) and Mari (Venecia Troncoso), whose unlikely friendship becomes romantic. But beyond her filmmaking, Guerrero is also a passionate activist who co-founded Womyn Image Makers and has worked toward expanding opportunities for Latinos. Guerreros second feature, Los Valientes which has yet to be released is about a gay undocumented Mexican immigrant. Where to start: Mosquita y Mari Clemens Bilan / Getty Images Stranger by the Lake. Strand Releasing Alain Guiraudie has been making films, most of them queer-themed, since 1990, but his breakthrough came with his 2013 film Stranger by the Lake (LInconnu du lac in his native French). The film, which won the Queer Palm at Cannes, is a steamy like, unsimulated sex steamy thriller about Franck (Pierre Deladonchamps), who finds himself drawn to Michel (Christophe Paou) even after he witnesses him commit a murder at a remote cruising spot. Guiraudies most recent film, Staying Vertical, premiered at Cannes 2016. Where to start: Stranger by the Lake isnt for everyone, but on a purely shallow level, its at least worth it for the eye candy. Dave Kotinsky / Getty Images Weekend. Sundance Selects Andrew Haighs 2011 film Weekend is a gorgeous and grounded look at a 48-hour relationship between two men, played by Tom Cullen and Chris New. The movie, which picked up major awards at festivals including Outfest and SXSW, established Haighs minimalist, melancholy style that carried into his work on HBOs Looking. The subtle, character-driven series about gay men in San Francisco sadly went largely unappreciated over the course of its two-season run (but it will return with a movie in July 2016). On the plus side, Haighs last film, 45 Years, earned Charlotte Rampling an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. Where to start: Weekend. And then please give Looking another shot. Joshua Blanchard / Getty Images Carol. The Weinstein Company Todd Haynes has made some of the most significant queer films of the last 25 years 1991s Poison, his transgressive Jean Genet-inspired debut; 1998s Velvet Goldmine, with Jonathan Rhys Meyers as a bisexual glam rock god; 2002s Far From Heaven, in which he queers the traditional Douglas Sirk melodrama; and, most recently, 2015s Carol, a 50s-set romance between two women (Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara) that miraculously doesnt end in tragedy. Haynes work has repeatedly subverted expectations and shaped our modern conception of what queer cinema can be. Where to start: Poison or, hey, Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story, if you can find it. Cindy Ord / Getty Images The History Boys. Fox Searchlight Pictures Nicholas Hytner is probably better known for his work in theater than on film: He has directed 50 plays and musicals, including Miss Saigon, The History Boys, and a whole lot of Shakespeare, much of it for the Royal Shakespeare Company. On the film front, Hytner is responsible for the film adaptation of The History Boys, as well as 90s gay dramedy The Object of My Affection and cult classic Center Stage. His most recent film, 2015s The Lady in the Van, was adapted from a play he also directed. Where to start: The Object of My Affection, which is a little dated, sure, but still charming. Frederic J. Brown / AFP / Getty Images The Skeleton Twins. Roadside Attractions Craig Johnson broke through with 2014s The Skeleton Twins, which won him and co-writer Mark Heyman the Screenwriting Award at Sundance. The film stars Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig as fraternal twins Milo and Maggie, both struggling with depression. Johnson brought out impressive dramatic performances from his leads, both known primarily for comedy. Plus, The Skeleton Twins is notable for its exploration of the complicated relationship between Milo and the teacher he had an affair with in high school, played by Ty Burrell. Where to start: Yes, The Skeleton Twins. But also be on the lookout for his next film, Wilson, adapted from the Daniel Clowes graphic novel. Mireya Acierto / Getty Images Women Who Kill. Tribeca Film Festival Ingrid Jungermann co-created the web series The Slope with Desiree Akhavan, and more recently made the web series F to 7th, which shes currently developing for television. Women Who Kill, Jungermanns first feature, debuted at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2016; it stars the filmmaker as Morgan, who hosts a true crime podcast with her ex-girlfriend Jean (Ann Carr). The two crime obsessives soon begin to suspect that the new woman in Morgans life, Simone (Sheila Vand), is a murderer. Where to start: Women Who Kill hasnt been released yet, so if you missed it at Tribeca, youll have to be patient and tide yourself over with The Slope and F to 7th. Ben Gabbe / Getty Images Circumstance. Participant Media Iranian-American filmmaker Maryam Keshavarz has explored her heritage through her work, most notably in her 2003 documentary The Color of Love and the 2011 narrative feature Circumstance. The latter follows Atafeh (Nikohl Boosheri) as she experiments with sex and drugs and embarks on a relationship with another young woman in contemporary Iran. Circumstance has been banned in Iran and, more harshly, Keshavarz herself has been banned from returning to the country. Where to start: Circumstance, of course. Stuart C. Wilson / Getty Images Kill Your Darlings. Sony Pictures Classics John Krokidas first (and so far, only) feature was 2013s Kill Your Darlings, inspired by the true story of the college friendship between Beat Generation writers Allen Ginsberg (Daniel Radcliffe) and Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan), and the murder of David Kammerer (Michael C. Hall). The film was well received, and while Krokidas has not yet directed another feature, he has been directing television. He helmed two episodes of the short-lived series Black Box, as well as an episode of Wayward Pines. Where to start: Kill Your Darlings, but hopefully, there will be more. Pascal Le Segretain / Getty Images The Raspberry Reich. Strand Releasing Heterosexuality is the opiate of the masses, declares The Raspberry Reich, Bruce LaBruces 2004 film thats part-biting satire, part-gay porn. The Raspberry Reich isnt the only explicit LaBruce film: Most of his work incorporates unsimulated sex. (His more recent work, including 2013s cross-generational gay romance Gerontophilia, leaves out the graphic sex.) LaBruces movies are exciting, divisive, and radically queer. His confronting style may alienate some viewers, but thats part of his appeal. Where to start: Hustler White (not in public). H.P. Mendoza / Via Facebook: hpmendoza Fruit Fly. TLA Releasing H.P. Mendoza didnt direct 2006 cult film Colma: The Musical that was Richard Wong, with a screenplay and songs by Mendoza but he did helm the 2009 follow-up Fruit Fly. Both films are set in the San Francisco Bay Area, with a particular focus on the Asian-American and queer communities that Mendoza is part of. His movies are micro-budget features: Mendozas 2012 horror film I Am a Ghost was made for only $10,000, which was largely raised on Kickstarter. Where to start: I should say Fruit Fly, but actually watch Colma first, even though were technically focusing on directorial works. Jamie McCarthy / Getty Images Hedwig and the Angry Inch. Fine Line Features For those who werent lucky enough to see it onstage in its original off-Broadway run, John Cameron Mitchells 2001 film adaptation of his and Stephen Trasks rock musical Hedwig and the Angry Inch was an unforgettable introduction to the iconic Hedwig Schmidt. To many, it also offered their first taste of gender fluidity, as Hedwig exists outside of any traditional binary. Mitchell has continued acting he even played Hedwig again in the shows recent Broadway run and directed three more feature films, Shortbus (notable for its unsimulated queer sex), Rabbit Hole, and How to Talk to Girls at Parties, which will be released later this year. Where to start: Hedwig and the Angry Inch, of course. Tim P. Whitby / Getty Images Swimming Pool. Focus Features For the early part of his career, Franois Ozon was known mostly to only French audiences. He first began to crossover to American indie audiences with films like 2000s Water Drops on Burning Rocks (based on the Fassbinder play), 2002s 8 Women, and 2003s Swimming Pool. His movies frequently explore sexuality with a gloriously European lack of inhibition and queer themes, with his trademark darkly satirical sense of humor. Ozons last film, 2014s The New Girlfriend, was lauded for its subversion of gender. Where to start: Water Drops on Burning Rocks Alberto E. Rodriguez / Getty Images Boys Dont Cry. Fox Searchlight Pictures Kimberly Peirces debut feature Boys Dont Cry told the true story of Brandon Teena, a trans man who was murdered in a 1993 hate crime. The film raised awareness about trans identity, as well as violence against the trans community, and Hillary Swank won an Academy Award for her portrayal of Brandon. Since then, Peirce has made two other films, 2008s Stop-Loss (which she also wrote) and the 2013 remake of Carrie. In the documentary This Film Is Not Yet Rated, Peirce made an appearance discussing the MPAAs bias against representations of queer sex. Where to start: Boys Dont Cry Cindy Ord / Getty Images Pariah. Focus Features Dee Rees 2011 film Pariah, which she also wrote, is a coming-of-age story about 17-year-old Alike (Adepero Oduye) discovering and embracing her lesbian identity. Rees followed that up by co-writing and directing the 2015 HBO movie Bessie, a biopic about queer blues singer Bessie Smith (Queen Latifah). In addition to the period film Mudblood, Rees has been attached to the TV adaptation of Isabel Wilkersons The Warmth of Other Suns, which shes developing with Shonda Rhimes. Where to start: Pariah. Although, if you can find it, check out Rees documentary about her grandmothers return to Liberia, Eventual Salvation. Todd Williamson / Getty Images Canadian filmmaker Patricia Rozema has moved between Canada and the U.S., and between film and television. Her eclectic work includes the 1987 comedy Ive Heard the Mermaids Singing and the 1995 romance When Night Is Falling, both of which center on queer women. Rozema was responsible for the unconventional Jane Austen adaptation Mansfield Park, and she also directed episodes of Tell Me You Love Me and In Treatment. Her most recent film, the apocalyptic drama Into the Forest with Ellen Page and Evan Rachel Wood, will hit theaters in July 2016. Where to start: Ive Heard the Mermaids Singing, which was ranked as one of the top 10 Canadian films of all time by the Toronto International Film Festival. Gareth Cattermole / Getty Images Love Is Strange. Sony Pictures Classics Ira Sachs Love Is Strange was hailed as one of the most beautiful and poignant films of 2014: John Lithgow and Alfred Molina star as Ben and George, who face harsh financial realities after Ben is fired from his job as a Catholic school music teacher for marrying a man. Sachs explored a much more volatile same-sex relationship in his semi-autobiographical 2012 film Keep the Lights On, which details the effects of drug addiction on a young couple. Sachs latest film, Little Men, premiered at Sundance in early 2016. Where to start: Keep the Lights On, or perhaps Sachs first, ultra-indie film The Delta. Jason Merritt / Getty Images Humpday. Magnolia Pictures While Humpday isnt your traditional queer film its about two straight men its actually an interesting exploration of male sexuality and the homoerotic undercurrents of many male friendships, as Ben (Mark Duplass) and Andrew (Joshua Leonard) contemplate having sex with each other on camera for an art project. Shelton, who is bisexual, also explored the spectrum of sexuality in her 2011 film Your Sisters Sister, a far cry from the traditional romantic comedy. Her last film, Laggies, was released in 2014. Where to start: Humpday Daniel Zuchnik / Getty Images Crystal Fairy. IFC Films Sebastin Silva has made some delightfully weird films in his career so far, blending surrealism, comedy, and horror in works that defy easy categorization. Crystal Fairy follows Jamie (Michael Cera) in his search for a hallucinogenic cactus, while Magic Magic tracks the possibly supernatural breakdown of Alicia (Juno Temple) and both are set in Silvas home country of Chile. While his most recent film, 2015s Nasty Baby, appears more straightforward on the surface the film focuses on a gay couple, Freddy (Silva) and Mo (Tunde Adebimpe), trying to have a baby it takes a wild third-act twist that is pure Silva. Where to start: Watch Crystal Fairy and Magic Magic back-to-back. Frazer Harrison / Getty Images Dear White People. Lionsgate Justin Simiens debut feature Dear White People was a major success it earned Simien an Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay, among other accolades and with good reason. Its a pitch-perfect satire about racial tensions on a predominantly white college campus. Simien came out as gay at the Sundance premiere of the film, which has a queer protagonist, Tyler James Williams Lionel Higgins. Simien is now in the process of adapting Dear White People into a Netflix series, for which he will write the whole first season. Where to start: Dear White People Charley Gallay / Getty Images G.B.F. Vertical Entertainment Darren Stein is best known for his 1999 cult classic Jawbreaker, a deliciously dark comedy about a clique of mean girls that accidentally murder their best friend with the titular candy. More recently, he directed G.B.F., which is also a satirical high school movie but a lot less mean; it upends the concept of the gay best friend, exposing the way in which gay men can become commodities for their straight female friends. Jawbreaker fans, take note: Stein has written the book for a musical adaptation currently in the works. Where to start: Jawbreaker Larry Busacca / Getty Images Go Fish. MGM Rose Troches 1994 film Go Fish, which tells the love story between Max (Guinevere Turner) and Ely (V.S. Brodie), is a classic in queer cinema. Troches work has not always been as overtly LGBT-focused, but in an interview she did with The Advocate for the release of her 2001 film The Safety of Objects, she noted, Everything I do is informed by being queer. Shes had an active TV directing career, including work on Six Feet Under, The L Word, and, most recently, Finding Carter. Troches other recent work includes the virtual reality film Perspective; Chapter 1: The Party, a confronting look at sexual assault. Where to start: Go Fish (which is in black-and-white). Pascal Le Segretain / Getty Images Milk. Focus Features Gus Van Sant has had an impressive three-decade career as a filmmaker, with movies that run the gamut of genres and whose critical receptions have been equally varied. But his queer films are some of his most acclaimed, including 1991s My Own Private Idaho and his 2008 Harvey Milk biopic Milk, which received eight Academy Award nominations, with Dustin Lance Black winning for his screenplay and Sean Penn winning for his performance as the gay rights activist of the title. Van Sants most recent film, the more divisive The Sea of Trees, will be released by A24. Where to start: Drugstore Cowboy Stuart C. Wilson / Getty Images Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives. Strand Releasing Apichatpong Weerasethakul has made several lyrical, sensual films not without controversy. His 2002 movie Blissfully Yours was censored in his native Thailand for its graphic sex scenes, which include full-frontal male nudity. In most of his work, Weerasethakul has explored queer themes, which is particularly true with 2004s Tropical Malady, a winner of the Jury Prize at Cannes. But his best known film is 2010s Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives, which took home the Palme dOr, Cannes most prestigious award. Where to start: Blissfully Yours (the uncensored version). Charley Gallay / Getty Images Year of the Dog. Paramount Vantage Mike White is much more frequently a writer than a director his only film credit in terms of the latter is 2007s Year of the Dog but hes such a significant voice in queer film that it would feel wrong not to include him. Whites writing work includes the cringe-inducing Chuck & Buck, the pitch-black comedy The Good Girl, the oddball teen comedy Orange County, and, most accessibly, School of Rock. White also directed several episodes of Enlightened, Gay Twitters favorite gone-too-soon TV series, which he created and wrote every episode of. Where to start: Even though he didnt direct it, Chuck & Buck. CORRECTION Nisha Ganatra was the producer director on the entire first season of Transparent. A previous version of this post misstated her contribution to the show.

aS"Misty Snow the first out transgender nominee of either major party for Congress will face off against Sen. Mike Lee in November. View this image  Via Facebook: MistyKSnow WASHINGTON Utah Democrats on Tuesday voted for Misty Snow as their partys nominee for Senate, the first out transgender nominee for Congress from a major party. On Tuesday, Snow defeated Jonathan Swinton, described by the Salt Lake Tribune as a conservative Democrat and a 35-year-old Mormon marriage therapist. Snow, the more liberal challenger to Swinton, is described as a cashier at a grocery store currently. By early Wednesday, she had defeated Swinton 59.4%-40.6% in the returns, with all counties completed. The 30-year-old Snow will face an uphill battle in the conservative state to unseat Sen. Mike Lee one of the most conservative members of the Senate in the fall. On her website, she addresses her rare status as an out transgender person seeking office. There are some that claim that Utah is not ready for a candidate like me, but I strongly disagree. Utah is not only ready but in desperate need of a Senator exactly like me, Snow writes. We cannot wait for others to give us equality. We have to claim equality for ourselves. Derek Kitchen, a member of the Salt Lake City Council, told BuzzFeed News that hes met Snow previously a few times and was looking forward to her campaign. Her Republican opponent has a tight grasp on the senate seat, but Misty will hopefully bring a new kind of conversation to the table, he wrote. Im so thrilled that gender and sexuality are an afterthought in Utah politics, and I look forward to watching this race unfold. This is a dynamic time in political history, thats for sure, and Im so proud to bear witness to the changes. Kitchen would know. An out gay man, he was one of the plaintiffs in the successful challenge to Utahs marriage ban before running for and winning his council bid.

aS"The Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department said deputies responded to but could not substantiate Calum McSwiggans claim that he was attacked after leaving a gay club. Police later arrested him on a vandalism charge. [Update: McSwiggan was charged on Wednesday with filing a false police report.] View this image  The 26-year-old has more than 62,000 followers on YouTube. His most watched video I did Gay Porn & Im Sorry has racked up more than 400,000 views. He previously spoke with BuzzFeed UK about his porn experience. In many of his videos, the LGBT and Lifestyle YouTuber discusses mental and sexual health. He has also appeared in popular sex education videos, sometimes partnering with LGBT charities. After one of the most wonderful weekends at VidCon we went out to a gay club to celebrate, and towards the end of the evening I was separated from my friends and beaten up by three guys. The authorities should have been there to help and protect me but instead they treated me like a second class citizen. With three broken teeth and six stitches in my forehead, Ive never felt so terrified to be a gay man in the public eye. All I can do is thank my wonderful friends @riyadhk, @melaniiemurphy and @douga_ for being with me the whole way. Id be lost without them. Right now I dont feel that Im in the right place to talk about this but I will be addressing this fully in the future. It's daddy doug's last night tonight so we're taking him out for a whole bunch of mischief and nonsense  The above photo was posted to McSwiggans Twitter the same night of the alleged assault. McSwiggan added on Facebook that, at the moment, he doesnt feel in the right place to talk about the incident. I will be addressing this fully in the future, he concluded. The Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department has an affirmative duty to fully investigate all assaults and reports of violence in our community. Deputies from West Hollywood Station responded to and investigated the report by Calum McSwiggan that he was assaulted by three males after leaving a local nightclub early Monday morning. Responding deputies were unable to substantiate the assault. Mr. McSwiggan, who had no visible injuries, was subsequently arrested after deputies observed him vandalizing a car in the 8900 block of Santa Monica Boulevard. After being booked and photographed, Mr. McSwiggan was placed into a cell by himself at West Hollywood Station. Mr. McSwiggan was then observed injuring himself with the handle and receiver to a payphone inside the cell. Medical personnel were summoned and Mr. McSwiggan was transported to a local hospital for treatment. Mr. McSwiggans booking photo was taken prior to deputies seeing Mr. McSwiggan injuring himself.

aS"The proposed bill would create an optional registration system for transgender people who have sex reassignment surgery. View this image  House Speaker Tim Moore has been leading proponent of North Carolinas law that bans transgender people from public restrooms that match their gender identity. AP / Gerry Broome Republican leaders of North Carolinas House of Representatives have drafted legislation that would walk back an anti-LGBT law that was passed in spring after conversations with the NBA, according to a report Tuesday by WBTV. But LGBT advocates roundly blasted the draft bill in interviews with BuzzFeed News, saying it would actually exacerbate problems with the states existing anti-LGBT law which bans transgender people from public restrooms that match their gender identity. The proposed legislation would create a system by which transgender people who want to use restrooms that reflect their gender could obtain a state-issued certificate vouching for a sex reassignment surgery. But critics say that would amount to a government registration to use the restroom. This bill raises a whole new host of privacy concerns by establishing some sort of registry or government repository of private medical information about transgender people, Chase Strangio, a staff attorney for the ACLU, told BuzzFeed News. Strangio, who is litigating a case in federal court against North Carolina over the existing law, added the laws constitutional and civil rights violations would be in some ways reinforced by the draft bill. Its almost like they are doubling down on their transgender discrimination and their creepy fixation with the genital characteristics of trans people, he said. Hopefully people wont be fooled by this non-fix of the law. A draft of the bill is posted here. The NBAs position is of particular interest. WBTV reported the draft bill resulted from conversation between the NBA which had raised concerns about the existing law in the past and Republican state leaders. The station also reported the NBA may support the new bill. A person with knowledge of the leagues plans, who asked not to be identified to discuss details of the ongoing discussion surround the 2017 All Star Games future in Charlotte, said passage of the proposed legislation would be a big step in helping the league to make the decision to keep the game in Charlotte, WBTV said. The NBA did not immediately respond to requests from BuzzFeed News for comment. But LGBT advocates came out against it in force. Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, told BuzzFeed News the bill is a step backward. In fact, this bill hurts trans people more, she said, noting that many transgender people do not want surgery to change their sex. It still assumes that trans people are predators. They are not walking it back, they are pasting a bunch of fat-ass fig leaves on it. Meanwhile on Tuesday, the Human Rights Campaign condemned the legislation as a despicable bill and ridiculous proposal, while Freedom for All Americans said it isnt even a step in the right direction. It is unclear which Republican House leaders are behind the legislation. Speaker Tim Moore, who backed HB2, did not respond to BuzzFeed News request to comment on the proposals origins or his goals for it. For months, Moore and other GOP leaders in Raleigh have argued transgender people pose a safety threat to women in restrooms a claim without any documented support as the basis for passing HB2 the law. Apparently speaking to that issue, the draft bill would raise penalties for illicit behavior in restrooms by classifying them as felonies. As it stands in North Carolina, HB2 bans transgender people from using single-sex restrooms in government buildings and public schools corresponding with their gender, unless they have changed their birth certificate. Some states do not allow changes to gender markers on birth certificates while others, including North Carolina, require a person to get a gender-affirming surgery. In lieu of a birth certificate, the draft bill obtained by WBTV states that a transgender person could seek a notarized statement from a physician who has examined the individual to find he or she has obtained a sex reassignment surgery. The transgender person could then submit the doctors statement and an application to the state registrar, who would issue a certificate of sex reassignment. Still, lacking an enforcement mechanism in either the bill or the existing law, it is unclear how such a certificate would be used. The bill adds that state policies banning discrimination in employment would reflect federal civil rights law that bans discrimination, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. However, Moore and other top state officials have argued in federal court that civil rights law does not ban transgender discrimination. Further, the draft bill reiterates that requiring transgender people to use restrooms that match their birth sex does not constitute discrimination. Democrat Chris Sgro, the head of Equality North Carolina and a lawmaker in the state House, told BuzzFeed News that he believes Democrats who hold a minority in both chambers will be pretty resolutely opposed to this. I think that a transgender person should not have to register with the state of North Carolina to use the restroom he said, adding, This is not a fix. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The pope appeared to defend a liberal cardinal who caused a stir with remarks earlier this year suggesting same-sex relationships have worth. View this image  Handout Pope Francis said Sunday that the Church must not only apologize to a gay person it offended, but we must apologize to the poor, to women who have been exploited, to children forced into labor, apologize for having blessed so many weapons, the AP reported. The pope made the remarks aboard the papal plane when asked to comment on a call for an apology to gay people by German Cardinal Reinhard Marx, who also defended efforts to include language suggesting that might same-sex partnerships have worth in a document on family compiled during a worldwide consultation with bishops. The pope followed his statement by adding that he was not speaking of the Catholic Church as an institution, but rather, When I say the church: Christians. The church is healthy. We are the sinners. In the end, bishops rejected the language Marx initially proposed on homosexuality. Pope Francis statement on family issued in April, called The Joy of Love or Amoris Laetitia, restated existing church teaching: that every sign of unjust discrimination is to be carefully avoided against gays and lesbians, but that there are absolutely no grounds for considering homosexual unions to be in any way similar or even remotely analogous to Gods plan for marriage and family. While Pope Francis has largely avoided harsh language of LGBT people, there has been few signs that the church has moderated its opposition to secular laws concerning LGBT rights, and the pope has personally thrown his weight behind efforts to enacting laws that would block marriage equality.

aS"The EU has been an engine of change both within and outside of Europe what happens now that its splitting apart? View this image  A man carries a placard reading Stop Homophobia during the Gay Pride parade on June 12, 2016 in Kiev Sergei Supinsky / AFP / Getty Images European LGBT activists are concerned that Britains vote to leave the European Union will weaken a bloc that has been central to promoting LGBT rights in countries where politicians and popular opinion have been overwhelmingly on the other side. Activists from Ireland to Ukraine to Uganda are worried that the EU could be fundamentally compromised as an engine of change. A united EU voice has helped activists turn back anti-LGBT initiatives in countries on the European continent and beyond with the argument that they violate commitments under international human rights agreements. Now, with the UK voting to leave, they believe it has sent the signal that countries can walk away from multinational agreements when they no longer likes the rules. Given how important European institutions have been in promoting LGBT rights both in the region and worldwide, anything that puts a hold on European progress causes concern about advancement for rights for LGBT people, especially in countries that are lagging behind, said Brian Sheehan, a leader of the successful Irish marriage equality campaign who now co-chairs the European branch of the International Lesbian and Gay Association. In Europe, the most immediate test of the Brexits impact could come in non-member Ukraine, where the country has struggled to meet basic LGBT rights requirements for affiliation with the EU. It took the government several tries to pass an employment non-discrimination law that includes sexual orientation, a requirement of the EU for closer ties. Kiev also just held its first successful pride march after previous efforts had been blocked by right-wing groups. Now, said Olena Shevchenko of the Ukrainian LGBT rights group Insight, LGBT activists are worried that the few gains they have made in recent years could be lost. The Brexit vote is a very bad sign for Ukraine and for [the] whole of Europe, Schevchenko said in an email to BuzzFeed News. The EU is still [the] only instrument to push on our government to at least somehow protect LGBTI people and not to adopt same harmful legislation like it was done in Russia. If Ukraine understands the EU can be beaten, I think we will have lost our chance to push on our government. Social conservative activists inside the EU have already launched a challenge to the EUs generally supportive stance towards LGBT rights that could become much more serious in an environment where membership suddenly feels much more optional to its member states. In December, organizers began collecting signatures on an initiative called Mum, Dad, and Kids, which would petition the European Union to adopt legislation that would define marriage for its purposes to mean a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife. Family law is not something the EU technically has any jurisdiction over, but the backers of the initiative argue that the language is needed to prevent it from overreaching by pressuring states to adopt marriage equality or recognize same-sex unions established in other countries. The campaign is whats called a European Citizens Initiative, a relatively new mechanism created to bring a measure of democracy to EU institutions widely seen as unaccountable to the citizenry. If they get more than one million signatures by an April 2017 deadline, the EUs executive body will be required to formally consider the proposal but not to act. The European Commission summarily dismissed the first such initiative to clear the signature threshold, which would have restricted funding for stem cell research and family planning in foreign aid, and the organizers of Mum, Dad, and Kids warn that the Commission could create a profound crisis if it were to do the same following the Brexit vote. Precisely because of the Brexit vote, I think [the initiative is] a wakeup call to the Union, particularly the commission theres going to be accountability, said Roger Kika, a Slovakian lawyer who is vice president of the committee that brought the initiative and a former European representative of the U.S. conservative organization Alliance Defending Freedom. If the European Commission brushes aside the initiative and reinforces the impression that the EU is undemocratic, Kika said, things like the Brexit are going to happen again. Especially in Eastern EU member states where several states have enacted bans on same-sex marriage in the past 4 years anti-LGBT sentiment has contributed to the rise of anti-European parties, who argue they are fighting a attacks on national identity from an overreaching bureaucracy in Brussels. View this image  Activists of LGBT community shout slogans as they carry flags and placards during the Gay Pride parade on June 12, 2016 in Kiev Sergei Supinsky / AFP / Getty Images There is very much an East/West divide, said Maria Hildingsson, a Brussels-based Swedish activist who is one of the initiatives organizers, who noted Hungary and Poland recently vetoed regulations that would have included a requirement that even states that dont have recognize same-sex couples the property rights of same-sex unions performed in other EU countries. They are more conservative societies if you look at them, Hildingsson said. If we link this to what happened in the night with the Brexit there is really a feeling of frustration in Europe. You hear theres actually a gap between the political elite and the people. The UKs exit from the EU also has activists worried in English-speaking African countries, many of whom belong to the club of former British colonies called the Commonwealth of Nations. In countries like Uganda, which adopted a sweeping anti-LGBT law in 2014 that was nullified by the courts later that year, united pressure from donor nations for Uganda to respect international human rights principles was crucial to pushing back the legislation. I am very concerned, said Frank Mugisha of the group Sexual Minorities Uganda. We want strong advocacy for collective leadership on response to LGBTI rights within [the] EU; this is definitely going to be difficult. The Gambias longtime dictator Yahya Jammeh pulled the country out of the Commonwealth in 2013 shortly before intensifying anti-LGBT laws and launching mass arrests. Jammeh declared his country would not be party to any institution that represents an extension of colonialism, and the crackdown on LGBT rights was part of an effort to define his regime as upholding local religious traditions in the face of western powers. Now that Britain has walked away from the European Union, its going to be much harder for the UK to pursuade other anti-LGBT Commonwealth countries not to follow Jammehs example, said Fatou Camara, a Gambian dissident now living in the United States. This is the very reason why not just the Europeans, but also the rest of world was carefully watching this Brexit vote, Camara said. The Yahya Jammehs of this world will feel vindicated.

aS"Hate will always exist everywhere but this is the most equal Ive ever felt. View this image  Bryan R. Smith / AFP / Getty Images While love was the theme of the days festivities, the victims of the tragic mass shooting in Orlando on June 12 which left 49 dead and dozens more injured were on everyones mind. Were going to enjoy ourselves today for those who cant be here, Justine Santos, who said she came out to her family only recently, told BuzzFeed News at the beginning of the parade. The day kicked off with a moment of silence in honor of the victims. In a rare Manhattan moment, the streets fell completely silent. Moments later, the crowd broke out in deafening cheers as motorcycles at the front of the march roared their engines at the official start of the parade. View this image  Mary Ann Georgantopoulos / BuzzFeed News View this image  Mary Ann Georgantopoulos / BuzzFeed News As floats began crossing the start line a pedestrian crosswalk painted in rainbow colors the tributes for the victims of Orlando began. Signs such as We will not be silenced, We are Orlando, and Angels for Orlando were aplenty. Members of Gays Against Guns, a group created in the aftermath of the Orlando shooting, chanted for stricter gun laws. Hey, hey, ho, ho, these gun laws have got to go, members chanted as they paraded. Gays Against Guns believe homophobia and lax gun laws are a deadly combination for our community, according to their Facebook page. Mary Ann Georgantopoulos / BuzzFeed News Mary Ann Georgantopoulos / BuzzFeed News Mary Ann Georgantopoulos / BuzzFeed News Several spectators said the tribute was so emotional it brought them to tears. John Zolanowski, who was in town with his wife and four kids from San Diego, called this moment the most touching of the day. This is all about freedom for me, Zolanowski said. This is an exciting day because the gay community can have a major impact on all of our freedoms. The father of four remembers attending a pride parade in Boston in 1995 and recalls it being much smaller event. [The parade] is all about life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, he said. Its the perfect phrase to describe what today means. Zolanowski said it was important for him to bring his children aged 13, 11, 8, and 6 to teach them the importance of tolerance. When asked if he was having a good time at the parade, Zolanowskis young son, Jack, shyly responded, Yeah, as he clutched on to his pride flag. View this image  From left: Marquist Ware, Linus Osorio, Casey Jensen, Joseph Alexiou Mary Ann Georgantopoulos / BuzzFeed News This parade is everything to me, he said. Hate will always exist everywhere but this is the most equal Ive ever felt . What happened in Orlando is not going to scare us away. Jensens friend Joseph Alexiou, who is from New York, agreed that this years parade felt different. It feels like today even the most cynical came out in support of the [LGBT] community, he said. Linus Osario, who is from Miami and visiting New York with Jensen, said a few years ago he might have hesitated to wear a gay-friendly T-shirt freely on the subway, but today he wore it with pride. Its fucking awesome to be welcomed, he said. View this image  Mary Ann Georgantopoulos / BuzzFeed News Theres a lot of pain with this years pride parade, he said. Were hoping the colors will replace the pain. Allen, who is from Brooklyn, said the communitys resilience following the Orlando attack was evident in the sheer number of people who came out to march in the parade and cheer from the sidewalks. Its an act of defiance, he said of not letting fear stop people from attending the parade. You can attack us but were not going to shy away. We are unapologetically here. Scenes from today's Pride parade Being a member of the community, this is an awesome celebration, including allies of every color, race, and ethnicity under the sun, Shannon Weaton said. Weaton admitted she felt a bit nervous about attending this years parade given what happened in Orlando. Our existence is resistance, she said. Im not going to let bigotry win. View this image  Mary Ann Georgantopoulos / BuzzFeed News Nicole Spano said it was important for her to come to the parade as she recently came out and wanted to celebrate with her first girlfriend, Quinn Vaticino. Im so excited because Im around people that have the same values as me, she said, while hugging Vaticino, and stealing a quick kiss. 9.

aS"Yes, that one. All the spoilers ahead youve been warned. View this image  In The Animals, the penultimate episode of Season 4 in the Jenji Kohan series, Samira Wileys character is killed off in a scene that calls attention to the Black Lives Matter movement and echoes circumstances surrounding the deaths of Eric Garner in New York City and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. In the final minutes of the episode, a peaceful protest put on by the Litchfield inmates over CO Piscatellas inhumane treatment goes awry, leading to CO Baxter Bayley (Alan Aisenberg) restraining Poussey on the ground with his knee placed squarely on her back. Distracted by the commotion, the guard fails to notice he is applying so much pressure she can no longer breathe. Poussey even uses Garners own words, struggling to shout out I cant breathe before losing consciousness. Taystee (Danielle Brooks), Pousseys closest friend throughout the series, is instantly by her side as the episode comes to a close. View this image  View this image  In an interview with Vulture, Wiley said keeping this secret from her castmates and friends was one of the hardest things shes ever had to do. Youre on a show for so long and you feel a part of it and then, all of a sudden, you get news like this, and its a real shock, Wiley said. I definitely needed the time and am grateful and thankful for all the executive producers being able to understand how delicate and sensitive this situation was. They made sure I was okay throughout the whole process. View this image  Wiley described the moment to The Hollywood Reporter as being filled with wine and tears. Im so grateful that I was able to have that night with them. It was really special to just be able to sit down and talk to each other and let them know some finality was coming ahead, Wiley said. It was almost like a movie, our jaws dropped simultaneously, Aduba told Variety. We were just aghast and agape and couldnt believe it. Ben Gabbe / Getty Images Wiley didnt find out her actual girlfriend would be writing the episode right away, but told The Hollywood Reporter she felt safe with the story in Morellis capable hands. I knew that she would take so much care, I knew that she understood the magnitude and the impact that we could have with the story we were trying to tell, Wiley said. Our relationship started as a professional relationship and I admire Laurens work as a writer, Im such a fan of hers from the beginning. So I again felt so honored to be able to have Lauren write the final episode of Poussey in prison. When Morelli finished the first draft of the scene, she burst out in tears. There was something in the actual writing of that paragraph that tore me apart. So when I got to set, I had done my grieving, the writer told the New York Times. View this image  Samira Wiley descibed the emotions on set that day to Vulture: We had to do that scene on a special day, a Sunday, because they wanted everybody there. You want to see everybodys face that youve seen from the beginning when you have a moment like this on a show with a character thats been there from the beginning. It was actually pretty fun. We hadnt had a day like that on set since maybe first season, when we were all in there rapping together in a circle. The weepfest and crippling behind-the-scenes heartbreak of knowing that we were shooting Samiras last days, it was like sitting vigil for our favorite person, Natasha Lyonne, who plays Nicky Nichols, told THR of the casts reaction to Pousseys death. Samiras not just a fan favorite, shes our favorite. View this image  I was hanging out on the floor in between takes because they made this little thing for me so he could lean on my back and not hurt me for real because Im actually really tiny. He would have for real hurt me, Wiley said in an interview with Vulture. View this image  I would be hanging out there, they would stop the take, and people would get all emotional, the actor continued. Id just run around and make jokes and try and break the ice because its hard. When everybody around you is sad, I do the opposite. I gotta cheer people up. Even though Im the one thats gone, I was cheering people up. Netflix Netflix At the end of the day, I honestly feel pretty honored to be able to be the person or the character or the actor they entrusted with the responsibility of bringing this story to light and bringing this story to a bunch of people in whatever parts of America or whatever parts of the world where this hasnt really permeated their world yet, Wiley added in her Vulture interview. View this image  [Mulgrew] sent me an email after she read the script and said she needed to have me over for dinner, Wiley told the New York Times. It was me, her, Taylor [Schilling] and Uzo. We had a night and it was beautiful, and we cried and we ate amazing food and we drank wine. And I dont know who would have known I needed exactly that other than Kate. Netflix As Wiley told Vulture: We were on set and we were doing it over and over, and then somebody comes over and theyre like, Jenji said look in the camera. Im like, Jenji said what?! She aint say that. I thought they were playing with me. And they were like, No, she wants you to look straight into the camera. I was like, This is ridiculous, because we had done it a lot of times just me looking off. I was like okay, this is just the genius of Jenji Kohan, I guess Ill do this and then shell see or everybody will see later it dont work. But no, they obviously used it. 10.

aS"Soon, anyone who is qualified will finally be able to serve our great nation, regardless of their gender identity, said Ashley Broadway-Mack, the president of American Military Partner Association. View this image  Defense Secretary Ash Carter. AP / Carolyn Kaster The Department of Defense is expected to end its ban on transgender service members serving openly in the U.S. military on July 1, according to USA Today. Multiple other media reports confirmed that the long-sought change is to happen in July. Details of the new policy remain unclear, but an LGBT military group that has been fighting for the change was quick to applaud the news. Our transgender service members and their families are breathing a huge sigh of relief, said Ashley Broadway-Mack, the president of American Military Partner Association. Last July, Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced that officials would update outdated regulations and ordered a six-month review of the policy. Soon, anyone who is qualified will finally be able to serve our great nation, regardless of their gender identity, Broadway-Mack continued. We are eagerly anticipating the details of this historic announcement, and we are incredibly grateful for the leadership Secretary Carter has shown in getting us to this critically important point for our military families. The group estimates that there are 15,500 transgender service members currently serving. The American Medical Association approved a resolution in 2015 that stated there is no medically valid reason to exclude transgender individuals from service in the U.S. military. The Department of Defense and White House did not independently confirm a timeline to lift the ban to BuzzFeed News. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

AP Images for Human Rights Campaign / Diane Bondareff After protecting more than 265 million acres of land since becoming president most of it wilderness Obama signed a proclamation Friday morning to protect a tiny piece of the countrys biggest city: 7.7 acres in Manhattan. The president designated the site of the Stonewall Riots, where LGBT people pushed back against a police raid on the Stonewall Inn on June 28, 1969, as the first national monument to LGBT rights. The riots became protests, Obama said in a video announcing the Stonewall National Monument. The protests became a movement. The movement ultimately became an integral part of America. View this image  A sign hanging inside the Stonewall Inn. BuzzFeed News / Dominic Holden Stonewall will be our first national monument to tell the story of the struggle for LGBT rights, he continued. I believe our national parks should reflect the full story of our country the richness and diversity and uniquely American spirit that has always defined us. That we are stronger together. That out of many, we are one. On Friday afternoon, dozens of pilgrims who had come to New York City for the citys LGBT pride celebration which commemorates the Stonewall Uprising milled about the new monument. Marta Acedo had come from Seattle with her granddaughter and daughter, who was born in New York City month before the Stonewall riots. I am a lesbian, Acedo told BuzzFeed News, explaining her gratitude for the president honoring the spot where she stood. For me, its a recognition that we are part of the fabric of this nation. Melanie Ojwang, 22, was visiting from Maryland with three friends from various states who had sought out the Stonewall Inn. She believed Obamas willingness to recognize the LGBT community comes in part from the fact that hes black, even if hes not gay. As a minority, he recognizes other minorities that they need a safe space and that need to be acknowledged, Ojwang said. Given that the other presidents were old white men, they may not have recognized the struggle of minorities. Obama can still connect to someone being oppressed. View this image  Melanie Ojwang, Tyler Rutherford, Jade Stevensen, and Emmalee Smith on Friday. BuzzFeed News / Dominic Holden The monuments boundary encompasses Christopher Park, the Stonewall Inn, and the surrounding streets and sidewalks reflecting the same boundaries of the existing Stonewall National Historic Landmark established in 2000. Under the new designation, only the park itself will become federal land, managed by the National Park Service. Designating sites as national monuments, which can only be created on federal land, permanently protects the location. Federal landmarks, in contrast, can be privately-owned properties subject to changes by the owners. In his proclamation, Obama reflected on the how the LGBT movement advanced after the Stonewall Uprising, saying, Hard-fought civil rights victories in courtrooms and statehouses across the country set the stage for victories in the Supreme Court that would have seemed unthinkable to those who rose up in Greenwich Village in June 1969. Today, communities, cities, and nations celebrate LGBT Pride Days and Months, and the number of Pride events approaches 1,000. View this image  Rep. Jarrold Nadler BuzzFeed News / Dominic Holden Rep. Jerrold Nadler, who represents Manhattans west side in Congress, helped lead the effort to designate the monument. Sitting on a bench in Christopher Park, he told BuzzFeed News, Im glad we got it done in time for the parade coming by on Sunday. You have to push to get this into the school books, and we will, he said. The fact that the federal government declared this a monument will help even eventually Texas will have to explain why. youtube.com View this embed   Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

View this image  The flyers, authorised by Inverloch, Victoria, man Patrick Shea and put together by the Australian Family Association and the National Civic Council, says the LGBTI Safe Schools anti-bullying program sexualises and confuses Aussie kids. Trish Hackney-Westmore is the daughter of National Civic Council president Peter Westmore. She told BuzzFeed News the flyer made her and her wife Christy very upset and very angry. I would hope that the community would see that and think Thats extreme, thats untrue, what horrible things to say, she said. View this image  Supplied Hackney-Westmore said her fathers connection to the flyers was incredibly painful, but she felt compelled to speak up about them. This is obviously something thats incredibly difficult, she said. But its about Christy and I feeling like we have a responsibility to speak up and say Its not OK. It states Labor wants kids taught that transgender boys can use girls change rooms. However, the Safe Schools program actually advocates transgender boys be allowed to use boys facilities, rather than having to use those for girls. The flyer also says schools can decide that parental consent is not needed for a student having gender transition medical treatment. To receive cross-sex hormones treatment, a transgender person aged under 18 must get permission from the Family Court, a process typically involving supporting testimony from medical professionals and parents. Schools have no say in the matter.

aS"I hope when people who feel left out because of their gender expression see this post, theyll feel like were honoring them. - Jeffrey Marsh GQ Magazine Cosompolitan View this image  View this image  View this image  When I was little, we would play Spice Girls in school, and I always wanted to be Ginger but my friends would always tell me I had to be Scary because I was black. It was upsetting for me as a 6-year-old, but as I got older I started to think, Why would I want to be anyone other than Scary? Scary is clearly the best Spice Girl! So my emotional relationship with Scary Spice is weird, because initially I was forced into a particular role due to my race and appearance, but ultimately I ended up celebrating that I resembled her. Scary Spice is badass, gorgeous, and has a great personality! View this image  A lot of discussions around trans lives are so heavy, because the state of the world right now for trans people is so upsetting. Were in a crisis. I get caught up in it its overwhelming. But for this shoot, I wanted to do something lighthearted; I very purposefully chose a fun person to be, and chose to let myself be joyful. I want to show that not everything about being trans is depressing, because its not we are multifaceted people, we live full lives, we like to sing karaoke to the Spice Girls, we like to wear leopard print and cute makeup, we like to be nostalgic, we like to have a good time, we are happy and sad and everything in between and beyond! We deserve to celebrate our lives and ourselves. This experience really clicked for me once the makeup was done and I was in costume. The makeup was so spot-on, which I wasnt necessarily expecting, because normally on photo shoots, my look is kept pretty natural but seeing this transformation, I looked damn good! It helped me channel Scary Spice and get great photographs. View this image  View this image  I was just starting to physically transition when David Beckhams initial H&M campaign came out. When I saw it, something crystallized for me around that experience and other experiences Id had, in which I wasnt sure whether I desired him or desired to be him. I felt the floodgates opening both in terms of my attraction to men, which I hadnt understood before, as well as an understanding of the image being aspirational. I wanted my body to look like that at the time, but now, several years into transitioning, I recognize that this and other models of cis white masculinity that Ive been attracted to arent really how I see myself. Thats why it was important to me to wear nail polish in this photo, and to not pack: I identify as non-binary and as femme (although Im a transmasculine person, so the world generally reads me as male), so I wanted to call into question this particular model of masculinity, and to demonstrate the ways in which I both am privileged in how I conform to it, as well as the ways I feel tension against it. View this image  Having experienced extremely hateful transphobia around my body, which I dont have dysphoria about I dont feel uncomfortable with my lower half at all but still having been discriminated against, harassed, and assaulted because of my body made me want to put it out there and be like, Hello world, this is me, this is my junk! I dont have what people culturally consider to be a penis, and I feel totally fine with that! It was a reclamation after some of the shit Ive been through. And you know what? I think my butt looks awesome. Its not often that trans folks get to celebrate their bodies, so seeing these pictures of myself was a wonderful moment of getting to feel proud. View this image  View this image  I dont see brown masculinities like me in the media, so Bruno Mars was the only choice I had, aside from some obscure chefs. I was like, Let me find a chunky Asian guy with disabilities, and there were none! So I said, Lets find a Filipino guy! And I found a half-Filipino, half-Puerto Rican guy whose soulful tunings are some of my favorites. Close enough! View this image  Bruno Mars is a short, big-haired, Filipino man. Since he was a child, hes been performing in front of crowds, which is something I really identify with. I love that hes all about sharing his heartbreak, and I feel like he understands the sources and roots of music honors black artists, and honors Motown and R&B in ways that a lot of musicians dont. So Im like, OK, Bruno, you cute; Ill sing your songs in karaoke and dress like you and wear a little pompadour and do my people proud. It was hilarious to pose like him! I felt like his uncle. On a more serious note, I wanted to make sure my cane made it into this photo. I feel like its important as a disabled person to have these opportunities and feel cherished and good in your body, and embrace glam and glitz, and get comfortable being photographed. I understand that some folks arent, but I had a really good time. I feel like it was funny and heartwarming to be Bruno Mars for the day. Well see what he thinks of the mustache. View this image  View this image  Madonna and I are both strong women who are trying to make a difference in the world. Were both Leos, and I feel like we both share characteristics when it comes to pursuing our dreams: Were very driven, very ambitiousand very blond! I wanted to recreate this look from her Blond Ambition Tour because its maybe her most recognizable one, and at that time it was incredibly provocative. I loved the way she mixed extremely feminine lingerie with masculine elements like suiting, playing with traditional symbols of gender. View this image  When a lot of mainstream media covers trans issues, they dont actually let trans people speak. But we need to give trans voices a platform; only a trans person can say what a trans persons life is like. I host a web series called Spill the T With Vikki Le, where I feature trans people who can talk about their own journeys and experiences. I want to create an outlet that people can relate to. View this image  View this image  David Bowie had so many amazing looks that it was hard to choose one, but theres such a beautiful simplicity to this particular photograph. I love how quiet and contemplative it is; so much of my gender expression is about being bubbly and ostentatious, so this felt like a nice change. But I still wanted to engage with the artistic, creative spirit of it, so we decided to overemphasize my lips and lashes and eyebrows. Whatever you do, making it yours is so important. View this image  I had a little hesitation coming into this shoot, between wondering if this was the right way to honor David Bowie and having learned about things in his personal life that complicate his legacy, but the fact is I never knew him as a person. What I know about David Bowie is what he put into the world as someone who opened the doors to diverse expressions of gender. His expression felt like freedom to me; he shook the world I had been living in, where no one expressed their gender at all differently. When I first saw him in Labyrinth, I really didnt like it but I understand now that I was just reacting strongly to someone who was free in a way that I wasnt. He depicted something I wanted so badly, but I had so much internalized shame at the time around being a femme person, and I know Im not alone in that. There are so many people who are raised as boys and men who have that desire and that shame, but David Bowie opened up the possibilities for us. View this image  View this image  I have always admired Prince because of his musical talents and capabilities. I recall, as a child, dancing with my mother to his albums. When I was introduced to his videos on MTV, his visual aspects deeply appealed to me as well. He was no longer just another great musician; his personality, his movement through space and time, his aesthetic, and the way he fashioned himself resonated with me. I applauded his challenging the status quo. As a black man, he embraced femininity despite any derision, and I dont know of many black men who were respected for breaking all the rules. He transcended gender and I idolized him because of it. View this image  What I like most about this particular photo is Princes vulnerability. He is bare and exposed for viewing, inviting both our praise and scrutiny. Despite his vulnerability, he also displays uninhibited confidence its almost as if hes giving gender expectations a huge middle finger. I find him to be both feminine and masculine, threatening and nonthreatening. Also, I believe omitting his nipples from the photo plays a bit into his androgyny (though for this photo, I chose to show my nipples and scars). For many years, I have wanted to portray Prince in a photo series, and I am thrilled to have this opportunity, in the wake of his death, to hopefully live up to the colorful soul that is Prince. Im not a woman. Im not a man. I am something that youll never understand. Prince, I Would Die 4 U View this image  View this image  As a trans man, its been kind of hard for me to find men who I can even aspire to be, because I feel like our definitions of masculinity and what is attractive are being really tall and buff, and in a trans body, thats hard to attain. So Im always looking for different representations of masculinity in celebrities. I feel like Zayn definitely brings masculinity, but its stylish and alternative its the kind of masculine that I want to be. So I look up to him as a fashion icon. View this image  It was really validating for me to step into Zayns shoes. Something I struggle with as a trans person is feeling attractive as a man, so being transformed into him, knowing how many people find him attractive, and seeing myself looking like something I really like to see was so exciting. I felt so confident. Im working on getting my own confidence, but getting hair and makeup helps! I hope that this post shows the humanity of trans people that were just people like everybody else, and we have celebrity icons, and style, and we can be attractive too. I hope it humanizes us. View this image  View this image  I remember watching Juno when I was a teenager, and being totally captivated by Ellen Pages presence; there was this angst in her performance that really resonated with me, which I started to recognize later on was probably related to my being trans. Her role in Gaycation is kind of strange to me because of the overtones of colonialism, but the truth is, you can have good intentions and be super problematic. Allies can; I know I can in my allyship to others. Were all human. So it doesnt diminish the aspects of Ellen that are still meaningful to me, and I still appreciate her as a huge celebrity whos bringing attention to the queer umbrella. It was fun being made into a different kind of girl for this shoot. Although Im sure Ellen is wearing makeup in this photo, its a very natural, minimal look which is something she as a cis woman is able to do without much consequence. As a trans girl, I cant do that without my womanhood being questioned. I have to work so much harder to conform to even the absolute baseline of what society sees as feminine. View this image  I dont see cis as aspirational; I think being trans is pretty cool! That said, I have to really be prepared to go outside without foundation that covers the shadow on my jaw or my lip, because I will get stares and comments. Which in a way I care about less and less in general, I have more important shit to do than worry about whether you think Im a real woman or not but I and other trans women still have to stay safe. Especially trans women of color; that I have the option of sometimes saying, Fuck it, I dont care enough to wear makeup today is in itself a privilege. And in our current political climate, things exist like the trans panic defense, which is still legally admissible in almost every state. Its absurd and terrifying. I was going out the other day all made up in a skirt, and a contractor whos been working in my building for the past month Sir-ed me. In ways, its never going to be enough for society, no matter what you do; theyre always going to find a way to locate the boy that they think is just lurking under the surface. Clearly I dont believe womanhood is a costume that you just get to put on. What Im saying is, no amount of makeup is going to legitimize you in most peoples eyes so present in whatever way for you, not for them. View this image  View this image  There arent a whole lot of representations of Asian men in the media who are allowed to be sex symbols; the roles are really limited, and in terms of the way people are presented, theres a certain archetype of what an Asian man is supposed to be. And then as a trans guy, its hard to find representations of masculinity in the media that I identify with, much less ones that arent centered in whiteness. But Eugene embodies a type of masculinity that I really identify with: Hes sexy and vulnerable and comfortable in his own skin no matter what all of these things that are really refreshing to see in representations of masculinity in general, but especially for an Asian man. View this image  I am such a believer in the power of costume. Once the suit was on and the hair was done, I was like, OK, I can be a sexy guy now. It became really easy to go with that it felt natural in front of the camera to roll with that Eugene-esque attitude. View this image  View this image  There arent many models of Latinx femininity that I could think of (or relate to) in the mainstream. I chose Frida because she is one of the few brown women whos easily recognizable to many folks. Also, because I love her. I appreciate Frida because of her radical political background, her gender-bending nature, her queerness, her public suffering and endurance, her art and her oddity. View this image  When I see Frida, I think of my sisters and I think of my mother. This photo shoot allowed me to step into the shoes of all these women Frida, my sisters, my mother and feel a deep solidarity with them. When embodying Frida, I could feel all of their love and their pain. View this image  View this image  I love Kendrick Lamars music his artistic style of mixing jazz and other influences and his message. I got a record player and bought his first album on vinyl, and it changed my life. His Rolling Stone cover is iconic, and I cant deny that I love his hair in it. Up until then, hed kept it short, but growing out his natural black hair felt like a statement. Though this was my first time modeling, Ive spent plenty of time on the other side of the camera as a filmmaker. Kendricks a short black guy with a whole lot of talent, and I like to think thats me too. View this image  Its unfortunate that its 2016 and we still need to say these things, but trans and gender-nonconforming and LGBT folk are people too. Were not monsters; we love music and movies and have icons like everyone else. Were not out to set an agenda. We just want to live. View this image  View this image  Robert Eads was a trans man someone who was assigned female at birth, and identified and lived as a man. Later in life, he ended up developing ovarian cancer. He sought the care of almost two dozen different doctors, who all told him it would be an embarrassment to treat someone who was transgender, or that it would make their other patients feel uncomfortable. By the time he finally found a doctor who was willing to treat him, the cancer had spread so much and progressed so far that it was no longer treatable, and he ended up passing away. Im a social worker in the medical field. One of the reasons I went into my line of work is because our medical system is so binary: cis male and cis female. You hear about Robert Eads and you want to say, Well, this is something that happened a really long time ago. But it was in the late 90s, and its something that still happens today theres still not a lot of room for folks with diverse gender experiences. So in my work, I want to help make sure its something that doesnt continue to happen. That kind of prejudice is an experience I know that Ive had, my friends have had, people I love have had. If you dont feel healthy and well within yourself, how can you move forward to live your most authentic and fulfilled and wonderful, happy life that you want and deserve? View this image  Robert Eads documented the last year of his life in a film called Southern Comfort. Its such a profound film to watch; his sense of forgiveness to the providers who couldnt find it within themselves to treat him is really powerful. He says multiple times in the film, I dont blame them. But he does blame the binary system of gender that we hold so dear, thats taught people to put others into these incredibly rigid boxes. Thats a lesson I try to hold within myself: not blaming individuals, but thinking about the larger system that has informed ways of thinking. We need to fight that system, not that individual. I think were at such a fantastic point that we can say to ourselves, were looking to move beyond these systems and these boxes, and were looking to reshape them. Talking about stories like this, and making sure they dont get forgotten, is one way of doing that. View this image  View this image  I grew up listening to Lauryn Hills music, and I feel like I grew up with her kind of in the family. She reminds me of my mother, my sisters, and my aunts; like her, were from a West Indian background. My family went through a very tumultuous time right around when The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill was released, and I can remember being in my mothers car at the time and hearing Lauryns music on the radio, and feeling so connected to it. View this image  I have such a deep appreciation for her music lyrically and spiritually. She has always inspired me to create music, art, and poetry that is truthful and authentic to who I am and my experiences. Shes affected me greatly, and I know thats the case for a lot of trans women, especially of color. So whether or not she agrees with how I identify, I think she deserves homage and recognition for her work its inspired so many people. View this image  View this image  I was a fan of Queen since I was a little kid, and Freddie Mercurys death was when I learned about HIV and AIDS. I grew up in a fairly conservative area, and I witnessed the stigma people have around HIV and AIDS, and being gay, and all around different ways of living, and I understood that Freddies otherness was connected to mine in some way. I always loved his music and style. As someone whos transmasculine, I know theres a relative ease that comes with embracing more traditional masculinity but Freddie Mercurys expression of flamboyance even as a cis man is something I kind of aspire to. What also resonates with me about him was how separate his onstage persona was from his family and personal life. He was actually a very shy person, but his stage presence was so extroverted! When you see his performances, you can tell hes kind of leaving it all on the stage. And that was helpful to keep in mind while I was being photographed; I was feeling kind of self-conscious at first, but I realized I could take a lesson from him and go all out in the moment. View this image  Ive heard people say that being trans is so in right now, how everyone wants to be trans now. But at the same time, we have laws and environments like whats going on right now in North Carolina, where people are struggling with a new form of diversity in their lives beyond having to deal with racism and sexism and homophobia, and are scared because they cant comprehend whats going on. Its extremely isolating for trans people. They dont feel affirmed, they dont have proper access to health care, they cant even use public bathrooms without feeling other peoples hatred or disdain these things take a toll. And then when trans people have a high rate of suicide and attempts, they call us psychotic? I hope this will be a call to action. Being an ally isnt just saying, Well, I dont have any problem with trans people, and thats it. You have to make space for us, because weve been in the margins for so long. Allow us to speak for ourselves. Dont speak over us; if our voices arent loud enough, amplify them. I hope people see this article and understand, OK, I see who these people are. Theyre people like me. They have needs, just like I do. And then recognize that the differences between us arent only not a problem; acknowledge that you can exist alongside that difference, and that its a part of your life too. View this image  View this image  I love Grace Jones for her music, but even more so for her style and her absolute lack of fucks to give. She doesnt seem to care about the gender binary or societal pressures. I grew up in a pretty religious environment, so my gender and expression were policed pretty intensely; but watching Grace, the possibilities felt limitless. View this image  I love the glam, paparazzi feeling this shot gives off, and how fierce she looks in it: She has some very traditionally feminine features, but also such strength in her jaw and shape. Shes wearing almost the least amount of clothing possible, and while our bodies are kind of on opposite ends of the spectrum from each other, neither is the typically prized feminine body. Like her, Im an artist; I work in fashion, music, acting, drama, and writing, all to take my feelings and translate them into something that will change the social stigma around black, queer, fat bodies. To wear this little clothing in the skin Im in, I feel, is a strong statement. View this image  View this image  When I was growing up, Wonder Woman was on in the afternoons. In the summertime, I would go into the woods near my house and pretend to be her; so I have this spiritual affinity for Lynda Carters interpretation of that character. It wasnt until I grew up that I found out about the sociopolitical history and feminist elements of the show; as a kid, I was just attracted to how a human being could be both so powerful and so glamorous at the same time. There was no sacrifice in either of those two areas; she was perfectly pretty and feminine, as well as perfectly self-assured and ready to save the day. So stepping into her shoes was liberating, and it was empowering to see what becomes possible with costume and hair and makeup the sort of magic of transformation. Which is something I employ in my personal life whenever I wear things that make me feel good, but to do it in such a theatrical way was so affirming for the child whos still inside me, the child who wanted to be Lynda when they grew up. View this image  So often portrayals of trans people are so serious, and there are a lot of serious things that we need to accomplish as a movement; but its wonderful too to participate in a project with such fun and lightness to it, that shows a side of gender expression thats playful. I hope it will help a lot of people feel good about who they are. I still get messages almost every day from people who feel like theyre suicidal, who feel like theyre left out because of their gender expression, and because of the way they wish they could present themselves, but cant because of their school or their parents or their church groups. I hope when those people see this post, theyll feel like were honoring them as well as the heroes weve chosen for our photographs.

After nearly two years of humiliation and intense struggle, equality has finally prevailed. Now hopefully other transgender individuals will not have to face this type of discrimination. The cases underlying legal questions have not been resolved, however, and will continue to be litigated in federal courts. Grimm had sued the Gloucester County School Board in 2015, challenging a policy that bans transgender students from using school restrooms that correspond with their gender identity. Represented by the ACLU, Grimm alleged the rule violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Judge Doumar had initially thrown out the Title IX claim, despite the U.S. Education Departments interpretation of the law that Title IXs ban on sex discrimination also applied to transgender discrimination. Overturning Doumar on that point, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals found that the Education Department has the authority to establish that interpretation of Title IX. The school board plans to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to hear an appeal of that decision. In the meantime, the 4th Circuit had refused to keep the case on hold. And on Thursday, Doumar issued a preliminary injunction in Grimms favor, stating, This Court, pursuant to Title IX, hereby ORDERS that Gloucester County School Board permit the plaintiff, G.G., to use the boys restroom at Gloucester High School until further order of this Court. Joshua Block, a staff attorney for the ACLU who is representing Grimm, said of the injunction, The writing is on the wall how this case will ultimately end in Gavins favor. When everything is said and done, he added, we feel the confident he would have a victory, but this preliminary injunction makes sure that that victory translates into a real difference while he is still at school.: Asked by BuzzFeed News if the school board would try to appeal the order, Troy Andersen, the boards chair, said in an email Friday, The School Board understands the implications of the order and will continue to defend its reasonable and nondiscriminatory solution to this issue at the Supreme Court and trial court levels. Andersen declined to clarify whether that means the board would attempt to appeal the order. View this embed   Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

Mark Blinch / THE CANADIAN PRESS The 35th anniversary of the 1981 raids is a time when the Toronto police service expresses its regrets for those very actions, Chief Mark Saunders said during his annual Pride reception. It is also an occasion to acknowledge lessons learned about the risk of treating any part of Torontos many communities as not fully a part of society.

Gary Hershorn / THE CANADIAN PRESS The cops smashed doors as they went and men were marched out of the clubs and into the street. The patrons were charged with being found in a common bawdy house meaning a place where sex work or indecent acts are taking place. Many of the mens names were subsequently published, outing them to families and employers. More than 3,000 people marched in protest after the raids, getting into further scuffles with police. The raids and subsequent rallies have been compared to New Yorks Stonewall riots for the way they galvanized Torontos LGBT community.

aS"Protections for LGBT people could be unpicked, leading human rights lawyers told BuzzFeed News. View this image  Daniel Mihailescu / AFP / Getty Images LGBT people in Britain could see hard-won protections rolled back if the country votes to leave the European Union on Thursday, senior lawyers have warned. Across a range of areas, including employment, health, marriage, asylum, immigration, and the right to goods and services, a Brexit vote could have both immediate and longer-term consequences for LGBT citizens, according to a QC, a Home Office adviser, and an LGBT rights barrister who lectures in equality law. Once were out of the EU we lose the EU laws and regulations which underpin the Equality Act, Jonathan Cooper told BuzzFeed News. The act, which was introduced in 2010, guarantees equal treatment in employment as well as in private and public services. And once youve lost that underpinning, whos to stop the regulations being tinkered with? You could see challenges to the Equality Act happening and a situation where things are bleak because ultimately we get our equality through the EU and the single market.  Twitter Doughty Street Jonathan Cooper QC  Apart from civil partnerships and same-sex marriage, all other LGBT equality legislation that Britain enjoys arose from Europe, said Cooper, Britains leading expert on international LGBT human rights law. Decriminalisation, access to the armed forces, the equal age of consent, gross indecency [laws] all of those changes came about because of decisions of either the Strasbourg or Luxembourg courts, he said. LGBT people are always vulnerable to discrimination, he said, adding: I cant imagine why you would want to take away equality protections when thats all we have. He said employment protections in particular would falter in the wake of a Brexit vote. Youll get exemptions carved out, he said. Without the human rights framework, theyll say, Why cant you have an exemption for people [to discriminate] because of their faith? His fears were echoed by Sarah Bourke, a leading employment and LGBT equalities barrister, who lectures in gender equality at the Academy of European Law. If we are no longer in the EU there is nothing to stop protection for LGBT people in employment being taken away, she told BuzzFeed News. What it boils down to is political will. Bourke, who in 2012 successfully fought a landmark case against a Christian psychotherapist struck off for practising conversion therapy on gay clients, also fears religious rights infringing on LGBT rights in the event of a Leave vote. Twitter Sarah Bourke Sarah Bourke Organisations like the Christian Legal Centre have consistently been arguing for effectively the freedom to discriminate on the grounds of sexual orientation, she said. These groups are extremely well organised and good at lobbying. And there are elements in the Conservative party that are accommodating to a faith-based agenda. Both LGBT and heterosexual families could see certain legal protections eroded if Britain left the EU, said Bourke. There are workplace family rights such as parental leave, which is sexual-orientation neutral maternity rights such as maternity leave and the right to return to work. In the event of a Brexit vote and Leave campaigners within the Conservative party taking control, attacks on equal rights could be far-reaching, Cooper claimed, with even same-sex marriage at risk. By leaving the EU you lose the equality regulations you lose the EU charter, the [EU] Fundamental Rights Agency all these institutions that have been either the key instruments [to equality laws] or theyre a fundamental safeguard, he said. Whats to stop them [the Conservatives], without a prime minister like Cameron, repealing that legislation? Immigration, asylum, and refugee rights would be under threat too in the event of Brexit, said S Chelvan, a prominent LGBT asylum barrister and former Legal Aid Barrister of the Year. As recently as December 2014 the Court of Justice [of the EU] was instrumental in laying down guidance prohibiting the use of certain materials, including video and photographic material of same-sex activity being produced to support [asylum] claims here in the UK, he said. Its only because of the Court of Justice that clear guidance [exists] making sure that LGBTQI refugees are treated humanely. Exiting the EU could lead to the introduction of procedures that would be damaging and harmful to those seeking refugee status on the basis of gender or sexual identity. Twitter Twitter S Chelvan Any LGBT person who seeks to bring their partner to the UK from an EU country would face huge problems if Britain left the union, added Chelvan, who has won a string of groundbreaking LGBT asylum cases and advises the Home Office on LGBTI asylum claims. The Leave campaigners have made it clear they want to introduce a points-based [immigration] system, he said. And what we see with the minimum income threshold of 18,600 which has been introduced for non-EU migrants in relation to spouses is that its exceptionally difficult for the reunification of both same-sex and opposite-sex couples from non-EU countries. So with the introduction of that [for EU countries] were going to see insurmountable obstacles to maintaining your family life here in the UK. Cutting away rights for LGBT refugees could have a profound effect on Britains standing in the world as a beacon of gay rights, Chelvan added. Our international reputation is clearly going to be damaged, he said. And anyone who says the contrary isnt living in the real world. Jack Taylor / Getty Images However, other human rights lawyers who are not LGBT specialists, said they took a different view on the potential impact of a Brexit vote. Manjit Gill QC, head of international human rights at No5 Chambers, said he did not foresee any immediate or dramatic erosion of anti-LGBT discrimination measures, and regarded some of these suggestions as scaremongering, particularly on spousal rights. I very much doubt same-sex marriage would be at risk, he said. You never know what might happen in the future but in the short-term, judging by the public mood, I wouldnt have thought that is realistic. No5 Chambers Doughty Street Manjit Gill QC and Oliver Lewis (right) Gill remained concerned, however, about a wider issue: the lessening impact of international law on the UK beyond the EU. Where fundamental rights are concerned, EU law is embedded in, and to be seen as a part of, a greater fabric of international law. And therefore, a lot of other principles of international law have apositive impact on our domestic law, via EU law. So to Brexit would potentiallyput that sort of development in jeopardy. It would slow it down. He added: If you break away from international law principles there is the danger you start adopting narrow, parochial, municipal approaches to your law, which tend to stultify its growth. This, said Gill, would be seen over many decades. Oliver Lewis, a professor of law at the University of Leeds and human rights barrister at Doughty Street chambers, warned of a different international impact of Brexit - that it could set back LGBT rights in other EU nations. Britain is a really important actor in the EU and extremely influential because it has a strong history of protecting human rights, he said. LGBT groups in central and Eastern Europe really want Britain to remain in EU because of the soft influence that UK politicians and civil servants have in the policy table in the EU and in bilateral meetings people have in Brussels. He said some of the suggestions of imminent threats to LGBT rights in the UK were speculation as no one knows if, for example, the Employment Framework Directive 2000 would be repealed. But he agreed with the LGBT specialists that leaving the EU would bring widespread uncertainty. Every single EU law will have to be looked at in the next few years a huge piece of work, he said. My concern is that that in itself opens up the possibility for the new UK regulations and laws to undermine what already exists, or to come in at the lower level not to reach the EU minimum. And EU Law, he said, is a minimum not the ceiling but the floor.

aS"Across the country, LGBT communities are struggling with the aftermath and implications of the Orlando club shooting. In Jackson Heights, Queens, the queer Latino immigrant community is finding a way to organize. Last Tuesday, the day after a vigil at Stonewall Inn for the victims of the Pulse nightclub massacre drew a crowd of thousands, a much smaller group gathered in front of Club Evolution, a gay club in New Yorks Jackson Heights neighborhood that caters to the queer Latino community. Unlike most other events that had taken place in the city and throughout the country, this crowd was mostly Latino and Spanish-speaking. The popular transgender club performer Laura Martinez had organized the vigil, and she was holding court, resplendent in a snug rainbow-striped spandex bodysuit and a semi-sheer white fishtail skirt. People had traveled from all over the city and its suburbs to converge at the busy intersection of 77th Street and Roosevelt Avenue, leaving work early or taking the day off to be there. The mood was somber, looks of shock and resignation in equal measure on peoples faces, and no one was talking much. Several people cried soundlessly. Inside the club, as the lights on the ceiling flashed through all the colors of the rainbow and bachata blared from the speakers, Gabriel Gonzalez was sitting at the bar alone and nursing a beer. A bartender on one of the Circle Line boats that tour the Hudson River, hes lived in Jackson Heights for the past five years. The neighborhood is more than just where he lives its a place where, as a gay Latino man, he feels comfortable in a way that he doesnt in Manhattans white-dominated scene. Jackson Heights is, as the owner of Club Evolution Eddie Valentin put it, the gay Village for Latinos, where in a 10-block radius clustered around the Roosevelt Avenue subway station, youll find several gay bars decked in rainbow flags, and if you step inside, youre more likely to hear Spanish than English. Gonzales voice cracked as he remembered the moment he saw the photos of the victims and he realized they looked like him. Gonzales took off his glasses to wipe his eyes, apologizing for crying. Hes Puerto Rican, as were almost half of those who died. Were a Latino community, that was a Latino community that got affected, he said, though he added, Im not hearing much that it was a hate crime towards gay people, specifically, it was Latino people. If certain elected officials and media accounts have elided the fact that the majority of the victims and survivors were Latino and that many were immigrants and undocumented, the people gathered at the vigil were determined to highlight the names and faces of the victims and survivors. You start recognizing these faces as the faces you see in the bars here all the time, said Andrs Duque. Duque is a filmmaker and advocate who immigrated to the U.S. from Colombia in 1990. He remembered the first time he found a gay bar in Jackson Heights, hearing a Donna Summer song streaming out into the street and following it into a bar where he was just floored when he saw that it was full of gay Colombian men, dancing and kissing each other. I always remember that point when I walked into that door, a feeling of being home away from home, because there was this gay Colombian community, he said. That club, the Love Boat, no longer exists, but a handful of gay bars and clubs still dot the neighborhood Club Evolution; Bum-Bum Bar, known as a lesbian hangout; Friends Tavern, the oldest gay bar in the neighborhood, opened by Valentins partner in 1989; Hombres; True Colors; and a handful of others, all nestled on busy commercial streets and tucked in between Korean restaurants, South Asian threading salons, taco restaurants, panaderias, and Peruvian joints serving pollo a la brasa visual reminders of why many call Jackson Heights a miniature United Nations. According to census data, more than half of the neighborhood is Latino and almost a quarter of the residents are Asian. For queer Latino immigrants in particular, the club plays a critical role for many, it becomes home, the first place theyve found where they dont have to carve their identities into discrete pieces, the first place in the world where they feel a small measure of freedom to be their whole selves. Were a sanctuary for people who have no place to go, said Valentin, the longtime owner of Club Evolution. There are a lot of people who come from other countries, and they leave primarily because of the fact that theres so much prejudice and homophobia in their countries. When they get to the U.S., the first thing they do is look for a business thats gay, more likely a bar or a club, where they can make their first friends. View this image  The Latino LGBT community participated in a vigil for the victims of the Orlando Pulse shooting on June 12, 2016, in Jackson Heights, Queens, New York. Elias Williams for BuzzFeed News Jackson Heights was a gay neighborhood decades before it became a Latino one its proximity to La Guardia airport as well as its easy access to Times Square had long made it a bedroom community for many of the white gay New Yorkers who worked for the airlines and in Manhattans theater community. As white flight accelerated in the late 1960s in the wake of the passage of the Fair Housing Act and as more immigrants flocked to the neighborhood from countries throughout Latin America as well as Asia, slowly its gay bars changed hands to new, and mostly Latino, owners. Some still remember the days when 37th Road was called Vaseline Alley, a stretch of the neighborhood known as a place where gay men could go cruising late at night. While a few gay bars operated publicly, many more were clandestine operations where youd need a password or an invitation from someone in the neighborhood to slip through its doors. It was the 1990 murder of Julio Rivera, a bartender who was beaten to death in the neighborhood by three white men who were prowling the streets looking for a gay man to attack, that first catalyzed the LGBT community in Jackson Heights. Following his death, activists in the neighborhood held the first Queens Pride Parade and founded the boroughs first LGBT center, Queens Pride House. Council Member Danny Dromm, one of the citys first openly gay elected officials and a longtime resident of the neighborhood, was involved in the earlier organizing work and recalled how difficult it was to generate outrage about the murder of Rivera. He compared the response to Riveras murder to the outcry over the death of Matthew Shepard in 1998. I always look back on that and think, perhaps it was because Julio, even in the minds of white LGBT activists, was, you know, a Latino guy [who] lived in the outer boroughs, Dromm said. Oftentimes theyre overlooked, he said of the queer Latino community. In the minds of many people of color, the movement has been a white male Chelsea/Greenwich Village-led movement, a sentiment that is, he noted, rooted in reality. For Mauro Julca, Orlando was a wake-up call for the queer Latino community, which is, as he put it, a minority within a minority. Weve got to step up our game, he said, because the truth of the matter is, these things might happen. View this image  Elias Williams for BuzzFeed News Julca immigrated to New York City from Peru when he was 20 years old. His mother, whom he came out to when he was 16, knew many gay and transgender Peruvians from the hair salon where she worked, so she knew that the LGBT community faced high levels of violence. In Peru, he said, hate crimes are more like the norm. So they left, and came to New York. I thought Id be safer here in the U.S., he said. Yet Julca, a community advocate with a group called Latinos Diferentes de Nueva York, recognizes that violence is a reality that many queer Latinos in the United States face every day. Last year, a friend of his was attacked and robbed as he left a gay bar in Jackson Heights. He collapsed in the stairwell of his apartment building, Julca told me, and wasnt found until the next morning by his roommate. A New York Times analysis of FBI data recently found that of all groups in the U.S., LGBT people are the most likely targets of hate crimes, and the Anti-Violence Project, a group based in New York City that tracks and works with survivors of bias crimes, notes that within the LGBT community, transgender and gender-nonconforming people of color and undocumented immigrants are the most likely to experience physical violence. We know that LGBTQ folks are suffering tremendous amounts of violence, and this event just made it super visible to the world, said Natalia Aristizabal, a queer immigrant from Colombia who leads the LGBT organizing project at Make the Road New York. Aristizabal stressed that for LGBT Latinos who live at the intersections of gender identity and race and immigration status, the fear of violence is always present. She listed two recent incidents in New York City from the past two weeks alone, one involving a gay man whose attacker beat him while shouting anti-gay slurs; the other a Latina trans woman who was stabbed. For the past five years, Make the Road has organized a trans Latina march, and this year, it happened to be scheduled for the day after the shooting in Orlando. We had planned for Mondays march to be saying Stop the hate violence, Aristizabal said. We didnt even have to change the theme. View this image  Elias Williams for BuzzFeed News What will happen post-Orlando, in the coming weeks and months? Some of the contours of what is to come are already taking shape, with the dominant discussion centering on gun control. The Human Rights Campaign, the countrys largest LGBT advocacy group, has pivoted to the issue, making it one of its legislative priorities. And while it appeared for a brief moment that Congress, after a 15-hour filibuster led by Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, might vote to enact basic gun control provisions, those efforts failed on Monday night. Yet for many, its not enough if the debate around safety and violence focuses only on access to guns. Divisions along race (not to mention class and gender) have long existed in the LGBT community, and many are concerned that as in the past, LGBT Latinos, and especially trans and immigrant Latinos, will be left behind by the mainstream gay movement. Much like the recent Stonewall movie erased the actual leaders of the riot black and Latina trans women, butch lesbians, drag queens and whitewashed its history, will we forget that the victims and survivors of the Pulse shooting were Latino, were immigrants, were queer people of color? This is a question on the minds of many queer Latino advocates. The white gay community, theres a lot of services, advocacy, but I think theyre failing to look [at] minorities. Theres a lot of crimes, theres a lot of acts of hate that are still happening, Julca said. But sometimes, its sad to say that because youre not white, because you dont speak the language, it doesnt get addressed. Duque, who works at Queens Pride House, expressed a similar sentiment. Right now, everybodys hurt and everybodys looking for unity and being one. Im not a pessimist, but I think its [easier] said than done, he said. Looking at the broader universe of LGBT community in the United States, I think there are real divisions in terms of access to power, access to money, to funding. Hes referring to groups like the Human Rights Campaign. I dont know if theres a venue for an organization like HRC to do some of the groundwork in terms of the local Latino communities across the United States, Duque said. For club owners like Eddie Valentin, safety is foremost on their minds in the aftermath of Orlando. We have to bring more security. We have to do more pat-downs, including our good customers, which is something we were trying to avoid, said Valentin. While not everyone is pleased with the additional security, he believes its necessary, and hes also put in an order for handheld metal detectors. The owner of Hombres, another gay bar in the neighborhood, is planning to add another security guard and has already spoken to his staff about increased awareness of who is at the bar. Days prior, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio had announced that there would be increased police presence at the Manhattan pride parade, a move that has since been repeated by authorities from around the country, who are promising tighter security and more police officers on patrol at this months parades and celebrations. In New Orleans, that has already prompted one organization whose membership is primarily queer youths of color to pull out of the pride parade this past weekend. The group wrote on Facebook: [W]hat does it mean for the only LGBTQ youth organization made up of predominately youth of color with experiences of criminalization in New Orleans the very youth who were targets of police in New York and Los Angeles and all over the country in 1969 when the Stonewall riots against police were kicked off to feel unsafe at Pride 47 years later? facebook.com Does more policing keep the LGBT community safe? The mass shooting in Orlando has reignited this heated and long-standing debate, one that is often fractured along racial lines, reflecting the reality that it is queer and trans people of color who often are the targets of police violence. At last Mondays vigil at Stonewall Inn, NYPD Commissioner William Bratton was booed loudly as he spoke, people in the audience drowning him out with shouts of You kill people and chants of Say their names. One young man even screamed from atop a bus pole, Bill Bratton and his NYPD are gunning down gay, lesbian, and transgender black and brown youth. There isnt unanimity in Jackson Heights on this question. We need to have more police outside, said William Pena at last weeks vigil outside of Club Evolution. Another bar patron, Steven Urrea, believes that the NYPD has made progress in its treatment of LGBT New Yorkers. The police have been a great support in the community, and that has changed, Urrea said. Not everyone agrees. Hello, Stonewall, they came in and got us, right? It started with police brutality, said LaLa Zannell, a transgender black woman and community organizer with the Anti-Violence Project. Until police officers begin to treat queer people of color with respect, Zannell said, there will forever be a disconnect between the LGBT people of color community and the NYPD. Aristizabal of Make the Road New York sided with Zannell. Having a cop in front of a club? Thats never meant safety for us, she said. You dont understand how many police reports we get, and its like, Man dressed in a womans clothing gets stabbed. And were like, think about it. Thats not a man dressed in womens clothing, thats a trans woman who was on their way home or on their way to work and then this happened to them. But the tragedy in Orlando has galvanized the queer Latino community, and especially LGBT Latino immigrants, in a way that even the deadly beating of Julio Rivera in 1990, the murder of gay Colombian immigrant Edgar Garzon in 2001, and the killing of trans performer Lorena Escalera in 2012 did not. I see it happening on the streets. Four nights of marching, and tonight will be the fifth, Council Member Dromm said on the Thursday after the shooting. I have not seen that in the history of Jackson Heights. Equally as important, said Duque, is the way it has raised the visibility of LGBT Latinos within the broader Latino community. This is the way the Latino community starts to own the LGBT Latino community as their own, Duque said. It took this, he said, for people to realize that the Latino community is this beautiful, is this vibrant, is this amazing. View this image  Elias Williams for BuzzFeed News I went back to Club Evolution a few days after Tuesdays vigil and found a community that was still in mourning. A makeshift mural had sprung up on the wall of the bar, made up of pictures of the victims, their faces along with their names and ages taped together to form a public remembrance. Hung below the black-and-white portraits was a banner, covered with handwritten messages: We love you. I wish I was there to protect you. Love is love is love is love. Su muerte no sera en vano. Your death will not be in vain. If, in the wake of the shooting in Orlando, people were afraid to go to the clubs and bars that they loved, on that night they hadnt let their fear stop them. And in Jackson Heights, at least for a few scant hours, questions of safety, of what change will occur after the tragedy in Orlando, were pushed to the back of peoples minds. At Club Evolution, the TVs ringing the bar were all playing the USA vs. Ecuador Copa America soccer match, cheers erupting when either side scored a goal. Inside Friends Tavern just down the street, as bachata and Rihanna and merengue and Michael Jackson spilled from the speakers, everyone was doing the things that most people do on a night out taking selfies, smiles pasted to their faces; sitting alone at the bar, taking in the scene; shimmying as their favorite song started playing; scrolling through their Instagram feeds, their arms draped over one another a scene both beautiful and mundane and uncelebrated by most until tragedy struck, the quotidian now turned into acts that feel like defiance, everyone happy to be alive.

View this image  Stefan Postles / Getty Images Morrison was asked on ABC Radio Nationals Breakfast program about the ramifications of a marriage equality plebiscite on the LGBTI community - but instead he focused on the experience of people who oppose same-sex marriage. Frankly, people of very strong religious views have been subject to quite dreadful hate speech and bigotry as well, he said. It is not confined to one side of this debate. Morrison defended the policy of a popular vote on marriage, saying he had a bigger view of the Australian people than the Labor party, who oppose a plebiscite.

aS"Rep. Charlie Dent told BuzzFeed News that his bill would ban LGBT discrimination in certain settings, arguing that exceptions for people of faith would make the legislation attractive to fellow Republicans. View this image  AP / J. Scott Applewhite Republican Congressman Charlie Dent told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday that he plans to introduce a bill as soon as July to ban LGBT discrimination in certain settings with some exceptions for people of faith. The Pennsylvania representative predicted his legislation could win support in the Republican-controlled Congress unlike a bill from Democrats that has been stalled since last year in part because it would provide carve outs for people with religious objections to LGBT people. It will be easer to get bipartisan support for this legislation because it will be a Republican-sponsored bill. That will probably give Republicans more comfort, said Dent, who has taken pro-LGBT votes in the past. He added that the bills religious liberty protections should also give Republicans more comfort. Dent declined to speculate on how, exactly, his bill could balance religious freedoms and nondiscrimination protections. But he said the two interests are not irreconcilable. We are trying to work them out in legislation. Dent said he might be interested in providing carve outs for religious organizations that decline to make hiring decisions due to their faith, drawing a comparison to Catholic organizations that only hire Catholics. Id be hesitant to expand that to the private sector, he said. That is something we would have to work out. Last summer, Congressional Democrats introduced the Equality Act, a comprehensive LGBT nondiscrimination bill that lacked religious exemptions. That bill would add protections on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity to existing civil rights statutes, applying to a wide range of settings. However, the bill, which has only a handful of GOP cosponsors, has stalled without a committee hearing in the House or Senate. Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island and House sponsor of the Equality Act, said he would not support a bill that offers only partial equality. Well review the bill when its introduced, but Congressman Cicilline isnt going to support legislation that offers only partial equality, spokesperson Richard Luchette said. This debate is about securing full equality for millions of LGBT Americans, not about finding a half measure that Republicans can stomach. The scope of Dents measure is unresolved; it would apply in workplaces and housing, but its uncertain if it would also cover public accommodations such as in restaurants, theaters, and stores. The latter issue has become particularly contentious after North Carolina lawmakers passed a law to ban transgender people from using bathrooms that match their gender identity. Republican legislative leaders there had claimed protecting transgender people in public accommodations would lead to sex predators prowling public bathrooms a fear that appears to have no historic basis in fact. Im not saying public accommodation is on or off the table, just saying that its a little more challenging, he said. Its so politicized now. View this image  AP / J. Scott Applewhite But, he continued, My whole view is that you shouldnt be able to discriminate against someone in hiring one the basis of sexual orientation. The country is evolving, and many of my colleagues feel that the party needs to evolve on this along with the rest of the country. Unlike debates several years ago around a proposed Employment Nondiscrimination Act, a failed measure known as ENDA, Dent does not foresee controversy about including protections for transgender people in workplaces. Dent said he has discussed the bill with House GOP leadership within the past year, but he declined to characterize those conversations. He also said it would be too soon to suggest which House members could co-sponsor the bill. But as possible supporters, he cited dozens of Republicans who crossed the aisle in May to support an LGBT-friendly budget amendment. A source familiar with the bill said Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican from Florida who has taken pro-LGBT votes in the past, may also be key to the bill. Her office did not immediately return a BuzzFeed News request for comment. Dent said he wants to file his legislation sooner rather than later, adding, Id like to see something by July, but before the end of the year for sure. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Unless theyve had surgery, trans Canadians will be treated as their sex assigned at birth. View this image  Health Minister Jane Philpott donates blood at the Canadian Blood Services, in Ottawa, on Monday, Dec. 14, 2015. Justin Tang / THE CANADIAN PRESS Trans* donors who have not had gender-affirming genital surgery will be screened by their assigned birth sex, CBS said in a statement to BuzzFeed Canada. We recognize their assigned birth sex may be different than the gender with which they identify. Donors who have had genital surgery will be screened by their chosen sex, but they must wait one year after their operation before donating. CBS said trans* includes all transgender, non-binary and gender non-conforming identities. The new screening process will be in effect as of August 15. View this image  Chandan Khanna / AFP / Getty Images We felt that it would be better to have a standardized procedure and that way an individual trying to donate in Vancouver would be treated the same way as someone in Newfoundland or Ontario, Goldman told BuzzFeed Canada. It would be more respectful of donors because they would know what the policy was. Goldman says that because CBS deals with blood, our criteria tend to be pretty black and white. That means people are placed into broad categories instead of being individually assessed for risk. Where that leaves us with trans donors is theyre not an easy population for us to screen because theyre transitioning often, they dont fit nearly into a category, said Goldman. Intimate partners will factor heavily into this. A trans woman who has not had genital surgery and has a male partner would be treated like a cisgender man with a male partner, for example. The one year deferral period after having genital surgery is designed to match the one-year abstention period for gay and bisexual men. needed more space to write out my thoughts on Canada Blood Services saying only pre-op trans women are women In addition to the fact that not all trans people desire genital surgery, Banks said this way of thinking fuels anti-trans violence. The government is saying that straight men who sleep with women like [are] actually gay men or bi men, she wrote. This fuels transmisogny, it fuels trans panic, it fuels the reason men have been violent with me. Its especially problematic, she said, on the heels of Canadas decision to add gender identity and expression as protected classes under human rights legislation. And so Canada thinks making it a hate crime to attack trans women will solve problems but in the same breath tells men that sleeping with me is an act of homosexuality, she wrote. Previously, gay and bi men had to have abstained from sex with other men for five years before donating blood. That has now been reduced to one year. That change will also come into affect on August 15. Goldman said that while she empathizes with trans Canadians upset with the new policy, but she doesnt want trans people to be discouraged from donating if they fit the criteria. A lot of people are upset when theyre deferred and they want to donate. Our approach lumps people into categories, and in this particular situation for trans people, I can see that this is particularly complicated and difficult. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The lawmakers say blood donors should be denied based on personal risk factors for HIV, not their sexual orientation. View this image  Sen. Tammy Baldwin, center, accompanied by Sen. Chris Murphy, left, and Sen. Sherrod Brown, right, are among the senators sending a letter to the FDA on Monday. AP / Andrew Harnik Two-dozen U.S. senators on Monday will urge the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to scrap a policy that bans blood donations from many gay men, saying that the mass shooting at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando last week underscored how the policy discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation. The atrocities in Orlando are now understood to be the largest mass shooting in U.S. history, where 49 victims were killed and another 53 were wounded, most of them critically, said a copy of the letter, led by Senators Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, which was provided to BuzzFeed News. Yet, some of those most touched by this tragedy members of the LGBT community, who are especially eager to contribute to the response effort are finding themselves turned away, said the letter to the FDA commissioner, from 23 Democrats and one Republican. Current FDA guidance bans blood donations from men who have had sex with another man in the preceding 12 months a policy the Senators call a de facto lifetime ban for many healthy gay and bisexual men. They say the Orlando tragedy shines an ever sharper spotlight on the needs for a policy that rejects potential blood donors based on risky personal behaviors, which could increase risk of HIV, rather than rejecting people solely for their sexual orientation. As BuzzFeed News reported last week, more than 100 members of the U.S. House plan to send a similar letter to the FDA this week. The FDAs guidelines on blood donations were first approved in the 1980s during the AIDS outbreak. At the time, they banned men who had had sex with a man anytime since 1977, among other individuals with high risk factors including sex workers and intravenous drug users. The FDA relaxed that guidance in December as it applied to men who have sex with men, so it currently applies to those who have been sexually active within the previous 12 months. When it relaxed the guidance, an FDA official said the agency would revisit the policy as more data becomes available to consider risk-based assessments. In their letter Monday, the senators ask for an update on the current policys implementation and urge the agency to develop better blood donor deferral policies that are grounded in science, based on individual risk factors, dont unfairly single out one group of individuals, and allow all healthy Americans to donate. Based on advances in science and blood screening and safety technology, the letter adds, we expect that the new, one-year deferral policy is just the first step toward ending discrimination against [men who have sex with men] in our donor deferral policies. June 20, 2016 Robert M. Califf, MD Commissioner U.S. Food and Drug Administration 10903 New Hampshire Ave. Silver Spring, MD 20993-0002 Dear Commissioner Califf, We write to express our concerns with the Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) discriminatory blood donation policy for men who have sex with men (MSM), which has been highlighted by the tragic mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. As you know from previous correspondence, we are steadfastly committed to ending the FDAs discriminatory policy that prohibits many healthy MSM from donating blood and moving to policies that secure our nations blood supply in a scientifically sound manner based on individual risk. We appreciate your willingness to engage in discussions on the MSM deferral policy in the past. We also acknowledge the important step that FDA took last December to institute a new one-year deferral policy for MSM after the last sexual contact, replacing the long-standing lifetime deferral. While we support this step forward, a time-based deferral that is not based on individual risk remains discriminatory. The atrocities in Orlando are now understood to be the largest mass shooting in U.S. history, where 49 victims were killed and another 53 were wounded, most of them critically. During times of tragedy, the American people are quick to demonstrate their resiliency and mobilize in solidarity with victims and affected communities. We have witnessed that compassion as Floridians quickly lined up to donate blood for the wounded. Yet, some of those most touched by this tragedymembers of the LGBT community, who are especially eager to contribute to the response effortare finding themselves turned away. Due to the FDAs current MSM deferral policy, many healthy gay and bisexual men remain prohibited from donating needed blood. This tragedy shines an ever sharper spotlight on the need to move to a donor deferral policy based on individual risk factors. Based on advances in science and blood screening and safety technology, we expect that the new, one-year deferral policy is just the first step toward ending discrimination against MSM in our donor deferral policies. A one-year deferral continues to perpetuate inaccurate stereotypes about an entire group of individuals, and remains a de facto lifetime ban for many healthy gay and bisexual men. In light of these tragic events, and given that it has been nearly 6 months since you announced the new one-year deferral policy, we respectfully request an update on your implementation efforts, including FDAs engagement with local blood centers to ensure capacity building and operationalization, engagement with the LGBT community, and work to support future changes to the donor deferral policy. We urge you to move swiftly to not only implement the new policy, but also to develop better blood donor deferral policies that are grounded in science, based on individual risk factors, dont unfairly single out one group of individuals, and allow all healthy Americans to donate. Your attention to this important issue is deeply appreciated and we respectfully request a response by June 30, 2016. Sincerely, Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Mark Kirk (R-IL), Patty Murray (D-WA), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Robert P.

aS"Being abstinent for a year is a crazy thing to ask of people, said Jay Franzone. View this image  Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News The last time Jay Franzone had sex was in December. Hes cute, hes 21, and he could get laid anytime he even has a boyfriend. But the college senior is abstaining to make a point about the federal rules for donating blood. Under the Food and Drug Administrations latest guidance, issued in December, men are banned from giving blood or plasma until one year after the last time they had sex with another man. Being abstinent for a year is a crazy thing to ask of people, Franzone told BuzzFeed News. Realistically, gay men, just like straight folks, tend to have sex more than once every 12 months Franzone argued that the guidelines amount to a de facto ban for gay men. By jumping through the federal governments hoops a year without sex he hopes to demonstrate that the policy is not just unworkable but discriminatory. That frustration came into national focus this week, when a gunman killed 49 people and wounded 53 more at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando. Demand for blood skyrocketed, and nobody in Florida wanted to donate more than the LGBT community. But due to FDA regulations, gay men couldnt give blood even if they were HIV negative and didnt engage in risky behaviors. In response, more than 100 members of Congress will urge the FDA to change its policy in a letter next week, saying the agency should switch to a policy based on personal risk factors instead of sexual orientation. One representative filed legislation on Thursday to increase flexibility for blood donations during crises. When our community is attacked, we want to help, said Franzone. We want to be there. But we cant because were gay. Discrimination is still alive and well in outdated federal policies. Not having sex for a year is one way to get the FDAs attention, he continued. I dont want to say Im doing this for press, but I know this will get attention, and this policy needs to be looked at. Franzone, who is majoring in political communications at Lasell College, is also a spokesman for the National Gay Blood Drive a group that advocates for changing the blood donation policy but he spoke to BuzzFeed News in his personal capacity. He said that for him, this is a personal issue. There are plenty of my family members who have needed blood, he said. Friends have needed blood. They have invited me to donate with them, and I had to remind them that I cant. The FDA says the blood donation guidance helps prevent individuals at high risk for HIV from infecting the blood supply and that HIV is more prevalent among men who have sex with men. The agency points out the guidance is non-binding, but blood donation centers tend to follow it as policy, typically interpreting it conservatively. But Franzone, some HIV experts, several LGBT groups, and numerous Democratic lawmakers have hammered back that the rules lack scientific justification. In fact, they argue the blanket application of the rule can instead create backward results. For example, straight people who have frequent unprotected, anonymous sex can donate blood under the guidelines, but HIV negative men in monogamous relationships are unilaterally banned simply for being gay. In response to the shooting in Orlando, 109 members of Congress plan to send a letter next week urging the FDA to switch to a new deferral policy based on a donors risk factors not their sexual orientation. It is our view that this tragedy, more than any other, shines a light on the need for a permanent reversal of this policy, says the letter, so far co-signed by four Republicans and spearheaded by Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley. The 12-month celibacy requirement is unrealistic for most healthy gay and bisexual men to meet. Given the target, nature, and timing of this particular attack, the LGBT community is especially eager to contribute to the response effort, the lawmakers said in the letter. Meanwhile, Rep. Mike Honda introduced legislation Thursday stating the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall provide for increased flexibility in blood donor screening, while maintaining a safe blood donor pool, during times of national or local need. The Democrat from California added in a statement that the bill would help prevent tragic ironies, like the one in Orlando, that prohibited gay and bisexual men from donating blood. First approved during the AIDS outbreak, the FDAs guidelines banned men who had had sex with a man since 1977, among others with high risk factors including sex workers and intravenous drug users. The FDA relaxed the guidance last December as it applies to men who have sex with men, so it only applies to those who have been sexually active in the previous 12 months. Last July, when the FDA was contemplating the current rule, dozens of Congressional Democrats told the FDA in a letter that the one-year deferral policy would be discriminatory and not based on science, calling it unacceptable. Peter Marks, deputy director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the FDA, said on a conference call with reporters after the guidance was finalized the agency would revisit the policy as more data becomes available to consider risk-based assessments and a shorter deferral period. That risk-based assessment is exactly what Franzone, dozens of members of Congress, LGBT groups, and numerous HIV organizations are now pushing for. In letters over the past several years and months, they have argued that low-risk gay men deserve the same opportunity to donate blood as equally low-risk straight people. Franzone knows his role is limited. I dont think that me being abstinent for a year will result in FDA changing the policy, but I think this will increase the conversation. For now, Franzone has to contend with his boyfriend, Ben Sanders. When Franzone turned 21 in April, his boyfriend took him out for a wicked nice dinner on the 52nd story of the Prudential Center in Boston, he said. We got home, and, well, most people on their birthday are gonna have sex thats a pretty common thing in my age bracket. But sex didnt happen. That was really hard on my birthday, he said. The hardest part about being abstinent for a year is laying to next to my boyfriend and being like, Night, babe, and just going to sleep. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Nearly 40 years ago, nine men died when a fire broke out in a bathhouse in Manhattan. Whats changed, and what hasnt, in the interim. View this image  Fire at the Everard Baths, May 25, 1977. Bettmann / Bettmann Archive No one knows exactly how many men were inside the Everard Baths in the early morning hours of Wednesday, May 25, 1977. Maybe there were 80 to 100, as the building owner estimated later. Maybe there were more. Tuesday night was a big night at the baths, and many of the men would have rented one of the 135 tiny cubicles for $7 for 12 hours, or just a locker for $5. They would have been hanging out in the steam room or the sauna, grabbing something to eat from the snack shop in the lobby, swimming laps in the heavily chlorinated pool in the basement, getting a massage, smoking a joint, buying drugs from the attendant on the third floor, or having sex on a bed in one of the private cubicles or the big, communal L-shaped dormitory, also known as the orgy room. But by the time the fire engines came wailing down 28th Street around 7 a.m., nine men trapped inside a building with blocked-up windows and no fire escapes would not make it out alive. Eight years after Stonewall, the tragedy at the Everard Baths never investigated as anything but an accidental mattress fire marked the beginning of the end of a brief, exuberant heyday of New York City gay life that was able to thrive in part because of cheap real estate and a city government that was willing to look the other way when it came to, say, S&M clubs like the Mineshaft in the Meatpacking District (dress code included no cologne). But even as the 70s in New York were a relatively open, exciting time to be a gay man in New York pride parades, gay bars and clubs proliferating, a mainstream weekly gay newspaper, a gay rights protest at the 1976 Democratic National Convention in New York being openly gay, whether on the street or in the workplace, still came with dangers. The bathhouse had long been an anonymous space where gay men could be themselves without shame but the fire at the Everard reinforced the idea for many queer men that the few spaces they thought were truly their own werent always safe. Today, even as so much has changed for the better for the LGBT community marriage legal, queerness visible like never before the tragedy in Orlando reminds us that safe spaces for queer people, and particularly queer people of color, have never been safe, and have never been protected in the way that they should be. Everard Baths was not just any gay bathhouse; the writer Michael Rumaker, in his account of going to the baths (A Day and a Night at the Baths) for the first time in the winter of 1977, called Everard the most venerable, loathed, and affectionately esteemed baths in all of New York City. Everard (or Ever-hard, as it was nicknamed) had opened as a Turkish bath in 1888, but by the 1920s it had become a known, and culturally significant, gathering place for gay men. Author Gore Vidal met his longtime partner, Howard Austen, at Everard in 1950; over the years Everard was reportedly visited by the writer Truman Capote, theater director Alfred Lunt, the ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev, and gay rights activist and writer Larry Kramer. In his memoir City Boy: My Life in New York During the 1960s and 1970s, Edmund White remembers the Everard as filthy It didnt have the proper exits or fire extinguishers, just a deep, foul-smelling pool in the basement that looked infected. And Rumaker describes seeing a naked man who looked uncomfortable lying in his cubicle: In spite of his display of nudity and the knuckle-whitened hand clenched at his crotch, he appeared, from the tension in his face, in no way to be awaiting some delightful erotic occurrence. If anything, he looked afraid of getting beaten up, or murdered not uncommon fears in the backs of the minds of most gay males. But here that seemed, though not impossible, at least less likely to occur than elsewhere. Indeed, it was an important and, in decades when much of gay life was lived in secret, necessary space for gay men to associate with each other and, particularly for closeted men, a safe place to meet and have sex with other men. Bathhouses are private and exclusive; whereas anyone generally has access to other gay male spaces, like bars and clubs, bathhouses were, and continue to be, exclusively for gay men and thus play a unique and significant role in gay life. They generally existed on the fringes of lawfulness; the Everard, along with other gay bathhouses in New York City, were periodically raided by police, with a few people being carted off to jail for lewd behavior now and then, but generally left alone the ultimate in dont ask, dont tell. As long as the activity was kept out of view of the general public, whatever happened inside the baths was allowed to continue. But dont ask, dont tell also meant that the baths were treated with a kind of benign neglect despite a smaller fire four years earlier, owner Irving Fine had still not installed sprinklers. And thus the fire shone a not-totally-welcome light not just on New York gay life, but also on the citys negligence in making sure the building was up to code. As 26-year-old survivor Michael Rhone told the New York Times in the aftermath of the fire, Faggots are given a certain amount of liberty in New York City, and most of that is to hang out in sleazy sorts of low places that are substandard. At a straight health spa you wouldnt have rooms partitioned halfway up the walls so the fire could spread. New York City Mayor Abe Beames immediate reaction, at a news conference the day after the fire, was to announce that he had asked the district attorney to investigate why a bathhouse would have overnight guests thereby absolving the city of responsibility for the substandard conditions inside. Nonetheless, no such investigation by the district attorney seems to have ever been pursued. Nor was there any real investigation into the cause of the fire, which the fire department officially attributed to a mattress fire that bathhouse patrons had attempted to extinguish on their own before calling the NYFD. There was also no investigation into why most of the windows on the second and third floors of the building were sealed with paneling and insulation, and the only one that wasnt, in the bathroom, provided the means of escape for at least three men. And not only was there no investigation into why there were no sprinklers working in the building, but the city absolved itself of responsibility, claiming that an inspection the previous August had given the owner until the next July to install sprinklers. The owner himself, 62-year-old Irving Fine, who reportedly had a sketchy, possibly mob-connected past in the garment industry, was never held accountable for the buildings conditions, including the blocked windows. In fact, he rebuilt the spa and reopened it within the year. (It would stay open as a bathhouse until 1986, when Mayor Ed Koch ordered most of the citys bathhouses to close in the wake of AIDS.) View this image  The front page of the New York Times the day after the fire. nytimes.com The Everard Baths fire wasnt just any fire. The tragedy galvanized the gay community in New York in an unprecedented and public way, and it was considered a serious tragedy in a city mired in fiscal crisis. The Daily News put the fire on its front page with the blaring, all-caps headline 9 Die In West Side Bathhouse Fire; Fear More Bodies in Rubble; Sprinklers Set for Use on June 1. (A mischaracterization, it would turn out.) It occupied prime real estate on the New York Times front page as well, with a huge photo above the fold of the bathhouse with smoke billowing out of it, as well as a somber article beneath. And the gay community was quick to claim the tragedy: The pastor of the New York branch of the Metropolitan Community Church the gay church founded in Los Angeles in 1968 that had held services at the UpStairs Lounge just prior to the fire established a fund to help those injured in the fire, as well as pay for the burials of the men who were killed. The aftermath was also covered in the media. Homosexuals Mobilize to Aid Fire Victims was the headline in a New York Times article on May 26 that explained that gay men lined up to donate blood which today, post-AIDS, they are still banned from doing, meaning gay men couldnt donate to their friends and loved ones hospitalized after Orlando and helped identify bodies and promised to raise money on behalf of the injured, and that telephone appeals for help involved a network of 15 homosexual religious organizations as well as activist homosexual political groups. In this way, the Everard fire serves as a kind of pre-AIDS era timestamp: Gay men could still donate blood, because AIDS hadnt happened yet; gay political groups were actively advocating for gay rights in a way that was starting to be supported by the mainstream media. Just a few years later, the fight against AIDS would see the media and the city turn on them. (Nationwide, the story was a little more complicated: The tragedy also happened just after former singer and right-wing political activist Anita Bryants successful campaign to overturn an ordinance in Dade County, Florida, that prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.) The Times covered the tragedy with mix of respect quoting Pastor Lincoln saying that one man recognized the charred body of his lover only by a ring he had given him. They had been a couple for six years teachers in their mid-30s, just returned from jobs in the Middle East and prurience, writing in the same article that the Everard Baths were a kind of Marlboro Country among homosexuals gathering places said to have attracted a macho crowd of men who affected extremely short hair, tight jeans and leatherwear. Bruce Voeller, a co-executive director of the National Gay Task Force who would go on to be a leading AIDS researcher and activist (and die of AIDS in 1994), told the Times that you could often meet an off-duty cop or fireman at the Everard. Indeed, the baths patrons were not necessarily comfortable merging their public and private personas. Many men who signed the register at the Everard used fake names which briefly delayed identification of the dead. Like the general Everard clientele, they were a relatively diverse group: Among them were Adamo Alamo, age 17, who lived on West 108th Street in Manhattan; 27-year-old Patrick Knott, who lived on Bay Parkway in Brooklyn; and Hillman Wesley Adams, 40, who hailed from Scotch Plains, New Jersey. At least 10 more men were injured. There was no question, in 1977, that this was a gay tragedy. It was impossible to avert your eyes to the fact that this was a gay bathhouse, with gay men inside of it. Like the UpStairs Lounge fire of 1973, in which 30 gay men were killed in a suspected arson, there was no attempt or desire on the part of politicians or the media to claim it as anything but a gay tragedy. Today, in the rush to claim the Orlando tragedy as human, as opposed to a specific attack on queer Latinx people, the real danger that people of color and queer people still face in this country can get lost the first version of the Times story about the Orlando shooting didnt mention that Pulse was a gay club; the #AllLivesMatter movement elides the fact that violence by police against black people is an intractable problem. View this image  Goodreads.com  Three days after the fire, the Times published a photo of a crane working to demolish the building. Wreath on crane was left by someone who wanted it placed at the site, the caption reads, in part. Five months later, in October, another article was headlined Homosexuals in New York Find New Pride and opened with Yom Kippur services at a gay synagogue in the West Village. The citys homosexual population, which only a few years ago began to come out of the closet and into the street, has developed markedly in recent months into a cohesive, open and organized force. The point of the article seemed to be to reassure the Times readers that the gay population was not just interior decorators, Fire Island and bars with a leather motif although this world does indeed exist and flourishes in some neighborhoods. No, now the gay population of New York was now very much one of lawyers, physicians, teachers, politicians, clergymen, and other upper-class professional men and women. Aside from their sexual preference, many tend to live like their heterosexual counterparts. Of course, this description conveniently leaves out the thousands of gay men and women who were not upper-class and not white; race is not mentioned at all, just that there are serious divisions within the homosexual population in New York between old and young, moderates and radicals, the wealthy and the poor. The article also highlights the internal political conflict within the gay rights movement between militant groups and moderates: Militant groups like the Gay Activist Alliance continue to stage demonstrations more than a dozen in the last month which some moderates feel are counterproductive. The AIDS crisis, which would start hitting the citys gay community in 1981 and by 1983 become a full-fledged crisis, would put some of these politics on the back burner. The fight for rights and visibility became a fight for survival and for worthiness who got treated with concern and care, and who got treated with skepticism and discrimination. The fight for visibility took on a new urgency. The Times first story on the crisis, in July 1981, was famously headlined Rare Cancer Seen in Homosexuals and was buried on page A20. The Everard was rebuilt after the 1977 fire and was soon back in business. It wasnt until 1986, when Mayor Koch went on a campaign to close the citys remaining bathhouses in the face of the AIDS epidemic, that it finally closed its doors for good. Only a few bathhouses survived Mayor Kochs purge, including Manhattans East Side Club, opened in 1976 New Yorks Premier Social Relaxation Club for Gay and Bisexual Men, according to its website and its newer sibling, the West Side Club, which opened in 1995. In 1977, the fire at the Everard Baths was a reminder that there was no such thing as real safety which felt all too familiar last weekend. The world has changed a lot since 1977, but the need for truly safe spaces has not yet been eliminated. There is still, and will always be, a need for safe public spaces for queer people.

aS"The Human Rights Campaign said common-sense gun violence prevention measures are needed to better protect the LGBT community. View this image  Elaine Thompson / AP The Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the nations largest LGBT civil rights organization, on Thursday officially endorsed stricter gun control measures as a way to better protect the LGBT community in the wake of the Orlando attack in which 49 people were killed and 53 injured. The organization said easy access to deadly weapons had compounded the threat of bias-motivated violence against LGBT people, and called for restricting access to assault-style rifles, expanding background checks, and limiting the ability of suspected terrorists, and those with a history of domestic abuse, to acquire guns. It is the first time in the HRCs 36-year history that a special board session was called to adopt a broad policy decision. Forty-nine members of our community were murdered on Sunday morning because of a toxic combination of two things: a deranged, unstable individual who had been conditioned to hate LGBTQ people, and easy access to military-style guns, HRC President Chad Griffin said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. It is imperative that we address both issues in order to mitigate safety risk to our community. He called for lawmakers, religious leaders, and public officials to be held accountable for targeting the LGBT community through hateful rhetoric and legislation. The safety of the LGBTQ community depends on our ability to end both the hatred toward our community and the epidemic of gun violence that has spiraled out of control, Griffin said. facebook.com Fifty-three LGBT and gun violence-prevention advocates signed a petition Thursday, calling for more stringent checks to keep guns out of dangerous hands. With each new massacre, most recently the one in Orlando, we hope the number of homicides has pushed Americans over the threshold of tolerance for hatred fueled by people who seek to divide the country; for weak gun laws that arm those with hate in their hearts; and for the more than 90 victims of gun killings nationwide each day, affecting people of all backgrounds, sexual orientations, and gender identities, the petition states. The petition also urges Congress to enact laws to prevent suspected terrorists and those convicted of violent hate crimes from legally buying guns and to ensure that criminal background checks are required on all gun sales, both online and at gun shows. Any solutions to the problem of hate violence, including anti-LGBTQ violence, must address the alarmingly easy access that bigots have to such deadly weapons, the petition states.

aS"They were all members of the UNs LGBT Core Group, which discusses ways to ensure that gay rights are promoted as human rights. View this image  Hayes Brown / BuzzFeed News NEW YORK US Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power led a delegation of fellow diplomats to hold a meeting at the historic Stonewall Inn in New York on Thursday. The group comprised members of the LGBT Core Group at the UN a collection of 18 countries that work on LGBT issues at the global body. We couldnt think of a more symbolic place a few days after the monstrous attack in Orlando than this one, Power said. I think as we grieve with the families of those who were taken in such a horrifying way Saturday night, and as we stand in solidarity with the LGBTI community here in the United States, were also really motivated as a group because all around the world, on any given day, there are people who dont know that day will be their last. The attack on the Pulse nightclub in Orlando prompted the UN Security Council to condemn the killing of people for their sexual orientation for the first time. Tree Sequoia, a bartender at the Inn whos been a constant presence there for the last 46 years, gave the diplomats a quick overview of the history of the bar and the night of the famous riots that share the bars name. We were having the time of our life, he said with a smile, telling the attentive gathering of the stand-off between Sequoia and his friends and the police. View this image  Tree Sequoia speaking with Ambassador Power Hayes Brown / BuzzFeed News We lit every garbage can in the area near the building and threw them in the windows. That was when the riot police came because youre not allowed to burn down a bar with the police still in it, he said wryly, enjoying the laughs that came in response. Sequoia told the diplomats that he and his friends there that night didnt think much of the riot that resulted in the bar being closed down. The next year the first Gay Pride parade marched past the Stonewall Inn much to the surprise of Sequoia and Stonewall patrons. Power told Sequoia that the Core Group is trying together to show unity and to ensure there are far fewer no-go zones for LGBTI people around the world and far fewer that are punctured like the Pulse was. Outside the bar, where the ambassadors assembled to snap a picture before the meeting began upstairs, French ambassador Franois Delattre promised, My country was quite courageous in promoting gay marriage. Now we want as France, the country of human rights, to stand and the forefront of international efforts to fully recognize the rights of LGBTI persons. The Core Group is currently pushing at the UN Human Rights Council to establish a new role devoted to investigating human rights abuses against LGBT individuals around the world.

aS"As a gay Latino man I know there are few safe spaces for me, but Latin night always felt like a solace. View this image  Untitled from Colosseum Night Club series. Photograph by Leonardo Selvaggio I have to reach back two decades to remember my twenties, when I sought out the gay Latino clubs in L.A., San Francisco, Phoenix, Albuquerque, and New York. None of these cities were home. I was still wandering from one place to another, still reeling from the fact that my entire family had moved back to Mexico without me. I stayed behind because, as much as I loved my family and my homeland, I couldnt imagine at the time that they would accept the gay man in me. And yet, without them I felt incomplete. As much as I enjoyed the freedoms of youth, of being unanchored and flitting about like the mariposa that I was, kissing one flower after another, I yearned for the reminders of home. Immigrants are always looking, even in the next place of residence, for the echoes of what we abandoned or what abandoned us. I found solace in my friendships with other gay Latinos, men like me who loved their families but who were estranged from them, men who still craved the flavors and music of home a nostalgia for comforts that managed, if only for a few minutes, to assuage the pain of separation, of distance. But most importantly, perhaps our strongest bond to our homelands was our language. What a relief to communicate in Spanish, perhaps a chance encounter with the slang or lilt or speech of our towns. For many of us, our first tongue. For many of us, the words through which we first expressed love and fear and sadness and joy. And to have those words while inhabiting our queer bodies felt just right. The club. Let me be clear about something Ive learned as a gay Latino: No place is entirely safe, no building is a sanctuary. I have encountered violence and prejudice, or at the very least exclusion, in every social space. Like home, like school, the gay club was another complicated network of human interactions. It was not always pretty, it was far from perfect, but it felt necessary because my queerness was necessary, because my body hungered for attention, for the pleasures of movement on the dance floor where I was in close proximity to the other bodies I desired. Latino gay clubs or Latin nights at any other gay club appealed to my sexuality and to my ethnicity. On Friday evenings Id pull out the tightest black shirt in the closet. Soon afterward Id be sipping a Long Island iced tea at the bar, trying to feel confident and sexy as I waited for my friends to arrive. And then they walked in the door and someone let out a screech and someone else took a sip of my drink, and suddenly no one else mattered outside of our immediate circle. How did we manage to communicate in those noisy and sometimes smoky places? Through our bodies. This was as public as affection was going to get between men: a kiss on the cheek, a hand against the torso, and always an embrace. We hugged between dances and pressed our bodies together on the crowded floor, sweat clashing into sweat. This intimacy, where had we learned it? No, not at the clubs, but at home. For the gay Latino who grew up in a traditional household, the first parties were at home, in the living rooms and backyards of our relatives and neighbors. My first dance partners were my mother, my grandmother, and an assortment of aunts and cousins ta Norma, ta Luz, Marina, Vernica. The party was a birthday celebration, a reception, an anniversary, a holiday, or a visit from a distant relative or a family friend. Or maybe it was simply payday. But what remained the same was the music. For my Mexican family that meant cumbias and, for the more advanced crowd, salsas. No wallflowers allowed. That was not the Gonzlez way. No sabes bailar? Aprende! Here, let me show you, let me lead you, let me teach you to love what your body can do. The best part of the gay Latino club was that the DJ was one of us he knew how to tap into the memory banks of our childhoods by surprising us with a cumbia, a merengue, a bachata and our bodies sprang into action because not only was our muscle memory very familiar with the steps, it longed for them. We had learned to dance with women and here we were, dancing with men. Our lesbian friends dancing with other women. It felt just right. Our families taught us to move through the hard times and so, to cope with our loneliness, our homesickness, our everyday encounters with microaggression, sometimes in the exchanges with our very own allies, we danced. And we danced to cope with our breakups, our disappointing hookups, our unfaithful boyfriends, and our secret crushes. Exercise on the dance floor, lights dimmed, sound system cranked, was the best kind of emotional release. Oh, yes, how I cherish the time I have spent in clubs like Pulse in cities like Orlando, where gay Latinos the immigrants, the undocumented, and the first-generation Americans alike gravitate because we love men and we love our homelands, and thats one of the places our worlds converge. And we know, we have always known, that no place is safe we are queer people of color, no place is ever safe for us, not even the gay club but its one of the few spaces where, at least for the duration of a song, we can imagine a complete surrender to the music that transports us into the sheer enjoyment of a moment. We didnt give a damn. And we didnt have to explain a single thing.

aS"Nothing stops the police from arresting me [now] because Ive said I was a homosexual, said Eric Gitari of the National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission. View on Instagram People wait outside the Kwale courthouse, where two men were charged for alleged homosexuality in February 2015. Instagram: @nitwajina A Kenyan court ruled Thursday that law enforcement can force men accused of homosexuality to undergo anal exams, a precedent that a leading LGBT rights organization said could allow police to more aggressively pursue charges of homosexuality. Nothing stops the police from arresting me [now] because Ive said I was a homosexual, said Eric Gitari of the National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission, which brought the suit. The police can now use the simple allegation of homosexuality to compel an anal exam that could then be used to support the charge, Gitari said. This can happen to anyone. Anal exams are used in many countries that prosecute homosexuality, even though international medical experts say they are useless as evidence of sexual activity and human rights groups have denounced them as a form of torture. According to Gitari, Justice Matthew Emukule said in court that anal testing is a reasonable means of proving that someone had committed a crime, and added that the purpose of the rectum is to excrete solid waste if adults want to engage in sodomy they should know that its a crime. NGLHRCs legal team brought this suit on behalf of two men in their early 20s who were arrested in a 2015 uproar about an alleged gay porn ring outside the southern coastal city of Mombasa. The men face up to 26 years in prison for charges that include unnatural acts, indecent acts between adults, and trafficking in obscene materials. The judge ruled today on a challenge to the use of the anal exams as evidence, according to Gitari, and NGLHRC is seeking to stop the prosecution until this question is resolved. The use of these exams in this case is especially important because the prosecution is basing the unnatural acts charge on consensual intercourse between adults. Usually, that law has been used in cases of same-sex rape or where one person involved is a minor. In addition to the question about the exam being used to prosecute the unnatural acts charge, Gitari contends that the evidence does not support the pornography allegations, and the two arrested were not directly involved in the events that led to the outcry. Public furor broke out in early 2015 after a blogger published images from a cell phone stolen from a gay man that included some sexual images taken of friends along with non-sexual snapshots and pornography downloaded from the internet. Some of the images were republished by The Star, one of Kenyas biggest national newspapers, and the outcry put extra pressure on local officials to make arrests in the case. Gitari said the two arrested were targeted on the basis of rumor that they were gay, and only one of them was pictured on the stolen cell phone: a single non-sexual snapshot from the beach where he is shirtless. Lawyers for one of the men told BuzzFeed News in February 2015 that he was assaulted by a mob when the police picked him up. Gitari said the charges of intent to distribute obscene materials were based in part on the fact that DVDs found during their searches of their homes included the full set of Queer as Folk, which includes several incidents of kissing and sexual encounters between men. The men were taken for anal exams after they were arrested, and Gitari said the men unknowingly signed consent forms for a medical exam a form usually used before doctors examine sexual assault victims and the doctor wrote on their paperwork that the reason for conducting the exam was that they were suspected gays. Gitari said that NGLHRC immediate filed notice that it would appeal the ruling, and hes optimistic it will be overturned. Kenyas judiciary has recently issued a multiple rulings advancing LGBT rights in the country. We cant let this stand, Gitari said. I am very optimistic that the court of appeal will embarrass this judge and overturn this decision.    Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Oliver allowed TV cameras to capture the most breathtaking few seconds of their life. Dad Gary and his teenage child told BuzzFeed News how this decision set them free. buzzfeed-video1.s3.amazonaws.com / Via Channel 4 It was captured by a UK TV crew who were filming a documentary for Channel 4 about a childrens hospital and had been following the family for months. We see Oliver, who prefers the pronouns they/their/them to he or she, tell their family mum Jo, dad Gary, and brother Henry I am, like, 98.7% male. Wa-hey! There you go. Immediately, it cuts to Olivers mother telling the cameras that she almost knew it was coming, and Olivers father admits, I didnt have a clue. It then cuts back to the scene at the dinner table, where Jo asks, How did you work out that percentage? View this image  Channel 4 I dont know, says Oliver. I think 99% is a bit of a clich. As the family laugh for a moment, father Gary takes over. You just have to be who you are. And you know, Mum and I, thats all we desire for both of you just that you feel free to be who you are. But the journey to this point has been long and painful for the family and the year since it was filmed has seen more dramatic changes. When the cameras started following the Fitzsimmons family, it was the darkest period of their lives. Oliver, who has high-functioning autism, had recently come out of an eating disorders unit after nine months and after more than two years suffering from anorexia unable to eat, and starving themselves. They were also self-harming. Neither Oliver nor their parents had any idea what was the cause. Ive never really understood myself emotionally, Oliver told BuzzFeed News difficulty in interacting with others and using language in an abstract way can be a feature of people with high-functioning autism. I dont know how to verbalise emotions, which is again why my struggle with mental health occurred, because that [self-harming and an eating disorder] was the only way to show people how I felt. View this image  Henry, Gary, Oliver and Jo Fitzsimmons Adam Lawrence Earlier in the documentary, Inside Birmingham Childrens Hospital which in this episode focuses on the mental health of young patients we see Oliver turning up to the hospital in acute distress, confused, having suicidal thoughts, and asking for help. Within a few months, however, there is the scene at the dinner table, which was filmed last summer. The change in Oliver over a couple of months between the hospital and coming out at dinner is vast and swift. But how did that happen? It was really interesting, said Oliver. I filmed with a guy called Mark. Hes really cool, and one of the first things he asked me the first time he interviewed me with a camera was, Who are you? And he touched on gender and that made me think, Actually, yeah, who am I? What is my gender? Gender had never been something I thought about. I thought I was born a girl and that was it, and there were no options. That single question triggered a process of self-discovery, and within just a few weeks, Olivers mental health started improving as an explanation for their distress began to surface: They werent a girl. View this image  Channel 4 It really happened because of the show; I think it would have taken a lot longer if I hadnt been part of this, said Oliver. It made sense of the past seven years of my life. It all fell into place, which is really overwhelming. I can see now that my eating disorder was to prevent the growth of my female body, but at the time, I couldnt understand why I wasnt eating, why I self-harmed, and why I struggled with anorexia. In hindsight, the signs were there. At 13, Oliver had begun without understanding why asking to be called Alex (their name at birth was an unambiguously female, rather than unisex, name). But by 15, once the camera crew had started following them around and the self-revelations started surfacing, it wasnt long before Oliver was ready to come out to their parents. Was it not nerve-wracking or worrying, especially with a film crew there? Honestly, it wasnt something I thought about, Oliver told BuzzFeed News. I thought, Being open about it is going to help me. By the time I told them I was already doing very well and had gotten out of that dark place. So quite frankly I wasnt bothered if they didnt like it or not. Im sorry, but thats who I am. They may be my parents but gender and gender identity is not something that can be questioned by anyone else. View this image  Despite this, the reaction from Olivers parents, of acceptance, understanding, and unconditional love, proved transformative. From the age of 14 I wanted to run away to London and live in a shelter, said Oliver, because I didnt feel my parents understood me or who I was. But telling them and them being so supportive really showed me that that wasnt the case, and they do care about me and they understand me better than anyone else. Within weeks of coming out, Oliver went to Pride for the first time. I cried a lot and I met a lot of incredible people, they said. I was like, this is my community. Over the last year, since filming ended, Olivers life has blossomed. After three years away from school because of the treatment needed for their eating disorder, they are back at a new school, redoing years 10 and 11 in order to finish their GSCEs. Everyone at the school uses the name Oliver, and their head teacher is incredible. She wants to make sure Im as comfortable as I can be, said Oliver. Thats not all. Its been about a year since I last self-harmed, they said. I thought that was going to be a permanent part of my life, so its nice not to feel like I deserve to harm myself, and to actually realise there are better things out there that I can do when Im down than to mutilate myself. Oliver stopped for a moment, the tone in their voice changing as if now able to look back with some perspective the perspective of someone who is well. When I say it now it sounds sad. Learning to like a body that is covered in scars remains a challenge, however. View this image  Dad Gary and Oliver Channel 4 But something else has shifted. Ive gone from not eating to eating about 3,000 calories a day and I dont feel bad about it! said Oliver, excitedly. I love food now and its nice to be able to say that, because back then I planted an idea in my head that food is evil and it will destroy your life and no one will ever like you. Oliver said in a couple of months they will have access to an allotment and is planning to grow vegetables. They hope one day to be entirely self-sufficient. Being referred to a gender identity clinic has helped Oliver more generally, and theyve been attending appointments regularly for the last few months. This process has also helped Oliver re-examine their relationship to gender. For me, gender isnt separate boxes; its a spectrum, said Oliver. Right now Im not sure I want gender intervention, in terms of surgery or hormones. I dont want to rush into a decision when I still am not 100% sure who I am and where I fit with gender. When I came out in that clip they filmed and I said, Im 98.7% male even then when I came out as a trans man there was still a small percent of androgyny and Im exploring that a lot more. Gender, said Oliver, has been extremely restricting my whole life. View this image  Jo and Oliver at Pride Channel 4 A year on from the filming, Oliver has a new sense of self and identity. I would call myself agender, which is a lack of gender. Or just genderqueer. Olivers father, Gary, has also undergone a period of adjustment and understanding, he told BuzzFeed News. He uses the male pronouns talking about his child, perhaps a sign that the they pronouns are taking a while to get used to. But either way, Oliver said that although they prefer they pronouns, neither he nor she bothers them. For Gary, of paramount importance is that his child is now happy and healthy. When Oliver and it was immensely courageous on his part finally said about his gender identity struggle I was almost relieved because it helped fill in a whole load of blanks, said Gary. I thought, Right, this is beginning to make sense. When Oliver had been in the eating disorder unit it was like a bereavement not having him at home. Garys sentences started to fragment as he talked about that time: Very difficult. Extremely worrying. He added: There was clearly something really troubling Oliver, something quite profound, and I was totally clueless as to what it is. Now Oliver is a much happier person and as a family weve made a lot of progress. View this image  Channel 4 Understanding what underpinned Olivers illnesses helped Gary as a parent, too. My job as a dad is fairly simple: to provide and protect. Those were my two jobs and I felt like I was categorically failing in them both, he said. I didnt know what to do. So for Oliver to journey through that now to be a much happier person He broke off for a moment. All I want for my children is for them to be happy and safe. So if that means Oliver is a trans child and hes happy and safe then Im cool with that. What would he say to the parents of other trans, agender, or nonbinary children? I dont know what Id say, said Gary, stopping, before thinking again. Just love your children. Thats all. Inside Birmingham Childrens Hospital is on Channel 4 Thursday evening at 9pm.

aS"Responding to the Orlando shooting last weekend, three U.S. Senators will introduce an amendment on Thursday to bolster the Department of Justices Civil Rights Divisions investigation and prosecution of hate crimes, including hiring 100 more attorneys. View this image  Sen. Tammy Baldwin AP / Andy Manis Three Democratic Senators on Thursday will introduce legislation that would allocate $41 million to expand enforcement of federal hate crime laws and assist local officials with combatting bias crimes.The targeted attack of terror on the LGBT community in Orlando should be a cold reminder to us all that hate crimes are sadly and tragically too common in America, said a statement provided to BuzzFeed News by Wisconsin Senator Tammy Baldwin.Baldwin is backing the appropriations bill amendment along with Hawaiis Mazie Hirono and Marylands Barbara Mikulski, who is vice-chair of the Senate Committee on Appropriations.The amendment to the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Act which is currently on the Senate floor would provide an additional $30 million to the Department of Justices Civil Rights Division. That would bring the divisions total funding to $175 million. Among other things, the money would would allow the agency to hire 100 more attorneys to focus on enforcing federal civil rights and hate crime laws. The amendment would also allot $11 million to several DOJ Community Relations Service initiatives, which help state and local officials deal with bias issues. Communities need stronger support to take on discrimination and hate, and protect the freedoms that every American deserves, Baldwin said. The attack on an LGBT nightclub in Orlando on Sunday morning left 49 dead and 53 injured. Of hate crimes reported by federal law enforcement agencies in 2014, 18.7% of victims of single-bias crimes were targeted because of their sexual orientation, according to FBI data. In order for a hate crime to fall under federal jurisdiction, there must be some federal nexus such as interstate commerce. The shooter at a historic black church last June at Charleston, South Carolina, is currently facing hate crime charges, among others. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

Dar said it was like both worlds the LGBT community and Muslim community had clashed in a horrific way. Someone from the Muslim community my own community carried out [this] attack, Dar said. I knew then [that queer Muslims] would be caught in the crossfire of discourses set to come. Both sides view us as aberrations that should not really exist, but we have defied them throughout history. Dar even received stories from people who had lost friends because they no longer wanted to be associated with people who shared the same faith as the shooter. Dar also heard people cursing the mainstream media that they viewed as giving more time to a bunch of gays than those in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Queer Muslims, Dar added, often feel neglected, hardly acknowledged, and trapped as the middle person having to tip-toe around such multifaceted identities. Dar said they hope Muslim and LGBT communities will open up about these issues to help avoid further tragedies. View this image  Justin Tallis / AFP / Getty Images Zahra, not her real name as she wished to remain anonymous, said she felt depressed, anxious, and secretly wondered why Allah couldnt have just made me straight. She told BuzzFeed News of the tension that exists for queer Muslims: Islamophobia deems Muslims as too evil, old-fashioned, [and] backwards to accept homosexuality, and many in the British Muslim communities do view homosexuality as a sin. Overall, both communities essentially deny that queer Muslims exist, Zahra said. Being a queer Muslim is exhausting and since this tragedy it will be even more so. As well as not being openly queer, Zahra said that she is not visibly Muslim either, since she doesnt wear the hijab. She also worries that many Muslim communities will continue to pretend that [there] isnt a problem with homophobia and simply avoid the issue. Most Muslim scholars who apparently spoke out against the Orlando tragedy refused to mention the queerness of the victims, which in my opinion is also homophobic, she said. And, at the same time, we fear for our lives and wellbeing as Muslims. Zahra said that there arent enough safe spaces for queer Muslims in the UK, and the ones that are available are not well funded. LGBT Muslims need a platform where we can feel safe and not necessarily have to be out in the open about our identity if we dont feel safe enough [or] protected, she said. We need the tools to be able to be critical of the fiqh [religious theory] from traditional Islamic scholars We have been following the same fiqh for centuries.

Tauqir also said it was important to show solidarity, but to also remember the everyday and systemic victimisation of LGBT+ communities. To truly protect LGBT+ people you cant simply see us as victims of one major attack carried out by one person, she said. We are put through micro attacks all the time: poor healthcare systems that fail transgender people, poor financial systems that exclude LGBT+ family structures, erasure from sex education in schools which puts thousands of LGBT+ youth at risk every day. Showing solidarity at a time like this means opening your eyes to all these attacks on the existence of LGBT+ people. Because we find ourselves at the intersection of faith, gender, and sexuality, we face daily abuse from Islamophobes, homophobes, and transphobes alike, the statement said. Hatred and violence has no place in any of the communities we belong to and we reject and resist all forms of bigotry.

aS"I found a safe place. I found home. The G-A-Y Bar in London, the Stonewall Inn in New York, and the Kiki in Reykjavik, Iceland. tumblr.com Going to a gay bar at least once is a queer rite of passage. Returning again and again, though, isnt always in the cards. The club scene can be alienating for those who dont drink or otherwise arent the partying kind. You can find 10 bars for gay men within a three-block radius in practically every major American city, but lesbian bars are dying out across the country. And while drag queens have always been essential players in gay nightlife, trans and gender-nonconforming people arent always welcomed with similarly open arms. Many though not all queer bars are infamous for centering on and celebrating only certain kinds of LGBT people: namely, fit cis white guys. These spaces arent perfect. But for so many of us, theyre the best weve got: sanctuaries of queerness keeping the crushing waves of heteronormativity at bay; places to gender-bend without fear of rebuke, to kiss without objectification or shame. They are, for so many of us, a kind of home. Early Sunday morning, when a gunman stormed into the gay nightclub Pulse in Orlando, Florida, killing 49 people and injuring 53 others, the illusion of a queer sanctuary came into terrifyingly stark relief: Even our supposed safe spaces arent really safe. (But really, we all knew that already.) A Latin night headlined by trans women and drag queens of color ended in the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. A year after the Supreme Courts marriage decision, safety particularly for queer and trans people of color is still all too far from guaranteed. Gay bars arent enough. Not to assure the perfect union of every corner of our communities; not to keep us safe. But even after theyre brutally, horrifically invaded whether its Stonewall in 1969 or Pulse in 2016 they can be built back up. They can maybe even be home again. In honor of Pulse and its patrons, we asked LGBT people about what queer bars have meant to them. Heres what they had to say. I turned 21 three days before embarking on a four-month study-abroad trip to London. I had come out as bisexual a year before then, but had never been to a particularly queer space. I was pretty much the only out queer person in my friend group in the suburbs of New Jersey, and could only get to the queer community that I so desperately needed from the internet. I probably watched every single television show, film, and YouTube video that had a queer woman in it just to feel like myself. Fast-forward a few months, to when I was living in London. My friend, who happened to be gay, mentioned wanting to go to a gay club. I had only come out to a handful of people on the study-abroad trip as the story goes, you never just come out once. I was immediately filled with so much excitement and nervous energy. We made it to the Gaybourhood, adorned by rainbows and neon signs, and walked up to a bar called G-A-Y. That night was the first night of the rest of my life. I made out with two beautiful girls, I danced to Whitney Houston and Madonna, I hugged my friends. I was so fucking happy. I dont think anyone around me realized or understood the significance of that moment for me. I was myself, that was it. No shame, no discomfort, no wondering if anyone around me was queer, as I had done so many times in straight bars. It was the most beautiful, freeing night of my life. Nikki, 22, queer/bisexual The first gay bar I ever went to was the Dark Lady, in Providence, Rhode Island, when a straight female friend and I drove down from Boston to see a Leslie and the Lys show. The magic-marker Xs had barely dried on the backs of our hands before a drag queen breezed by and told me, in a tone as cheerful as if she were complimenting my haircut, Id eat your ass! I cant imagine a warmer welcome. I grew up in a small town outside a city too small to have much of a visible queer scene, and I was in the closet until after high school. The first gay friends I made were in college, and spending time with large groups of other gay people was still a novel experience. But as I looked around the Dark Lady that night, on some level I recognized even the strangers gay guy/straight girl duos like my friend and me, boys for whom high school was nothing but torture, girls who were never girly enough for other peoples hangups. I saw the untempered relief in their smiles, the ease in how they held themselves, their filial affection for the presiding drag queens. It was as though wed all crossed a finish line, entered a realm beyond the identity negotiation of the world outside. Inside, we were all just there.Ive been to dozens of other gay bars since the Dark Lady though none with a comparable Cher reference in its name and each of them, even the bad ones, has had the same fellow feeling at its heart. Wherever you come from, whatever youre wearing, however you identify yourself, and whomever youre with, you belong. John, 27, gay I moved from California to Arkansas for a few years. While I was there, I found this amazing community of drag queens, queer men, queer women, and queer allies who got together every Friday and Saturday in a small little bar to blow off the steam built up for days. To go into a place where it was OK to be. To exist. To be seen. To get into this bar, you had to drive to the edge of town and walk across a parking lot that had been the site of several bashings. Yet every week, without fail, we all walked across that parking lot and braved it all to have our safety inside. Now, I wonder about those I left behind when I came back to California. Will they still brave the parking lot? Did they do it last night in solidarity? If I had to guess, I would imagine the bar as more full than ever. It is a refuge. It is a place for the minority to be not ruled by the majority, but by the rules of love and light. But I also imagine last night was tense. More tense than other places I have lived and visited. I woke up today steeled by the fact that there was no news of violence at this tiny little bar in Arkansas. I was heartened, knowing those queer citizens probably rallied and vigiled and stood strong shoulder to shoulder. And I am strengthened by everyone who lives in a small town but isnt small themselves. Zee, 39, queer trans man I was 17 years old in 1979 when my gay boyfriend and I ventured to the Parliament House in Orlando, Florida. It was like walking into Wonderland an alternate Universe I never knew existed. For once, being a fat girl didnt make any difference. I was embraced and accepted for all that I was. I found myself in the midst of brilliant, eccentric, artistic and whirling-twirling misfits that pulled me into the middle of their all-male fold. Besides dancing to Donna Summer and drinking watered-down gin & tonics, the PH had a Show Bar where Drag Queens performed twice nightly. For some reason still unknown to me, the Drag Queens took me under their wing. I was not even in the bar legally, must have made a fool of myself with my ignorance of gay culture a hundred times, yet they sat me down in front of the make-up mirror and taught me how to paint my face. For years afterwards, I was asked if I was a Drag Queen (although the huge rhinestone brooches and bracelets, the feather boas and glitter in my pink hair might have had something to do with it, too). It took until I had kids that I learned to tone down my make-up enough that strangers didnt think I was about to lip-synch a song for them. Being in the bar allowed me to explore my then-fluid sexuality, no one telling me I was disgusting or sinful. I wandered in and out of the closet for another few years before identifying as lesbian after the kids were born. Those early days were a whirlwind of round-robin kissing, casual sex, and copious drugs, all while struggling to finish high school. A time when I was ignorant of the things that would kill us in the not-so-distant future. A time when we would never, ever have remotely thought someone would bring a machine gun into the bar and kill us by the dozens. 37 years ago, here in Orlando, that would have been me in that bar. Instead, it was the children of my peers. My heart sobs for the loss of innocence.  Barb, 55, femme dyke Im lucky enough to live in a country (Spain) where we dont need queer bars to feel safe, but for a (very) small-town boy like me, when I moved to the capital and started going to gay bars and clubs, it felt liberating: From a sexual and sentimental view, it eliminated the need to look for partners with the pseudo-anonymousness of the internet, or having to risk making contact with a heterosexual man. Just feeling that you could reach out to someone without any problem well, theres always the usual rejection, but that can happen to everybody, of course made the flirting, meeting new people, and making new friends easier and happier. Thats why things like the Orlando shooting or even Spains recent micro-epidemic of homophobic violence in Madrid feel so painful. Theyre attacking people in the sole place where they can feel really free. Marcos, 31, gay As someone who grew up in the South, in an evangelical Christian community, and as someone who didnt come out until later in life, Ive enjoyed very few truly safe spaces in my life. I came out mid-college to some people, but only close friends, and to this day most of my family doesnt even know my sexuality. Even now, Im afraid to use my name here on this post, because Im afraid that someone I know would see this and connect the dots. Were I to come out to the Southern church community I grew up with, Im sure I would instantly transform in their eyes from just being me, the girl theyve all grown up with for 18-plus years, to a bisexual, an Other, an enemy. And so Ive kept my mouth shut around my hometown and those I grew up with, even as I am out to new people who come into my life. To this day, even as I grow gradually more comfortable with my identity, I know that I am still not fully there. I still get nervous on dates with girls in public spaces, because Im in my own head constantly wondering what the people around me are thinking, or whether theyre staring, or whether theyve figured out its a date. My first time going to a gay club with some gay friends of mine, though, was entirely different. My gay friends joined me in scoping out cute girls, just as I scoped out cute guys with friends. Nobody there would even think twice about me dancing, holding hands with, or making out with a girl mostly because everyone there was already doing so. I felt free, I felt accepted, and I felt finally most like myself. And then the nights over. And I go home. And I dont post all the Snapchats, all the photos, all the funny quotes from the night out on Facebook like I normally would. And I go back to my carefully curated spheres. And I wake up, and I read about another club just like the one I visited, mere miles away, where that safety was violated. Where the reality of the rest of the world outside that safe space hit, and hit violently. And I begin to wonder how much longer I can possibly stay silent about my own identity. I wonder how much longer I can possibly stay in the shadows, trying to avoid being marked or known solely as a member of a community, without in some way being complicit in the hatred that goes unchecked towards that community. Towards my community. Anonymous, 23, bisexual I didnt see the inside of a gay bar until I went to university. I grew up in a town where it was just better and safer to stay in the closet. So I turned up to a small bar on the edge of my university town, on my own, fairly late in the evening. What I remember most is just standing, awkwardly, watching. Everything was so normal, yet so alien. Guys were flirting, with each other, as if that was a perfectly normal, perfectly OK thing to do. The people overenthusiastically necking in the corner were both guys, and no one was bothered. As if it was normal, as if it was OK, as if thats a thing anyone could do. A few guys wore eye makeup, a few held hands. No one looked worried, no one looked wrong. I didnt go home with anyone, I didnt speak to anyone, Im not even sure I made eye contact with anyone. I left after one drink. But the feeling that stayed with me was that I might actually be normal. I might actually be OK. And I knew Id be back. James, 30, gay BAR in New Haven, Connecticut, on Tuesday nights was the first place in my hometown where, as an out queer person, I felt safe, comfortable, and among my people. Sally, 37, queer My Sisters Room in Decatur, Georgia, was the first lesbian bar I ever went to, located across a set of train tracks along a residential street two blocks from my college. I dont think I even knew, before going there, that lesbian bars even existed in the South. By now, they largely dont. But in those first few months of me coming out and being far from home, MSR was a place where you could just exhale. You didnt have to worry about fending off unwanted advances from men, or posturing yourself as clearly interested in women, however that is even done in the semi-darkness of a bar. There wasnt the same kind of urgency that Id felt in other clubs of trying to Meet someone. There was a lot of dancing. And craft beer and cheap rum and flat Coke and a huge backyard with natural wood benches and songs from Justin Timberlakes only good album. The land where it once stood was sold for a condo redevelopment deal at the end of my freshman year, and the bars namesake moved to Atlanta, but they didnt even have time for demolition before an arsonist burned the building to the ground. Jessica, lesbian Gay bars felt like a safe space well before I came out before I felt like one of the people who really belonged there, they provided a space to socialize and dance that was free from the straight male harassment that was often customary in other bars. Since coming out Ive only been to one lesbian bar (there arent many left), and I spent most of the time there staring (probably too much) at everyone around me, amazed by how many people were there and how normal it felt. It was just like any other bar people who were too drunk, dancing, sloppy making out, yelling. Nobody seemed scared. Katie, 29, lesbian The first gay bar I ever went to was the Stonewall Inn. I was interning in the city and went on my first date with a guy ever there, completely oblivious to its significance. I saw my first drag show there that night too, before bouncing next door to Duplex, where we listened to showtunes and kissed. It was my first time kissing a guy in public. That night is always held dear in my heart, and Ive never felt safer. For the first time, I felt truly free. Matt, 24, queer Queer bars and clubs, to me, are like a whole other world where suddenly its OK to be gay. Its like being on another planet a less prejudiced one. Queer bars and clubs are like a blind spot in the camera through which society looks upon us and scrutinizes us for being who we are. Leigh, 19, transmasculine/lesbian My first time going to a lesbian bar (or a lesbian night at a bar, as was the case) was honestly transformative. As silly as it may sound, I looked around the room and thought, Wowall these people are like me in this one special way. On a practical level, it took out some of the guesswork as a young single lesbian new to New York I wasnt asking myself, Is there any chance they are interested in women? An ex of mine actually produced events and bar nights for queer women, and attending them made me feel like a true member of this queer/lesbian community, despite knowing practically no other lesbians upon moving here. Since then, lesbian bars have been some of the only places where I can dance wildly with my friends and not feel the discomfort of being ogled by the male gaze. They are the places in this huge city where I can meet strangers and find that we actually have many mutual friends in common despite having never met. They are the places where I am unafraid to be affectionate with my girlfriend because no one will look at us in disgust when we kiss, or view it as a stunt for their own entertainment. Cassidy, 24, lesbian Before college, I had no LGBTQ+ friends or role models. I felt alone and isolated as a newly out gay kid. When I was finally able to leave home, I found the gay club scene in Ybor City, Florida. Entering those clubs was like entering a whole new world. It felt like a bubble of safety for me and others who were able to express themselves and not have to apologize for it. I met so many others like me in those clubs, and I finally no longer felt alone. Rachel, 19, gay I grew up in a devout Catholic family, and gay clubs were the first places where I was able to express my sexuality openly. When I came out in college, I replaced my weekly church ritual with a weekly trip to my favorite club, so the two places are really connected in my mind. The shootings in Orlando fill me with a deep sense of violation, and sadness that I will never think of going to the club the same way again. Max, 40, queer I live in Manchester, so rather than just one queer bar, we have the Gay Village. My most prominent memory would actually have to be the first time I went through the Village. I was on my way home from college, 16 years old, and debating coming out to my family. I decided to get off the bus and walk it. Although I was only walking through the village for a few minutes, it felt like some sort of perfect moment in time. There was a sense of absolute relief from fear of taunts and abuse, a fear that I hadnt even realised was so constant until that moment. I also remember catching a glimpse of a barmaid through the window and becoming giddy in the knowledge that this beautiful woman was like me there really were hot gay women out there! Im not much into the clubbing scene, but for me, the option of a safe space, somewhere that I can be without being noticed, without feeling like I have to watch my back and be constantly wary of who is around me, is so important. Having somewhere where I feel accepted and normal has saved me so many times, and I dread to think what my life would have been without that. Hayley, 24, gay When my partner and I are at straight bars together, I always feel sexualized by straight men and women in the space. Ive been sexually assaulted on the dance floor while dancing with my partner at a straight club, which has never happened to me in queer clubs. Queer bars/clubs are the only public spaces I feel safe and free to be with my partner. Parinda, 25, queer/lesbian The best time I had at a gay bar was in Edinburgh near the theatre. It was my first time there, and my first time seeing the trans flag in real life and not online. It was also the first time I felt free to flirt with a girl, and the first time someone asked what pronouns I use. I spent ages with a gay guy talking about the city, and he hugged me right then, and told me I was his best friend. It was magical and perfect even if it was just for a night. Harley, 22, nonbinary and bisexual At every gay bar Ive ever been to, Ive always felt completely accepted and safe to be myself, be it holding hands with my girlfriend or just dancing like a complete idiot. It never mattered there. There was always so much love in the atmosphere. I have always been a self-conscious person, but anytime I went into one of my gay bars, it went away. Because I knew there I wasnt going to get judged for who I love or how I look. During college, when I finally came out of the closet to myself and those around me, I was introduced to the Quest Club in Birmingham, Alabama. It has always been held as a safe haven in my heart. Its where I learned to love myself for being gay, I learned my love of dance. Where I learned that Im not alone. Ashleigh, 25, lesbian Gay bars meant acceptance. Freedom. Love. A space in which I could be the truest form of me. In Baltimore, the main clubs I would go to would be Hippo and Grand Central/Sapphos. For quite a while, I went every weekend. I did not need to go with friends, because I could feel equally as safe walking to and from the club alone as with others. It was a place I could dance with anyone, male or female, and not feel like I had to worry about being taken advantage of. Some of the best times of my life were at the gay clubs. I miss them, but now I miss more the safety I used to find in them. Vicki, 34, lesbian I remember the first time I ever went to Cubbyhole in NYC I was so nervous! I thought, Am I gay enough? Will they know Ive never set foot in a queer bar before? The moment my friend and I walked in, we were greeted by Deb. WELCOME! WHAT CAN I GETCHA? I nervously ordered a beer, sat down, and chatted with my friend about what would happen next. You know what happened next? More people came in and there was more of Debs WELCOME, WHAT CAN I GETCHA? People got in line to play their fave jam on the jukebox and everyone sang along. We drank together, we laughed together, we told each other things I felt I could never say out loud before. I thought: These are my people. I found a safe place. I found home. Taylor, 26, queer It was a place where I could flirt with my date without everyone staring. It meant that I didnt have to be scared that we would be thrown out, threatened, or abused if we kissed or held hands. It meant that I felt safe. Cassie, 21, nonbinary and queer Before I came out to anybody, really, I went to my first gay club with a childhood friend. It was summer in a small town, not much to do, a drag show sounded fun. We walked in and sat down at a table, and before too long we were joined by a group of college girls. Somehow the conversation turned to where are you on a scale from 1 to gay? When it was our turn, both of us answered somewhere in the range of 6-7 (definitely not a straight answer). We sat and talked and flirted with the girls, all the time carefully not saying anything about our answers. Finally, we left and went back to the car. I remember us sitting there, neither of us looking at each other, not saying a word. Eventually, my friend said, Earlier, when they asked us if we were straight, and I said no, I wasnt lying. And I replied, Neither was I! We realized that wed both been going through the same journey all summer, both of us coming to terms with our identities and both a bit too scared to actually share it with the other. After a fair bit of tears and more than a few hugs, we drove off to the lesbian bar and spent the rest of the night dancing to Robyn songs. Years later, weve still kept the tradition of requesting Robyn at every queer bar we go to, and neither of us can listen to Call Your Girlfriend without thinking of that night. Jules, 26, bisexual Ten years ago, I met my now-wife at a lesbian bar. Laura, 34, lesbian The first gay bar I went to defied my expectations. It was merely a little watering hole in the buckle of the Bible Belt. It was ordinary and yet so different than any straight bar I had ever been to. Friends I had thought of as reserved and discreet, in terms of their sexuality, were opening up to me, and I was open as well. We could talk about things openly without coded speech or fear of being overheard. They played the music of queer artists and some classic gay icons as well. We could all go pee together in the unisex bathroom without missing one drunken joke. It was all like a bubble to disappear in. In there, they was no us or them. We were a we. Becca, 23, pansexual The safest I have ever felt dancing is in a gay bar. I can dance and flirt and drink without constant fear of being judged or beaten up for expressing interest in women. I can kiss a girl and know that both of us are into it and Im not kissing someone who is doing it to perform for some man. I can be as loudly and openly me as I want, without anyone telling me to tone it down or that Im too much. A gay club is the place that I first allowed myself to flirt with women. I was scared to admit that I wasnt straight (even coming from a very supportive and loving family) and needed a safe place to try on my new skin. It fit so much better than anything else I had ever worn, and I found it on a dance floor singing my heart out to 90s pop songs with a drag queen. Kat, 28, bisexual I started going to gay clubs as a freshman in college in Philadelphia. I went into my first club (amusingly called Icandy) with minimal expectations. There was this amazing queen named Isis who used to do shows on Friday nights, and she always included a game involving audience participation. It was wonderfully campy, and I knew her opening monologue by heart: Isis is my name, and fake pussy is my game! Suddenly, going every week and saying it along with her felt like reciting the Pledge of Allegiance in school. It was then that I knew what it meant to be proud. I had never been someone who considered his sexual orientation an important part of his overall identity, but interacting with the incredibly diverse array of people who frequent gay clubs and spaces, like Icandy, taught me how important it is to be proud proud, not just for yourself, but for all of those who came before you and made this possible as well as for all of those who still face terrible prejudice and violence. David, 23, bisexual The first time I went to a gay club, I felt comfortable for the first time. I felt I could dance and drink and be myself with a crowd of people that would have my back. I wasnt judged for being masculinely dressed, for once (as opposed to nights out at straight clubs). I felt if I hit on someone of the same gender I wouldnt be made fun of, or pitied, or worse, put in danger of my life ending. I could just be a drunk 20-year-old at a club having fun with friends. I felt normal. Nichole, 29, genderfluid, demisexual, panromantic, queer I vividly remember being in the middle of the dance floor at a gay club in Boston when I was 17. Six friends and I had managed to get in with fake IDs, most of which were questionable at best. I still remember the joy we all collectively felt, while dancing with each other, among our people. I had just come out to my mother, who was trying her best to understand, but having some difficulties, and my friends were all still closeted from their families. For us to be there, dancing, laughing, free of worries, and in a strange way, protectedsafe, was everything each of us wanted and something we all needed. We had made a conscious decision to be among our LGBT community, in an LGBT space, so that we could live authentically, and happily, as ourselves. I remember dancing, listening to Madonnas Get Together, and being truly happy in a way that I hadnt been up until that moment, as trite as that has the potential to sound. Looking back, I had always thought of queer spaces, like that gay bar, as places to openly embrace my identity, to create memories with those I loved, to share my stories and to hear theirs, and to be free there, in a way I couldnt be outside of those spaces. Upon reflection over these last few days, for me, and for my friends in that moment 10 years ago, in the midst of our young and burgeoning newfound freedom, that wouldnt have been possible without that bar, without that space, and without the sanctity that came with it. That feeling was important it was imperative. That feeling was temporarily taken from us, from our community, and as much as the bigotry, the violence, and the hate hurts, the breach in our safety, in the sanctity we built by and for ourselves, that pains as well. Moving forward, its only our strength, our love, and our resolve to each other through unity that can bring that feeling back. We will dance again, all of us. Kiefer, 27, gay When I came out, I didnt have any queer friends, or even any people I knew. I had recently moved to the South. My first time as a lesbian at an LGBT bar (I had accompanied friends as a straight friend) was a drag show. The MC called me out as fresh meat, but not in an offensive or unwelcome way. In fact, it had the opposite effect. People came to me and introduced themselves. Made me feel welcome. Within months I had a group of friends who understood me in a way other friends did not. Could not. I was welcomed with open arms. Where I lived, gay bars mean safety, community. Some of the bars are kept intentionally nondescript. No neon signs or pride flags. The owners understand that in the South, being gay is not always safe. Its not that we were hiding, its that we werent there for them we were there for us. To belong. To be loved. To love. Ashley, 32, lesbian There arent any queer bars/clubs where Im from in England; however, growing up, every time I went to London with my family I remember passing by a gay pub in Chinatown. There it stood proudly, with its rainbow flags displayed unapologetically. The image always stuck with me. And during those long conflicting years of being in the closet, it was always a quiet comfort to pass by it and know there was a community waiting for me.

aS"Days after the Orlando massacre, Attitude magazine is publishing a historic interview and photo shoot with the future king, who wanted to raise awareness of anti-LGBT bullying. Be proud of the person you are, William said. View this image  Leigh Keily for Attitude Prince William has been photographed for the cover of Britains bestselling gay magazine, Attitude, making him the first member of the royal family to pose for an LGBT title. It is due to be published on Thursday, just four days after the murder of 49 people in an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, Florida. The Duke of Cambridge, whose late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, was famously supportive of LGBT people and an early champion of people living with HIV/AIDS, has continued her legacy with both a cover shoot and an extensive feature in the July issue of the magazine. The article focuses on the devastating impact of homophobic, biphobic, and transphobic bullying and the consequent impact on the mental health of LGBT people. William, who is second in line to the throne, met with nine LGBTQ people who have all been the victims of abuse because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. They include Paris Lees, Britains most prominent transgender activist and journalist, who has been an outspoken campaigner around transphobic bullying and its link with the suicides of young trans people. View this image  Leigh Keily for Attitude Prince William told the magazine: No one should be bullied for their sexuality or any other reason and no one should have to put up with the kind of hate that these young people have endured in their lives. The young gay, lesbian and transgender individuals I met through Attitude are truly brave to speak out and to give hope to people who are going through terrible bullying right now. Their sense of strength and optimism should give us all encouragement to stand up to bullying wherever we see it. He added: What I would say to any young person reading this whos being bullied for their sexuality: Dont put up with it speak to a trusted adult, a friend, a teacher, Childline, Diana Award or some other service and get the help you need. You should be proud of the person you are and you have nothing to be ashamed of. The meeting with Prince William had a powerful effect on the LGBT people who took part. Paris Lees told BuzzFeed News: It was an honour to meet the Duke and I believe he was genuinely moved by our stories. When I first became an activist a few years back one of the biggest struggles was even getting people to admit transphobia was a thing. It is a thing. So is homophobia, and these prejudices are, as weve been tragically reminded just this week, killing people. View this image  Paris Lees Neil Dawson for Attitude Lees also said: Like many LGBT people I grew up in a society and household that made me feel ashamed to be me. Im proud we spoke to the future King and that he has spoken up for the community it sends a strong message around the world that everyone deserves to be treated with basic human dignity. When Prince William becomes King, he will also become head of the Commonwealth, in which the majority of countries criminalise homosexuality. His engagement with LGBT rights in such a visible fashion marks a dramatic step-change for the royal family, who avoid overtly political statements. Editor Matthew Todd told BuzzFeed News: Were delighted that Prince William agreed to appear on the cover because it sends such an important message not just here in the UK but around the world: homo-, bi- and transphobia is not acceptable. Todd added: My big hope is that this sends a message to straight people that they need to take over the lobbying of schools to protect all children. Its always seen as a gay issue but Ive met so many parents who have lost kids from suicide or overdoses as a result of homo- or transphobic bullying yet were stuck in this crazy situation where its not considered a mainstream issue. It is a mainstream issue and it has to be seen as one. Williams participation in the magazine article builds on work that he did last year for the Diana Award, a young persons organisation set up in his mothers name, for which he attended two events aimed at raising awareness of homophobic bullying. View this image  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at the American embassy in London. Afp / AFP / Getty Images Details of the exclusive had been kept a closely guarded secret by Attitude, the prince, and the royal household. However, on Tuesday, while William was visiting the American Embassy to sign a book of condolences for the 49 people murdered in Orlando, he let slip that he would be appearing in the magazine. The revelation triggered an immediate but muted confirmation from Attitude, whose managing director, Mike Buckley, said: We will have some exciting announcements to share soon. A Kensington Palace spokesperson echoed: We look forward to speaking about this soon. In its 22-year history, Attitude has featured a number of global figures on its cover who are heterosexual, including David Beckham (the first high-profile footballer to pose for a gay magazine), Tony Blair (the first prime minister to do so), Madonna, Heath Ledger, Daniel Radcliffe, and Kylie Minogue as well as a raft of LGBT celebrities, including Elton John, Lady Gaga, and George Michael. Attitude Attitude Attitude The Prince William issue marks the swan song for Todd, its award-winning editor, who is stepping down after eight years in charge and who this month releases a book, Straight Jacket: How to Be Gay and Happy, about LGBT mental health.

aS'A majority of the victims killed in the Orlando shooting were Latino, and nearly half were Puerto Rican. The reality is that now Im scared, but Im less scared of dying and more scared of living. View this image  Eduardo Gonzalez, Oscar Aracena, Jonathan Ruperto, Kimbu Garcia, and Simn Carrillo. Aracena and Carrillo were among the 49 people killed in a shooting at Pulse, a gay club in Orlando, Florida. Kimbu Garcia As the names of the victims in the Orlando, Florida, shooting started to trickle out initially, Kimbu Garcia quickly realized many of them were Latino. What he didnt know was that by the time all of the victims were identified he would realise he had lost three friends. Simon A. Carrillo, Oscar Aracena, and Jean C. Nieves were among the first friends Garcia made when he moved from Puerto Rico to Florida last year with $115 in his pocket. The 26-year-old left the island not only for better economic opportunities, but also because living more openly as a gay man was a priority. He found what he yearned for from three young men who gave him a place to stay, food, and, most important, a family. They were among the 49 victims Sunday, an attack that claimed the lives of many Latinos, 23 of them Puerto Ricans, the islands justice secretary said. As the media has descended on Orlando, trying to piece together horrific details of what led someone to brutally take so many lives, those who knew the victims and work with Hispanic groups in the city said news organizations have been erring in not paying enough attention to the fact that Latinos there were dealt a devastating blow. The shooting carried out by Omar Mateen wasnt just an attack on LGBT people, but also Latinos, Garcia said, whether intentional or not, at a place where many of them felt like they could truly express themselves. The truth is right now Latinos are facing more discrimination, not just in the U.S. but all over the world instead of moving forward as a society were going back, Garcia told BuzzFeed News. Its sad and alarming that this person chose to carry out this attack on Latino night, a night we look for to connect with people who look like us and listen to our music. Garcia said his is a community that is made up of three groups that the U.S. discourse is rancorous about: LGBT, Latino, and immigrant. View this image  Steven Fernandez / AP The attack took place on Latin night at Pulse, a gay club. Orlando is the 18th most-populous city for Latinos in the United States at over half a million, and about half of them are Puerto Rican. LGBT Latinos, especially immigrants, need these spaces because like everyone else they want to go out, dance, and celebrate but are criticized for being gay, bisexual, or transgender, Garcia said. The reality is that now Im scared, but Im less scared of dying and more scared of living, Garcia said. According to the most recent report by the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, people of color made up 80% of all LGBT and HIV-affected people killed in 2014. Claudia Maria Alonso worked with Jonathan Camuy on Telemundos show La Voz Kids, a kids version of The Voice made for Spanish-language audiences. Camuy, who was killed in the shooting, worked for the show as an assistant producer and Alonso worked in the wardrobe department. Why would someone want to specifically target such a specific group of people, Latino LGBT community? Alonso told BuzzFeed News. It angers you because you love this LGBT community. (On her Facebook page, Alonso shared a moment shell never forget, an early morning when Camuy came running to her yelling Claudia, we have a huge problem! His pants had ripped, revealing his pink underwear. Tears were coming down our faces from laughing, Alonso wrote. A complete laugh attack at 7 am.) On Monday, Zo Coln, director of Florida and Southeast operations for the Hispanic Federation, a national nonprofit that helps Latino institutions, said the media wasnt talking enough about how the shooting directly affected Orlandos Latino community. View this image  Victor Baez, left, cries with Iris Febo, as they mourn the loss of their friends Amanda Alvear and Mercedez Flores, who were killed in the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub. David Goldman / AP What happened yesterday was not just an attack on our LGBT community, but also our Hispanic community, Coln said. We know that 90% of the victims are Hispanic. However, the media has not done a great job covering that detail. Coln said its important for groups that work with Latinos to get together because Hispanic immigrant families of the victims and survivors will face specific challenges. Families outside of Florida like those in Puerto Rico or Mexico may have a hard time raising money to have a victims body buried at home. Getting information to undocumented survivors on services and benefits they quality for such as a U-Visa, a visa for victims of crime who assist authorities in an investigation, will also be crucial, Coln said. Its important to increase visibility to help people understand we have been impacted by this crisis as a community, Coln said. View this image  Bullit Marquez / AP Pedro Julio Serrano, who in 1998 became the first openly LGBT and HIV-positive person to run for the Puerto Rican House of Representatives, said he flew to Orlando from New York because he felt a direct tie to many of the victims. It couldve been me Ive been to that club, Im gay, and Im Puerto Rican, Serrano told BuzzFeed News. When I see a name I can relate to the name. I can relate to their faces because they look like me. Its because of the need to relate that spaces like Pulse with Latino-themed nights are so important to LGBT people, Serrano said, recalling his first time at a gay club. I remember I felt liberated, I could feel that I was truly myself for once and that I could dance with a man and no one could judge me, Serrano said. I was home. That might not seem like a big deal to some people, but places where people feel comfortable around others who look like them can be life-changing, Serrano said. Jorge Gutierrez, national coordinator for the Familia Trans Queer Liberation Movement, said people often depend on gay spaces like Pulse to help them survive and connect with other folks like them. Spaces for LGBT people of color are still limited and in many ways clubs become one of those spaces where people can be authentic, Gutierrez said. There arent enough of them and they are sacred this tragedy is reminding us of how we need to come together. Gutierrez said he was upset that media coverage has been focused on the LGBT community, with not enough focus on the gay Latino community. Its important to continue to center the story on the people most impacted, Puerto Rican and Mexicans, Gutierrez said. We are a fierce, resilient community and we will continue to organize and push back so we can protect our bodies and our lives.

While it can have a very positive effect and people are much more likely to accept someone they know and can relate to, it can be very dangerous.

aS"Something big is going to happen, a U.S. intelligence official told BuzzFeed News last week. But nobody can agree on exactly where the problem lies. View this image  FBI agents keep watch during the 2016 Gay Pride Parade in West Hollywood, California Mark Ralston / AFP / Getty Images WASHINGTON The U.S. intelligence official was troubled. Intelligence agencies around the world were struggling to get an adequate hold on the increasing number of decentralized lone wolf attacks, often done in the name of ISIS. The official didnt reference any specific warning, but something wasnt sitting right. It had been over two months since three ISIS-linked bombings had killed 32 people in Brussels and half a year since a coordinated attack in Paris killed 130. Something big is going to happen, the official told BuzzFeed News last week. It would only be a matter of time until another attack, though the official was skeptical it would happen on U.S. soil. In hindsight, it was an ominous conversation; just days later, gunman Omar Mateen, who pledged allegiance to ISIS in his final moments, would shoot his way through an Orlando gay club and kill 49 in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The officials foreshadowing underscores a deep-seated unease that has permeated the U.S. intelligence community in the wake of so-called lone-wolf attacks. The rise of this ISIS-inspired terror attacks that are committed by someone who pledges allegiance to the group and is inspired by online propaganda, but arent directed by the group itself has laid bare challenging pores in the domestic U.S. counterterror dragnet, which is often criticized for being too wide-reaching. Mateen, the 29-year-old Florida security guard who opened fire in Pulse nightclub early Sunday morning, had been on the FBIs radar before. Twice, he was investigated, once for claiming to have extremist ties, once for attending the same mosque as the first American suicide bomber in Syria. And twice, those cases were closed without federal findings. Mateens name was removed from all watchlists. The FBI was following protocol, and doing exactly what civil liberties advocates say it should: If evidence against someone doesnt amount to a chargeable crime, they shouldnt be watched by the government. How the FBI should have known about Mateen and if it should explore changing practice gets into very difficult constitutional territory. [Mateen] went off the watchlist. They automatically go on the watchlist when an investigation starts, and he went off. [After that] hes not deprived of any other right, Sen. Richard Burr, the chair of the Senate Intelligence panel, told a group of journalists this week. Hes an American citizen, and to apply it differentlyI think thats very dangerous. So it only took about 15 minutes for Mateen to be cleared to buy the assault rifle, originally reported as an AR-15 and later as a Sig Sauer MCX, that he would use to murder 49 people. The store clerk, under typical Florida practice, would have picked up the phone and called a hotline for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, and waited to hear either A for approved, CN for conditional, or N for non-approval. If Mateen had still been on an FBI watchlist, his attempt to purchase a high-powered assault weapon might have, if nothing else, paused there. The FBI would have at least been notified that a former suspect was trying to buy firearms. Instead, Omar Mateen walked out of a Florida gun shop, legally cleared to buy his high-powered assault rifle within minutes. The FBI was not notified, outside of the standard background check that wouldnt have tied him to any prior inquiry. Both investigations into his terror ties had been closed without federal findings, and his name had been long scrubbed off any watchlist. Until early Sunday morning, the feds had no idea that a twice-investigated terror suspect had picked up what would become a fatal arsenal. The gun shop, St. Lucie Shooting Center, followed protocol. Its owner, Ed Henson, a former NYPD police detective, told NBC the store did everything by the book. For our gun store, were all blown away at how he was allowed to purchase that gun when the FBI had interviewed him that many times, said David Shoopman, a National Rifle Association instructor at Boom Booms Guns and Ammo, a weapons store in central Florida, just inland from the St. Lucie Shooting Center. We have cops that come in that arent allowed to take their gun the same day because they got in trouble for something stupid as a kid. But then somebody that the FBI has actively investigated a couple times for terrorismthat shouldve been a red flag somewhere. But, it wasnt, and since Mateen was never charged with any crime, under current law, it shouldnt have been. Our extraordinary personnelhave prevented many attacks and saved many lives, President Barack Obama said in an address Tuesday afternoon. We work to succeed 100 percent of the time. An attackeronly has to succeed once. Somewhere, the system to catch potential attackers in the U.S. has a pinch point. Gun control advocates say its at the gun shop counter. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and some of his supporters say its at the borders, though Mateen, for one, was a native-born U.S. citizen. Some intelligence officials say its in the interrogation room, or at the FBIs counterterror division, or in a loosely-patrolled cyberspace. We dont have a list of suspicious people. We may not like what he says, we may not like how he acts, but if the investigation ends and there are no federal findingsat this point, there is no investigation, so there are no more barriers [on the federal side], one federal law enforcement official said, requesting anonymity as he wasnt authorized to discuss the matter publicly. That appears to be what happened here. The FBI declined to comment on the record about Mateens status on a watchlist, and deferred all questions related to Mateens status to its Terrorist Screening Center. The Terrorist Screening Center does not publicly confirm nor deny whether any individual may be included in the U.S. Governments Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) or a subset list, TSC spokesman Dave Joly said. Disclosure of an individuals inclusion or non-inclusion in the TSDB or on the No Fly List would significantly impair the governments ability to investigate and counteract terrorism, and protect transportation security. Wherever that gap is, Mateen isnt the first former-suspect-turned-attacker to slip through the FBIs fingers. The bureau was previously tipped off about Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev to whom Mateen reportedly claimed ties in his last moments and had investigated him for extremist connections nearly two years before Tsarnaev, joined by his brother Dzhokhar, brought a bloody carnage to the finish line of the Boston marathon. And Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik, who shot and killed 14 people in San Bernadino last December, were never on the bureaus radar until they opened fire, despite having exchanged private messages online about jihad and martyrdom before Malik emigrated to the US in 2014. Yeah, theres a gap here, said Sen. Ron Wyden, (D-Ore.), a member of the Senates Intelligence panel. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called Monday morning for an intelligence surge, and stressed the need for tech companies to help government officials disrupt terror plots. That battle, though, has been fought before in the wake the San Bernardino terror attack, both Clinton and Obama urged tech companies to be more cooperative in shutting down and flagging extremist activity online. The coming weeks will show just how hairy a potential solution to this gap could be. Congress has tried multiple times to legally force tech companies to not only shut down, but report terror activity on their platforms to government officials, a mandate that tech companies and civil liberties groups have fought in the past, saying it mutes internet freedom. And Democrats said Tuesday that they planned to revive a bill that would keep individuals on a government terror watchlist from legally purchasing firearms, a measure that has been blocked by the GOP and opposed by the National Rifle Association in the past despite more than 2,000 terror suspects legally purchasing firearms from 2004 to 2014. The FBI, meanwhile, has come under fierce criticism for its handling of domestic counterterror stings in the past, accused by civil liberties and human rights groups of inventing plots and entrapping otherwise benign, albeit hate-filled suspects in a tangled web of undercover FBI informants. What I want are policies that make us safer and protect our liberties, Wyden said. And too often, particularly when theres a knee jerk response after a tragedy, America gets policies that do less of both. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Elliot Morales was convicted of murder as a hate crime in March for murdering Mark Carson in New York Citys Greenwich Village in 2013 View this image  Richard Drew / AP  Elliot Morales, who was convicted of murder as a hate crime for gunning down a gay man in New York Citys Greenwich Village in 2013, was sentenced Tuesday to 40 years to life in prison. Mr. Morales, yours is a legacy of death and fear, nothing more, nothing less, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice A. Kirke Bartley said. I cant help but perceive or observe the parallel to the tragedy in Orlando, that parallel is revealed in hatred, self-loathing, fear and death. The charge carried a minimum sentence of 20 years to life. To family and friends of Mark Carson, it is important to hear from me personally. Im truly really, really, really sorry, Morales said at his sentencing hearing. He just had to say something and thats what he said. If he was sorry he would have never did it, Carons aunt Florine Bumpars said of Morales apology after the hearing, adding that he got what he deserved. In May 2013, Morales, 36, encountered Carson and another man walking down the street on a Saturday night and started taunting the two of them. He called them faggots and yelled other anti-gay slurs at the men before fatally shooting Carson point-blank in the head. Morales, who represented himself in court, denied that the attack was hate motivated, saying he was bisexual and had had relationships with transgender women. It is beyond my comprehension how someone like myself, who is bisexual, part of LGBT community can be convicted of a hate crime, Morales said. It took two days of deliberation in March for the jury to find Morales guilty of all charges against him. Any life lost to gun violence is a tragedy for our City, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said in a statement. But homophobic, hate-fueled incidents like this one are particularly unconscionable. As we mourn the lives lost in Orlando, we remain committed to doing everything we can to combat and prevent crimes against LGBT New Yorkers. 2.

After one warning from a traffic cop, one incident that resulted in four tickets, and one infuriating trip to the DPS (what they call the DMV in Texas) where I left empty-handed, my husband told me in no uncertain terms that he was sick of being my personal Uber and that I needed to get my shit together. So I went back, and after filling out the requisite paperwork and waiting the requisite hour, I was instructed by a DPS worker to just please step over there, maam, look into the machine, and read the letters. Ha! What a silly formality for someone like me, an avid reader with perfect vision! I thought. I knew I had 20/20 vision, ever since getting Lasik when I was 18. I had the receipts. I stepped up to the machine, peered inside, and said what I now realize is an absolutely ridiculous thing to say if youre taking a vision test: Wait, you want me to read all these letters? ButI cantsee them? Like, what kind of sham test was this? Why would you show me letters written in a font thats so small I cant read them? Just try, he said. Just try. As if I were a child convinced she didnt need to go potty. OK, fine, I thought. Ill TRY to read your stupid illegible letters. Ummm, OF?ummm.C?DA At that point, he cut me off and told me I could stop, as there was no point in continuing. And that is the very embarrassing way that I learned I need glasses. Again. When I was 4 years old, my mom noticed that I was squinting at the black and green computer screen as I played the 8-bit version of Reader Rabbit. She took me to the eye doctor, where I got my first pair of glasses. Given how bad my fathers eyesight was, this came as a surprise to no one. He was one of those people whose glasses were just a part of his face, his weak vision a part of his identity. No one has ever looked at me and said, You have your fathers eyes, but I learned pretty early on that I actually do. My glasses quickly became a part of my identity. I could never understand how other kids could lose or break their glasses. How could they be anywhere but your face? The only time they werent on mine was when I was sleeping and in that case, they were on my nightstand, within arms reach. I even wore them in the shower. When I was in second grade, I woke up in the middle of the night, feeling sick. I ran to the bathroom, paused halfway there when I realized I had forgotten my glasses, went back to grab them, and threw up in the hallway because I couldnt get to the toilet in time. Every year on school picture day, someone would ask me if I planned to take my glasses off for the photo, a question that always baffled me. Why would I want a photo of myself that didnt actually look like me? In the summers, I developed a pale raccoon mask underneath my glasses while the rest of my face got tan though few people saw it, because I so rarely took them off. My mom would sometimes snatch them off my face without warning. She could see all the smudges that I simply looked through, and it drove her crazy. Ugh, youre just like your father, with your dirty glasses, shed say. The same year that I got my glasses, my mom and I moved from Chicago, where I was born, to a small town in Michigan, to live with my grandma. Much of that time is blurry to me, but I remember learning at some point during those years, from the family therapist my mom took me to, that my mom had left my dad because he had been using drugs. Learning that didnt change the way I felt about my dad; I loved him, just like I loved my mom. Over the next few years, I wrote him letters, and sometimes he wrote back, or sent me a card out of the blue. In one of his letters, he apologized and wrote that mommy was angry with me for spending our money on stupid stuff. View this image  Taylor Miller / BuzzFeed My mom took me back to Chicago a couple times to see him, and he agreed to come to Michigan for my seventh birthday in August. This was a big deal, as hed never come to our house in Michigan before, and I was very excited. The day we were supposed to pick him up at the train station, I was wearing coral-colored shorts and a white sleeveless button-front shirt. My grandma French-braided my hair. Youve gotten so big since the last time you saw your dad! she said to me. Yeah, maybe he wont even RECOGNIZE me! I said. Oh, I think hell recognize you, she responded. She put a yellow bow at the end of my braid. When the train arrived, we waited for him to step off. We waited, and waited, and waited. Finally, my mom asked someone if she and my grandma could walk through the train to look for him. They did; he wasnt there. When we got home, I called the number I had for him at the time, but he didnt answer. In October, he finally called. He told me he had missed his train on my birthday and felt so bad that he couldnt bear to talk to me, which was why three months had gone by. I dont remember what I said to him. I probably said, Its OK. I remember my mom taking the cordless phone out on the back porch to talk to him, and I remember catching the phrase THREE MONTHS. I also know that she told me it wasnt OK, and that she was very angry. I remember being in my bed and her holding me in her arms as I sobbed about him. The same year I turned 7, I really, really wanted The Jolly Postman from my class book order, and after bugging my mom about it, she the woman who never received a dime of child support, who was, at this point, working minimum-wage jobs to support us, and who had every right to be angry about the fact that she couldnt buy me this book said, Why dont you ask your father for the money? For whatever reason, I still blindly trusted him, so I did: I called him and asked him to buy the book for me. The Jolly Postman is one of the items Ive always had in the mental log I keep of all the gifts hes ever given me. The same year, he went to Mardi Gras in New Orleans and sent me a big package of gifts including a tiny bottle of perfume, some unused soap from the hotel bathroom, Mardi Gras beads, and a pretty stuffed doll that I named Sweetie Pie and slept with every night. View this image  Taylor Miller / BuzzFeed My dad wasnt the parent that my mom and I wanted him to be, but I know he wasnt a terrible person. He was, in fact, an incredibly charming and handsome and smart and talented person. He went to college on a full theater scholarship. He was an Equity and SAG actor, was a member of the Childs Play touring company for several seasons, performed at Steppenwolf and the Goodman. He wrote scripts, composed music and lyrics, and sang. When we were all still living in Chicago, he bought me a little acting kit and would put funny makeup and silly wigs on me, and wed perform plays in our living room. He had the best laugh. I now get Facebook messages from his old friends who have been inspired to look me up in the decades since they last spoke to him; they always tell me how much he loved me, and how proud of me he was. youtube.com I was proud of him, too. I moved on from the birthday incident. I drew pictures of him and told my classmates that he lived in Chicago and that hed been in commercials. When people complimented my performances in school plays, I told them that my dad was an actor. In third grade, when I was in my ~Victorian phase~, I put a photo of him in a silver locket that I wore around my neck each day. I saw myself and my family situation as perfectly normal and didnt fully understand that the other kids at my Catholic school in Michigan might not. To their credit, those classmates were always very kind; they asked questions only out of curiosity, and no one ever made fun of me. The kids who were all white, except for me sometimes asked me if I was adopted, because they had only ever seen me with my white mother. They asked who the guy in my locket was, and asked if my parents were divorced. They asked if they could touch my hair. Wilkerson Family Collection Wilkerson Family Collection I was open and honest about so many things, but there were still a few things I kept to myself because I knew on some level that they were secrets. I didnt tell anyone about the drug use. And I didnt tell anyone that when I was around 3 or 4, Id overheard a conversation between my mom and dad where he said something to the effect of My parents could never deal with the fact that Im gay. (I am not the first child to learn this by accident.) I dont know how I even knew what gay meant, but I did and just as I somehow instinctively knew it wasnt bad, for whatever reason, I also knew that I shouldnt tell people that fact. I was 11 when my dad came out to me. And when he told me via phone, not long after that, that he was dying of AIDS. He didnt use that word, dying, but I knew what his diagnosis meant. I told no one about the conversation. In fact, the same night, I went to my sixth-grade dance as though nothing was wrong. But over the next 18 months, I started to realize something was wrong. I was older, I was beginning to truly understand the ways hed let me down over the years, and I was angry about it. I didnt know how to tell him that, exactly like 7-year-old me, 12-year-old me still said, Its fine but I started to pull away when hed call me. Yes, he was sick, but I was also sick of his shit. Envisioning a world without him wasnt that terrifying, because Id already lived most of my life without him. My dad died on my first day of eighth grade. I was sad, but hed been so absent in my life that I was also, to some degree, fine. I stopped thinking about him as much, stopped talking about him with pride like I had when I was younger. I didnt want to celebrate him, I didnt want to mourn him. I just didnt want to deal with him. I didnt want to be defined by tragedy, to be seen as an open wound instead of a person. I hated (and still hate) having to deal with the inevitable onslaught of questions that people always had when I told them anything about my dads life or his death. Having an absent parent or a dead parent is bad enough, but dealing with other peoples reactions to this information can be even more exhausting, particularly when you dont feel the way they expect you to feel about it. And I found that it wasnt that hard, as time passed, to essentially erase him from my story. Every year when I went in for my eye exam, my ophthalmologist would tell me that when I turned 18, I could get Lasik surgery. It would bring an end to all this to handing my glasses to my mom to secure when I went on roller coasters, to squinting during softball games because I couldnt wear sunglasses, to being completely reliant on those two lenses from the moment I woke up until the moment I went to bed. Six months after my 18th birthday, I had the surgery done. It was a little scary when someone is taking a laser to your eyes, its hard not to freak out but it was over quickly. After just five minutes in the chair, my vision was well on its way to being 20/20. The next day, at my follow-up exam, it was there. My glasses were obsolete. I loved the convenience of having perfect vision, but there were times when I felt a little naked without my glasses. I also felt like Id been kicked out of a club. When friends commiserated about their eyewear, I had to explain that I could understand where they were coming from, perhaps even more than they could. And when black, chunky glasses (exactly like the last pair Id owned before Lasik) came into style, I felt kind of cheated. I dealt with the downsides of needing glasses for 14 years, and now it was cool to have them? I was being left out of a trend that was basically my birthright? I eventually got a couple pairs of fake ones, but, afraid of being exposed as a hipster fraud, I never really wore them. When I had Lasik, I was told that Id probably just need reading glasses in my forties. And like many underpaid millennials, Id moved around a lot and gotten new and confusing health insurance each year, so I no longer had an eye doctor calling me to remind me to come in for a checkup. My attitude was, I got my yearly Pap smear; what more do you people want from me? It never crossed my mind that I might actually need glasses (again) until I found myself at the DPS, 11 years later, taking an eye test that was supposed to be a formality and failing miserably. As embarrassing as that moment was, it was nothing compared to how embarrassed I felt when I actually put on my new glasses after an emergency trip to LensCrafters the next day. Because when I put them on, I could see EVERYTHING. Which was really amazing, but also low-key horrifying. I was relieved that my expired license meant I didnt do much driving because holy shit, there was a good reason they wouldnt give me a new drivers license. Also, what the fuck else could I not actually see? After I got over my initial embarrassment, I welcomed my glasses back like an old friend. But my prescription is much lighter now, making me a slightly more casual glasses-wearer than I was before. I can, if necessary, run to the bathroom to throw up without them. And a whole new world of buying eyewear online is now available to me. A world that, frankly, I find overwhelming AF; I had to ask my friends who had been wearing glasses for, like, a mere five years how to buy mine online, which semi-enraged me. The eye doctors Ive visited in the two years since that failed vision test have reassured me that my Lasik was done perfectly. It wasnt the doctors fault; it was simply my DNA emerging to tell me that this modern newfangled surgery was cute and all, but it was time to stop playing and go be who I really am: my fathers daughter. In the same way that my natural hair the same texture as his grows back in eight weeks after I have it relaxed, my bad eyesight eventually came through. We can try to use modern technology to tell our bodies what to do, but sometimes our bodies dont give a fuck what we want. We can try to write our parents out of our narratives, but parts of them will always be in our blood. Taylor Miller / BuzzFeed Taylor Miller / BuzzFeed After he died, my dads glasses sat alongside his urn at his memorial service. He left very few possessions for me to inherit, but I did receive a briefcase that held both a musical adaptation of James Baldwins Giovannis Room that he wrote the magnum opus he was never able to get the rights to produce while he was alive and his last pair of glasses. I keep both in a locked box with the perfume, the soap, the locket, what remains of the Mardi Gras beads, and every card and letter he ever sent me. (Sadly, Sweetie Pie was destroyed when my grandmas basement flooded in 2007. But The Jolly Postman, which was on a bookshelf, survived.) The glasses and the script are tangible reminders of the intangible things Ive gotten from my father. I am a writer, I am incredibly nearsighted, I am his only child. I didnt always get a birthday card from him, but Ill probably get a new pair of glasses every year for the rest of my life. Some days, I wear my contacts. Most days, I wear my glasses. My guess is that before long, the friends who met me in my 20/20 twenties will come to see my glasses as part of my face, part of my identity, and that feels appropriate. Because I think if my dad had imagined when I was a little girl, or when he was dying what Id look like as an adult, he would have pictured me wearing glasses.

aS"A number of men have come forward to say they recognized Omar Mateen from previous nights at Pulse or from gay dating apps. View this image  Omar Mateen As photos of Orlando gunman Omar Mateen spread across the news Monday, at least five people with ties to the LGBT community said they recognized him either from previous nights at the Pulse nightclub or gay dating apps. Four people who regularly visited the gay nightclub told the Orlando Sentinel that they had seen Mateen there before. One person said he remembered Mateen at the club as long as three years ago. In the early hours of Sunday morning, the 29-year-old went on a shooting rampage in the club where about 300 people had gathered for the weekly Latin night. Forty-nine people were killed, and 53 others were injured. Sometimes he would go over in the corner and sit and drink by himself, and other times he would get so drunk he was loud and belligerent, Ty Smith told the Sentinel. Facebook: video.php The Associated Press on Tuesday reported that the FBI was investigating the reports. Jim Van Horn, 71, told the AP that Mateen was seen regularly at Pulse. He was trying to pick up people men, Van Horn said. Hes a homosexual and he was trying to pick up men. He would walk up to them and then he would maybe put his arm around them or something or maybe try to get them to dance or something and go over and buy a drink or something, Van Horn said. Thats what people do at gay bars. Thats what we do. I met him one time at the bar, he said. He was talking to me about his ex-wife. LGBT advocacy group GLAAD said Tuesday the massacre was an attack on the LGBT community and American values of equality and freedom. Whether the gunmans homophobia spurred from hatred of others or hatred of himself, this is homophobia all the same, the group said in a statement. And its sadly just the latest example of homophobia turning to horrific violence, just as it has for decades. View this image  David Goldman / AP Smith added that Mateen had talked about his father, wife, and child. Kevin West, another regular at the club, told the Los Angeles Times that he had exchanged messages on and off with Mateen for the last year on dating app Jackd. They never met in person, until West saw him outside the club about an hour before the shooting. He walked directly past me. I said, Hey, and he turned and said, Hey, and nodded his head, West told the Times. I could tell by the eyes. A former security guard at the club told ABC News that she was sure she had thrown Mateen out before. Another regular at the club told the Canadian Press that Mateen had once pulled out a knife after taking offense at a joke, possibly about religion. View this image  Pulse Orlando / Via Facebook: pulseorlando Mateen appeared to regularly interacted with men over gay dating apps, one man told MSNBC. Cord Cedeno said he recognized Mateens photo from Grindr. He was very creepy in his messages, Cedeno told MSNBC. I blocked him immediately. Cedeno added several of his friends had also seen Mateen on apps including Adam4Adam and Jackd. Two of them had been in touch with the FBI about their interactions. The owner of another gay club in Orlando told the New York Times that Mateen had tried to friend him on Facebook. Following the reports about Mateens presence on gay apps, CNN spoke with his ex-wife. Sitora Yusufiy had said in previous interviews that he was abusive during their short marriage and also made anti-gay comments. I dont know if he was gay, Yusufiy told CNNs Erin Burnett. He did feel very strongly about homosexuality. His father had also said that Mateen became angry a few months ago after seeing two men kissing. The statement prompted people to share photos of #TwoMenKissing across social media in protest. A former classmate told the Palm Beach Post that Mateen had asked him out on a date while they were in high school. The classmate, who did not provide his name, said he believed Mateen was gay. We went to a few gay bars with him, and I was not out at the time, so I declined his offer, the classmate told the Post. 4. LGBT People In Orlando Refuse To Go Back In The Closet buzzfeed.com 5.

aS"Anti-immigrant voices are seizing the moment, leaving LGBT advocates struggling to respond. View this image  Participants walk through the streets of Riga, Latvia, during the EuroPride 2015 parade. Ilmars Znotins / AFP / Getty Images A leading Dutch LGBT group asked the countrys anti-terrorism agency last month to investigate if LGBT venues could be targeted for attack. Nothing specific had triggered the request, but worries about threats added up in the months after terrorist attacks in Brussels and Paris. The group, COC-Netherlands, had become convinced that there is a realistic terrorist threat in many European countries at the moment, and we need to find out if this threat also against the LGBT community, Philip Tijsma, the groups public affairs manager, told BuzzFeed News. Brussels had already substantially altered its pride route that month to make it easier for security to monitor, and Amsterdam Pride in August could be the biggest of the dozens of pride festivals held in Europe this summer because its combined with the continent-wide EuroPride. The attack on a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, on Sunday has turned this hypothetical concern into a very real one, mixing real security concerns with the explosive politics of migration at the height of pride season. Initial evidence suggests shooter Omar Mateens only apparent connection to ISIS was a last-minute phone call to 911 professing his allegiance, and that he was born in the U.S. unconfirmed reports also emerged late Monday that he spent time in the gay clubs and on gay apps but anti-immigrant politicians in Europe seized on the attack to accuse liberals of politically correct blindness to security threats, while LGBT organizations are struggling to determine how worried they should be and how to take precautions without stoking anti-immigrant or anti-Muslim fervor. This time, as in Islamist territory, homosexuals were the target in #Orlando, tweeted Florian Philippot, a gay man who is a member of the European Parliament and one of the top officials of Frances anti-immigration National Front. This barbarism must be neutralized without any weakness. Geert Wilders, leader of the Netherlands far-right Party for Freedom, told BuzzFeed News that Orlando showed we should finally have a debate about Islam: What does it mean that weve imported so much Islam to the Western free countries. The freedom that gay people should have to kiss each other, to marry, to have children is exactly what Islam is fighting against, said Wilders, who is rare among anti-immigration politicians in Europe in also supporting gay rights. They know exactly what it means to have Islam imported to your society. Wilders, who said he would attend the Republican National Convention in the U.S. this summer, was encouraged that Donald Trump was making a similar pitch. View this image  Dutch lawmaker Geert Wilders Peter Dejong / AP Whether you like him or not, I believe the issue of Islam should be number one on the political agenda [and] hes the one person at least in America who is making this issue, Wilders said. This kind of reaction is exactly what immigrant advocates feared when news of the Orlando attacks broke, said Neil Grungras of ORAM, an organization that supports LGBT refugees, who spoke from Geneva, where hes attending a meeting of NGOs organized by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Its just leading to all these calls to stop Muslim immigration and to blame refugees, Grungras said. Grungras said he was worried that although many progressive LGBT organizations express strong support for immigrants, there has never been the same level of support among LGBT people, even concerning refugees who are fleeing persecution because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. The LGBT community has not really been forcefully behind [LGBT] migration, Grungras said, but then the LGBT community has not really felt directly threatened until now. This is the first frontal attack and it happens to be the worst [mass shooting] attack in U.S. history. My fear is that the solution is just keep immigrants away. Grungras added that the polarization over immigration and security had made it impossible to to address very real security issues that both LGBT people and supporters of immigrants need to pay more attention to. Grungras said he had found that many immigrants from Muslim countries were bringing strong anti-LGBT sentiment and equally strong attitudes towards gender norms and that he believed it was unrealistic to take someone from a culture where [homosexuality] is the most heinous they can conjure up, and expect them to change instantaneously. View this image  EuroPride 2013, held in Marseille, southern France. Claude Paris / AP The U.S. and European governments allocate almost no money to develop cultural sensitivity on LGBT issues with new immigrants, which makes immigrant communities potentially dangerous to LGBT refugees and to LGBT people who live in the countries where theyre resettling. Dramatic terrorist attacks are rare, but anecdotal reports indicate that street harassment is becoming increasingly common in Europeans most gay-friendly cities, he said, creating a dynamic that harms both LGBT and immigrant communities. In the gay capitals in Europe, there has been increased harassment of LGBT people in the gay neighborhoods, particularly where they mix with migrants, Grungras said. LGBT groups havent been wanting to talk about it because were very liberal, and our governments have made us understand that theyre not willing to launch education campaigns. The Orlando attack has caused duelling reactions among LGBT rights advocates, with sometimes conflicting impulses even within an individual leaders own thinking. They call for increased vigilance, but some also maintain that the rise of Islamist extremists doesnt necessarily pose any particular threat to LGBT people. Even an event of the size or visibility of the upcoming EuroPride isnt more of a target event than a football game or a shopping mall where females shop alone or transport where all kinds of [people travel]. I really dont think its an LGBT concern, said Kristine Garina, a Latvian LGBT activist who is president of the European Pride Organizers Association. Security officials reached by BuzzFeed News generally sent the message that theyve already been on high alert for a range of possible attacks and are not giving special scrutiny to LGBT events or venues, though an incident like [Orlando] is always a reason to keep a finger on the pulse of places additional threats may come from, said Edmond Messchaert, spokesman for the Netherlands Ministry of Security and Justice. But in Cologne, Germany where police were accused in January of ignoring widespread sexual assault allegations against men, most of whom were seeking refugee status the potential for violence targeting LGBT people did not appear to be on the police departments radar, even though the pride festival scheduled to begin this weekend has attracted upwards of 700,000 people in previous years. Police spokeswoman Natalie Stach for the region of North Rhine-Westphalia initially told BuzzFeed News she was unaware when the event was taking place and said the department doesnt evaluate security based on the nature of specific events, only on the basis of specific suspects. View this image  Ulrike Lunacek speaks during a gay pride parade in Lithuania in 2013. Augustas Didzgalvis / AP There is currently a high abstract threat situation in North Rhine-Westphalia, Stach stated in a follow-up email. Currently, there are no concrete signs of danger. Ulrike Lunacek, vice president of the European Parliament and co-chair of the parliaments LGBT rights group, said the Orlando attacks came as a special blow because she was participating in a Pride march in Warsaw, Poland, where 30,000 people gathered and had nothing thrown at us. Lunacek was assaulted during Vienna Pride in 2014 by a man throwing a foul-smelling acid. Though violence can happen, she said, it is critical LGBT people dont shrink from being visible. We have to recognize that of course LGBTI people can also be targeted, Lunacek said, but I hope also in Europe LGBTI people will not be afraid to go to the marches.

Under the law, homosexuality itself isnt criminalized but the promotion of non-traditional sexual relationships to minors is.

aS"The statement is the first time the Security Council has condemned violence on the basis of sexual orientation. View this image  Don Emmert / AFP / Getty Images The United Nations Security Council issued a statement on Monday condemning this weekends attack on a gay bar in Orlando, Florida in a statement that specifically denounced violence targeting people as a result of their sexual orientation for the first time. The statement was a landmark because the Security Council, the main body in the UN focused on peace and security, has never issued an official document of any kind referencing sexual orientation. Its a category that many countries have fought to keep out of UN documents, arguing that it is not recognized under international human rights agreements. Monday nights document was a press statement, not a formal resolution, but it still required unanimous agreement from the committee that includes LGBT-rights opponents like Russia and Egypt. The statement comes as the UN Human Rights Council opened a session in Geneva where a group of South American countries is expected to introduce a resolution to create the UNs first ever LGBT rights watchdog. Heres the full statement from the Security Council: The following Security Council statement was issued today by Council President Franois Delattre (France): The members of the Security Council condemned in the strongest terms the terrorist attack in Orlando, Florida, on 12 June 2016, targeting persons as a result of their sexual orientation, during which 49 people were killed and 53 injured. They expressed their deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims and to the Government of the United States. They wished a full recovery to those injured. The members of the Security Council reaffirmed that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security. The members of the Security Council reiterated that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed. They reaffirmed the need for all States to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and other obligations under international law, including international human rights law, international refugee law and international humanitarian law, threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts.

Fearing backlash and seeing it immediately online from all sides. A deep desire to hide again; I had cultivated so much safety and love within my communities and now it felt like this had been reversed. I had to work during the day and I had to take a breath to keep from crying as new information kept rolling in. I had to break my fast for this Ramadan today because of emotional strain. I am fortunate that my people, online and off, have understood and talked about the complexities of resisting Islamophobia as well as homophobia but I feel like Im walking on eggshells. I see what other folks have been experiencing and combating in their social media feeds and in the streets, and I want to be helpful but I have a fear that putting myself forward will make me more of a target of violence. We will not be erased in this tragedy. We will not be pitted against ourselves and others we are both and all things. Its not queers versus Muslims and it has not been historically. I am glad to see a lot of my comrades being brave and showing up in media, but I really deeply wish that it was under different circumstances.

He leads the Masjid Nural Isslaah, a progressive Muslim prayer center in Washington, D.C. One of the issues here is that a number of Muslims are not willing to look intensely, internally to see that certain ideas that they may carry [such as homophobia] have no place in the Western culture. And therefore, if this culture is not the culture for them, and they believe that certain types of things should not exist, then they should go to those theocracies where those laws can be abided by. And if they cannot do so, then theyre not living a true life as a Muslim, because theyre being silent about something that they hold deep animosity about. This is something that can cross a number of different barriers not just the LGBTQ thing, but racism, as well. A lot of it is based on cultural issues, not based on the faith itself. People need to step back and look at why they believe these things. I got a call from CAIR [the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a major Muslim advocacy group] this morning.

There is the moment of learning that dozens of people have been murdered, then learning they were murdered because they were gay, because they were trans, because they were queer. Just dealing with that heartbreak and fear and frustration. Then, to learn that the person that did the shooting is Muslim. Theres just theres just this sinking feeling. Because we know that whenever this happens, it almost immediately means retribution for the Muslim community. So theres this two-sided, abject fear. We cannot be safe as visibly Muslim persons, and we cannot be safe as queer people. There are people that find strength in Islam, and to see it portrayed as something thats vile its just horrifying [] but at the same time were all coming from experiences of spiritual violence, of deeply rooted homophobia. And homophobia isnt even the right word its hatred. Its violence. And if its prevalent in Islam its because its prevalent in the world. So were torn between needing to defend the faith that gives us strength, and needing to resist the homophobia and the transphobia and the spiritual violence that are very real parts of our everyday experience as Muslims.  Im seeing statements from imams and from Muslim organizations, over and over again, decrying the violence, praying for the victims, but never once addressing that these are gay people being murdered, trans people, queer people being murdered. Theres a disconnect between the reality and whats being spoken, because theres a reluctance to admit that Islam has a very serious issue with homophobia.

I was brushing my teeth when I found out about Orlando I brushed so hard my gums started bleeding. I felt broken. How else am I supposed to feel when our people (queers) are attacked and killed by my people (Muslim)? I love being a queer Muslim. As a queer Muslim, I occupy a position on the margins of both the queer and Muslim communities. While its imperative to address the material struggles and disparities of marginalization, being on the outside is also a blessing. Its only from the margins that I get to develop a critical perspective that, with other queer Muslims, is cultivated and transformed into a creative energy which weve used to generate a truly beautiful community of our own. Islam, to me, means social justice. I learned about grassroots activism and standing up for my beliefs at my hometown masjid, the Kalamazoo Islamic Center. Led mostly by women elders like Gulnar Husain and Shadia Kanaan, we organized and marched in opposition to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and against the U.S.-funded Israeli apartheid in Palestine. Islam also means community. Although my relationship with Allah is mine and mine alone, my spiritual practice of Islam happens only in community with my Muslim family, my ummah: we pray together, we fast together, we make pilgrimage together, we celebrate together, and we mourn together. Last, and perhaps most importantly, Islam means diversity. We are not just Arab. We are from Nigeria and Indonesia and China and India. Islam is shaped by the richness of the many cultures and traditions we represent.

While I was born to Muslim parents, my personal acceptance of Islam as my faith didnt happen until I was in my late teens, after I had finished reading the Quran for myself. To me, Islam is a source of peace, comfort and joy in my life. The doctrine of surrender to Allah helps me to put my life and any problems I face in perspective, while giving me the strength to face challenges head-on. My faith is a very personal thing to me a private connection between myself and my God, and through that God, the rest of the universe/creation. Islam and queerness are just two aspects of my identity. On an internal level, I dont feel as though theres much of a conflict. On a community level, queerness has actually helped reconnect with and reaffirm my faith, as Ive found communities of queer and trans Muslims online whove become like kin to me. I think I would be less devout if not for queer and trans Muslims helping me to remember the best of our faith, and how it can empower and inspire us daily. When I heard about Orlando I felt sadness, then fear both as a queer person and a Muslim. I thought immediately about how often I and many of my loved ones both Muslim and otherwise frequent gay bars and other supposedly safe spaces, and I felt scared for all of us. But at the back of my mind even then was that sense of dread I feel whenever Islam is in the news: Oh boy, here we go again. The Islamophobic messages started soon after that, and they havent stopped yet. View this image  Meena Majid co-founded Noor, a safe, confidential gathering space for queer Muslims in Seattle.

But there are going to be many, many Muslims who are given a further sermon on this it happened during Ramadan, maybe this is a sign, or whatever bullshit they want to talk about. And theres going to be a lot of gay people during Pride who are going to be holding up signs for Orlando and spitting on all the queer Muslims that walk by. I actually teach a workshop called Islamohomophobia. People come to it thinking theyre going to learn about homophobia in Islam, but its actually about Islamophobia in the queer community. I dont think theres much room for people of faith in the queer community, which claims to be so inclusive. In order to help queer Muslims grieve in this situation, I think we should allow them the space to grieve [] I suggest people step back and listen. Show up at vigils, show at protests, and use your power in those ways to have other peoples voices heard and not your own. And give them their space. Space is what we need, because were tired of not being seen.

So, then the question becomes how does that work continue, how does it take shape as this cultural moment were in unfolds, what can we do to support our members but also the community at large. Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti says in his last sermon love all and hate none is but never refuse to bless and help the needy and the poor, the widow and the orphan, if they come to your door. This is your Mission of Peace, to serve the people. [] I take this very seriously as a Sufi Muslim. If I can live a life of service to ending oppression, if I can live a life dedicated to writing and embodying activist theologies, making space for queer Muslims and queer people of faith at large to connect with the divine and each other, then I will have lived a good life. I want people to know that our community, like any other, is a symphony of stories, whose complexity and diversity are like the notes on a page. No one note is more important than the other, they are all essential. But it only begins to unfold if you take the time to truly listen. View this image  View this image  Izzaddine Mustafa, 24, is a trans man currently living in Brooklyn, New York. He works as a social media director for a local nonprofit. When I first came out, I was afraid of how my Muslim community would react. I was afraid that you cannot be Muslim if you are queer, and you could not be queer if you were Muslim. I then came to realize that to be Muslim and queer goes hand in hand with the idea that you must love your full authentic self in order to fully love and embrace others. When I heard about what happened in Orlando, I felt numb. After a week of Ramadan celebrations and celebrating pride in Brooklyn the same night as the shooting, I was in disbelief. I read the name of the shooter, and instantly my heart sunk. My heart sunk for the 50 victims of this terrible hate crime. My heart sunk for the LGBTQ community, and especially to the black and brown LGBTQ community in Orlando who were directly affected by the violence. My heart sunk for the Muslim community, who will feel the backlash of this horrible homophobic/transphobic violence. Being Muslim and queer are not mutually exclusive.

aS"Twenty-four hours after the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history, members of the LGBT community were out helping people confirm who was in Pulse nightclub and remembering the victims. View this image  BuzzFeed News / Dominic Holden ORLANDO When Enakai Mpire woke up on Sunday, the death toll from the shooting at Pulse nightclub was already at 20 people. A gunman had stormed one of the citys largest LGBT bars, taken hostages, and ultimately killed 49 and wounded dozens. Many were clinging to life at the hospital, unidentified. Mpire who works at Pulse, but was off that night headed to the Orlando Regional Medical Center. Since he knew Pulses staff and regulars, he said, I had to connect families with their missing children. Hundreds of people were there. Moms and dads were screaming, crying, looking for their sons, he said. It was like a murder scene on its own. People were passing out. People were punching walls. He asked the families for photos of missing kids and siblings, and then, on Facebook Live, he began to broadcast the pics, confirming whod been in the club that night for families and gathering clues about whod escaped, who was in surgery, and who had been killed. In the 24 hours since the shooting, the LGBT community of Orlando hasnt been cowed. Rather than retreating, they have emerged to cry together, declare solidarity, praise law enforcement, refuse to go into hiding and even dance. They want to strike fear into our hearts and make us afraid to go out, said Mpire, who uses his chosen name instead of his birth name. But Im not going to do that. The number of fatalities soon rose to 49, not including the gunman. But frustration at the hospital grew because very few names had been released by Sunday evening. Families didnt know whom to pray for and whom to mourn. Hospital staff circulated a form for them to fill out: victim name, victim date of birth, confirm if at club, relationship, next of kin, and phone. View this image  Cory Connell Facebook Relatives of Cory Connell filled out the form three times, pleading for word about his condition. His brother, Ryan Connell, heard from a detective that Cory had been shot just as he was leaving Pulse and was taken to the hospital in a police cruiser. Weve been assured over and over that hes here, Connell said Sunday evening. We have given them so many pictures. I havent gotten anything official since I got here. My parents are losing it right now, and no one is telling them anything, he continued. I have 20 members of my family in the hospital waiting area, waiting for any update on him. Countless more waited for word as the evening wore on. Ryan Quinlan Keelan, who said he works at gay strip club in Fort Lauderdale, knew three friends who had died, another in critical condition, and more who were still unaccounted for. I have two more that have been out of contact and didnt check in on fb as safe, Keelan in a Facebook message. Everyone here knows someone there. Everyone is visibly upset. Police had asked mourners not to hold a vigil on Sunday, because they didnt want to stretch already-taxed public safety resources or expose attendees to undue risk, LGBT advocates told BuzzFeed News. Instead, they focused on a press conference at the GLBT Center of Central Florida on North Mills Avenue. Support and condolence arrived in the form of dozens of pizzas, hundreds of cookies, doughnuts, coffee, and pans of Cuban sandwiches. Reporters were a fraction of the shoulder-to-shoulder crowd. It was primarily a pep rally, a venue for hugs, a statement that they wouldnt stay home. Can we make Pulse safe again? a woman asked from the back of room when it came time for questions. Gina Duncan, Equality Floridas director of transgender inclusion, stepped to the lectern. I think every person in this room has been to Pulse, she said to nods. It was a safe space. And we cannot let this deter us from going back. Staying home had been impossible for the crowd. Amelia Dixon-Hampton and her wife showed up first thing that morning. We are not a big gay community, she said. If something happens, everyone will come to the center. We have friends we havent heard from, she continued. The chances that so many people were shot and not knowing anybody is unlikely. Its unnerving. We are just waiting to see that entire list of names. But this day is a call to action. People havent started to grieve yet. That will come in the coming days. Another volunteer, Curtis Barresi, whos also an EMT, said one of his neighbors was killed and another was unaccounted for. Without a doubt, everyone in the gay and lesbian community of Orlando will know someone killed or injured in that shooting. Some people at Pulse that night were straight. Ryan Connell said his brother had gone out dancing at Latin night with his girlfriend. They just went for a good time, he said. I have called Corys phone more than a 100 times. I probably left him 50 voicemails. Late Monday morning, the Orlando Police Department updated a list of the deceased, including Cory James Connell, 21 years old. President Obama announced about an hour later that officials still did not know the motive for the attack, but that he was inspired by various extremist information that was disseminated over the internet. FBI Director James Comey also said he pledged allegiance to ISIS in a 911 call while in the nightclub, and the terrorist group took responsibility for the attack. According to the gunmans father in an interview with NBC, the sight of two men kissing agitated him. LGBT community members in Orlando acknowledged that while the motive is unclear, the attack was still on an LGBT bar the sort of place that has long been a refuge for people who couldnt always express their love and identity in public, which is particularly true in parts of conservative Florida and the South. View this image  David Goldman / AP The bottom line is that the LGBT community was attacked and the attacker had a history of homophobia, Duncan from Equality Florida told BuzzFeed News. She blamed the doctrine of ISIS, but also the rhetoric of conservative American politicians who oppose expanding LGBT rights. I firmly believe this is a direct manifestation of the hateful rhetoric that we are seeing on a national scale in our political process. It has been sweeping the country, from HB2 in North Carolina to school boards marginalizing transgender students, she said. Were seeing things like this happen on a national scale; there is a national dialogue of hate. The states most prominent conservative politician thinks that LGBT people were indeed targeted. In addition to killing Americans, he wanted to kill LGBT Americans, Sen. Marco Rubio said, standing a couple blocks from the crime scene on Sunday. I am convinced that was a part of it, in my mind, he continued in an interview with BuzzFeed News. But he disagreed with concerns that a conservative political agenda to block LGBT protections in the United States emboldens attacks like the one at Pulse. That is totally different than a terror attack, he said. ISIS throws gay people off of buildings. That is removed from the debate about laws about marriage and things of that nature. Twenty-three hours after the first shots, another one of the citys other big gay venues, Parliament House, became a de facto memorial site. A marquee on its deco neon sign read WE ARE PULSE UNBREAKABLE. A passel of cops stood guard out front. One drag queen did a number to Donna Summers Heaven Knows, lip-synching the words, Its not the way it should be. Huge bears gave huge bear hugs. Some people danced and cried at the same time. A middle-aged man with a white ribbon pinned to his T-shirt sat in the back of the club by himself. He held a tissue in one hand and a barely sipped a drink with the other. He cried. For more than 30 minutes, tears streaked down his cheeks and nose. Hed dab them dry. His lips would quiver. Hed stare down and cry more. Standing out front, under the lights of the neon sign, Javi White, a go-go boy at Pulse, said he was at his other job the previous night. If I had been working at Pulse, I would have been on the first box dancing. I know I would have been shot. I cried all day and night, he said. I was all by myself. Even though they told us not to congregate, I said, Fuck that. We wont stand down. We are not afraid. Thats why there are so many of us out tonight, to show we are not afraid. Being scared and alone in our house is not what we need to be doing. Friends in the gay community need to be together and show support and love for each other.

aS"The shooting was an intentional attack against LGBT people, the Guardian columnist said, before accusing the presenter and another guest of deflecting the attackers motive. The Guardian columnist, who was invited on to the show as a representative of the LGBT community to discuss British newspapers front pages, became increasingly frustrated as fellow guest Julia Hartley-Brewer and host Mark Longhurst appeared to deflect the apparent motive behind the shooting during the segmen. As many as 50 people died after a gunman named as 29-year-old Omar Mir Seddique Mateen of Port St. Lucie, Florida opened fire around 2am local time on Sunday in the busy gay nightclub Pulse. Fifty-three people were also injured in the attack, the single worst shooting atrocity in modern U.S. history. Mateens father, Mir Seddique, told journalists his son had become angry after he saw two men kissing one another, roughly two months ago. Seddique speculated that this may have been the motivation for the attack. On the segment, Jones said: At the end of the day this was a homophobic hate crime, as well as terrorism, and it has to be called out, as, I have to say, on Sky News and lots of news channels theres not been many LGBT voices that Ive heard. He continued: It is one of the worst atrocities committed against LGBT people in the western world for generations, and it has to be called out as such. Both Hartley-Brewer and Longhurst took exception to Jones comments that the attack was focused and targeted the LGBT community. Longhurst interjected: But its something thats carried out against human beings, isnt it? He returned to the theme by saying the shooting was an attack on the freedom of all people to try and enjoy themselves. The columnist became increasingly frustrated at both Hartley-Brewer and Longhurst, noting that had Mateen walked into a synagogue and murdered Jewish individuals, you would be talking about it as an anti-Semitic attack. This was a deliberate attack on LGBT people. Eventually, unbuttoning his microphone, Jones said: Ive had enough of this, and walked off the set. Fair play to Owen Jones for walking out of Sky News over the #OrlandoShooting, a vile hate crime against LGBT people. So much to respect for @OwenJones84. #OrlandoShooting needs to be called for what it is #HomophobicTerrorism https://t.co/9ubMGZNVFr Watching #SkyPapers and @OwenJones84 was absolutely right to refuse to participate any longer. Attempt to downplay homophobia disgusting Still coming to terms with the horrifying attack in Orlando. Switch on Twitter & see that appalling #skypapers clip. Well done @OwenJones84 Not often I'm lost for words, but this Sky paper review with @OwenJones84... I'm with Owen 100%. https://t.co/67HrZb1qeJ Infuriating to see Sky News pretending victims' sexuality was irrelevant to #Orlando. It wasn't. https://t.co/RAX1kZzaen I don't blame @OwenJones84 at all for walking out on Sky Papers - this made my blood boil just watching https://t.co/ckitRHdzyL 100% behind @OwenJones84. Watched this agape / angry as hell. Just astonishing. https://t.co/iLmmjWd406 50 people were murdered simply for being gay. I think we should all be angry about THAT, not about some contrived offence taken on a tv show Trust me, I will not be apologising. I said absolutely nothing for which I need to apologise. https://t.co/1IWk3pjiBA Orlando was both a terrorist attack and a homophobic attack on LGBT people - this really isn't hard. Orlando was both a terrorist attack and a homophobic attack on LGBT people. It was both the worst mass shooting in US history, and the worst targeted mass killing of LGBT people in the western world since the Holocaust. It is possible for an atrocity to be more than one thing at the same time. You are not compelled to select one option or the other. Life with both its horrors and its joys is incredibly complicated, and we have a rich language able to capture its complexities. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The differences between performers in and out of drag is more than just skin-deep. View this image  Laura Gallant / BuzzFeed Laura Gallant / BuzzFeed What are the three things youd take with you if you were stranded on an island? James: A lifetime supply of marijuana to keep me entertained, Id take art supplies so that I could stay creative and maybe leave some amazing artwork for someone to discover after Ive died, and my cat. Maxi: I would be in survival mode, so that would be eyelash glue, safety pins, and hairspray. Then I could probably stay on the island for a fair time without my makeup getting too ratchet. If you could freeze your life at any age, what age would it be? James: I probably wouldnt pick one. Im up for the journey and Ill always want something else and Ill always be chasing that other thing. So I doubt Id be content enough to be like, Right, Ill just sit here now. Maxi: I feel like drag, you get given these very brief moments of intense glamour and intense spotlight and opulence, and theyre not real at all, theyre complete fantasy. But to get stuck at a Life Ball, for instance, would be pretty fun. With a lifetime supply of gowns. If you could be famous for anything, what would it be? James: If I could be famous for anything it would be as an artist of some kind. To be recognised as an artist. Maxi: I would like to be most famous for being Londons tallest drag queen. What is your favourite alcoholic drink? James: Out of drag I dont really drink that much at all. It would probably be marijuana-infused alcohol. Maxi: In drag it would be a brandy and Coke. I drink a lot more gin and tonics, but I do like a brandy and Coke and if you want to get me trashed, thats what Ill be drinking. If you could be an animal, what would you be? James: Im hoping to come back in my next life as a cat. I think sleeping 20 hours a day and then meowing for everything else would be pretty nice, and Id look cute 100% of the time. Maxi: Id probably be some weird bird of paradise. Some overly flamboyant, very colourful, squawky bird that when the first time you saw it youd be like whoa, but then after a while youd think it was actually quite annoying. Maxi More can be found on Instagram and Facebook. View this image  Laura Gallant / BuzzFeed  LMG Laura Gallant / BuzzFeed Whats the first thing youd buy with a million pounds? Jacob: The whole Gucci collection. All Alessandro Michele Gucci. Like literally anything hes ever touched. Dinah: Duct tape. Id also love those beautiful marabou-sleeved dressing gowns. Where would your ideal holiday be? Jacob: Id pick somewhere really far away, like Madagascar. Somewhere Ive never been before. Dinah: Straight to New York. Thats where Dinah was born. What is your ideal Friday night? Jacob: Jacob would be with friends in a bar or at someones house chilling, with lots of people there and getting quite pissed. A house party or something. Dinah: Dinah would be just glamour. Full-on, like, latex dress. If you could be famous for anything, what would it be? Jacob: As Jacob Id like to be a famous musician or musicologist. Or some kind of speaker. Dinah: My dream is to be invited to the Met Gala, so I need to be famous for that. Just being pretty. Just really fucking pretty. And like, best tuck in the world. Whats your favourite movie? Jacob: The Rocky Horror Picture Show or Priscilla, Queen of the Desert my first forays into the world of drag sitting behind my grainy VHS in Essex. Dinah: Romy and Micheles High School Reunion. I think that movie is iconic and their outfits are inspired at the end. And the interpretive dance is possibly the best thing Ive seen in my life. Dinah Lux can be found on Twitter, Instagram, and TEDx Talks.  View this image  Laura Gallant / BuzzFeed Laura Gallant / BuzzFeed What is the first thing youd buy with a million pounds? Andrew: Property, if a million pounds is even enough to buy property in London these days. Virgin: I think Virgin has everything, shes the mother of God. But I think shed just want to spend it. Shed just want to get rid of it. So shed go on a really epic shopping spree and then probably go on holiday. Which member of the Spice Girls would you be? Andrew: I think Id be Scary because I tend to be a bit of a freak. I can be a weirdo and proud of it. Virgin: Virgin would be Posh. All those stoic, icy stares shed totally be Posh. If you could freeze your life at any age, what age would it be? Andrew: Id freeze myself at the age of 4 or 6. I feel like I had my shit together when I was 4. I was confident and I didnt give a shit. Then high school happens and bullying happens, and I became really scared to be myself. So I feel like now my life is about regaining what I lost in that really pure time. Virgin: I think for Virgin, the time she would freeze would also be childhood. What is your favourite colour? Andrew: I like black. Its like everything altogether, and theres so many different shades of it. Theres so much you can do with it. It says a lot. Virgin: Black. Its powerful. What is your favourite possession? Andrew: My wedding ring. Ive been married for eight years and Im very happy. My life got much better when I met my husband. Virgin: Itd be easy to say her headpieces because they are fabulous. But I think for her, it would be her sacred heart. Virgin Xtravaganzah can be found on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. View this image  Laura Gallant / BuzzFeed Laura Gallant / BuzzFeed If you could be best friends with any celebrity, who would it be? Gordon: Gale Weathers, from the Scream movies, because shes a boss and hair goals. VAG: I dont think theres anybody that would be comparable. I think VAG is very much her own person and she doesnt need anybody else or validation. She would be the person that celebrities come to to be her friend. What word would your best friend use to describe you? Gordon: Probably honest. Im very black and white, theres no grey area. Im very honest and theres a directness. VAG: VAG would probably be described more as an enigma. Shes something that cant quite be explained. On a scale of 15, how confident are you? Gordon: Gordon is very much a 1. As Gordon I can be very shy, head down, and have very awkward conversations with people. VAG: VAG would be a 5 because shes not asking for validation. And thats why I did this [drag], because it gave me more confidence. If Im in drag, I can speak to anybody and show my body off. Its a very weird transition. Which member of the Spice Girls would you be? Gordon: I always liked Victoria. VAG: All five of them represent different aspects of being a woman and I think VAG as a creation embodies that. I dont think VAG could choose; shed have to be all five. If you could freeze your life at any age, what would it be? Gordon: At the moment Id freeze now and I wouldnt change, because Im in a very good place for the first time in a very long time. Im very happy as I am. VAG: VAG is timeless. Shes constant development, so I dont think you could freeze her. Shell keep on going forever. The Notorious V.A.G can be found on Twitter and Instagram.  View this image  Laura Gallant / BuzzFeed  Laura Gallant / BuzzFeed If you could freeze your life at any age, what age would it be? Thom: Its funny because as Thom my age isnt frozen, but I feel like Vanitys is and will be for at least another decade. I think shes, like, 31 but I think shell stay 31 even when Im 41. Vanity: I think shed refuse to accept the premise of the question. Shed probably say something like, Dont be so ridiculous, why would we freeze time? Surely if we had the ability to do so wed wind it back. If you could be best friends with any celebrity, who would it be? Thom: I love Paloma Faith. I actually think we get on really well. She and I were both at a party that Paris Hilton threw a couple of years ago and she ran over to me while I was in drag. I had huge flowers in my hair, so I looked Paloma-esque and she was like, You look amazing! Vanity: Vanity doesnt really have much use for friends. She finds them to be an inconvenience, too full of opinion. On a scale of 15, how confident are you? Thom: If 5 is the highest level of confidence and that means you can go up to anybody and ask them any question, then Im 5. I think confidence is a trick you tell yourself. Confidence doesnt mean youre comfortable with things, it just means youre able to do it anyway. Vanity: Vanity would also answer 5. Or perhaps even 7. What is your favourite pizza topping? Thom: I really like jalapeo, spicy thangs. But also Im one of those annoying gluten-free people so it has to be gluten-free and very, very thin. Vanity: Vanity only eats for sustenance. The pleasures of fine dining are strictly social for her. If you could be famous for anything, what would it be? Thom: I want to make people laugh. I want to also move them. Thats why I do the types of shows that I do: reminding people that theres stuff to laugh about, but also not to laugh at the expense of experiencing your melancholy too. Vanity: Well, Vanity already is internationally renowned. Shes an icon. A global diva. Shed probably like even greater fame and notoriety for killing Mariah Carey. Vanity Von Glow can be found on Twitter, YouTube, and her website.  View this image  Laura Gallant / BuzzFeed Laura Gallant / BuzzFeed If you could freeze your life at any age, what age would it be? Shane: I would probably freeze my last year of university, because I had too much fun. Shay: As ShayShay I wouldnt want to freeze because I feel like coming up, theres going to be even bigger things. Im doing bigger things every week, achieving new goals that I didnt think Id be doing for years. I cant freeze because Im on the move. What is your favourite possession? Shane: The most valuable possession I have is my two passports, because I have an American passport and an Irish passport. The world is a little less closed for me. Shay: Im always moving, so objects have less meaning to me. But both in and out of drag, my favourite possession is my great grandparents kimonos, which nobody knew existed until after my grandparents had died. What is your favourite movie? Shane: Eyes Wide Shut. Stanley Kubrick freaks me the fuck out but I love it. Im a sucker for cinematography. Shay: Probably Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. It was one of the first times I saw drag queens beyond just drag queens. You get to see them behind the scenes and their real struggles. It was the first time Id seen a story about someone who was trans. That blew my mind. If you could live anywhere in the world, where would it be? Shane: Im a Californian hippie at heart. Im such a chilled bro sometimes that I would want to live back in California, on the cliffs of Marin where theres the beach and the woodlands. And then Id never have to deal with society. Shay: As ShayShay I have to be in a big city, and right now London is where Im meant to be. What is the first thing youd buy with a million pounds? Shane: I would buy my mum a house in Ireland so she could move back there. She lives in California but she wants to retire to Ireland. Shay: I would hire the most amazing seamstress and I would have them make me all the costumes Ive ever wanted. What Ive realised is I dont have the money for it and in the end people are going to remember my performance and not what Im wearing. If Im not memorable, clothes arent going to help the situation. ShayShay can be found on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. View this image  Laura Gallant / BuzzFeed Laura Gallant / BuzzFeed Which member of the Spice Girls would you be? Dom: Geri, because Im gobby and feminist and a lot dumber than I think I am. Cola: Cola would be Geri too but I think she has Posh Spice tendencies. She likes a bit of fashion. If you could freeze your life at any age, what age would it be? Dom: Just any age before I die is good. Im terrified of death. Cola: Cola is not terrified of death because she doesnt exist on the physical plain permanently. She doesnt really have to worry about that sort of thing. Shes allowed to live forever. If you could be best friends with any celebrity, who would it be? Dom: Id like to be best friends with Rufus Wainwright, because we could both talk about having deep, laconic voices that a lot of people get sick of. Wed bond over that. Cola: I think Michelle Pfeiffer, but she has to remain in character as Catwoman the whole time. What is your favourite swear word? Dom: I know its really bad, but cunt. I fucking love a good c-bomb. Cola: Cola is already a c-bomb. Shes like Hi, my names Cola, my jizz will rot your teeth. What is your favourite possession? Dom: My Kindle. I love the Kindle because I fucking love reading.

aS"Ive never been out. But today I stand proudly and publicly with my siblings of all genders around the world. LGBT people tell BuzzFeed News why the massacre prompted them to speak out. He tweeted the disclosure, writing, Ive never been out. But today I stand proudly and publicly with my brothers and sisters of all genders around the world. View this image  Looking at the news yesterday made me so profoundly sad about the invasion of the sanctity of a safe place, said Smith. And it made me feel as though it was really important for a little bit more visibility and for people to understand that everybody needs to be safe, and that everywhere there are people who are affected and who are part of this community. He added that he wanted to convey the idea that the LGBT community is bigger and wider than many realise, to stop bigots being able to marginalise the community. The mass murder in the early hours of Sunday morning of 50 people in the LGBT Pulse nightclub in Orlando triggered a deep response in Smith. I felt so connected to it, that I thought it was time. He said he wanted to make it known that I felt more connected than perhaps would have been immediately apparent. View this image  Everybodys been really lovely, he said. I havent had any adverse reactions. People I dont know and have never met have said theyre proud of me and appreciate it, and that makes life slightly easier. Ive sent the tweet and various messages to my closest friends. Theyve been lovely as well asking question but doing so nicely. Theyve just asked if my is wife OK. Theyve just said It changes nothing, which is lovely. It gives you the reassurance you want. Smith is aware, however, that he will still need to tell people who didnt see the tweet or his emails. Itll be a two-part, or multi-part process. There are very few people who I know well in real life who I knew before I was on Twitter. So the litmus test will be the next stage which is telling the rest of the world who I know. He added that hell also tell his family. If Id been in a relationship with a man or a trans person I would have been immediately visible as part of this community but it feels very invisible to be in a straight relationship. Thats not to say that it doesnt come with privilege, which it shouldnt do but it certainly is a factor in terms of wanting to be seen. Life for LGBT people who are from the UAE where homosexuality is punishable by death is not easy, he said. Smith added he had been thinking about coming out for some time, but the hideous scale of people being targeted specifically in a space in Orlando a haven was the final straw. I came out to my mum. It went really well. @PatrickStrud I saw what happened and looked at Twitter for about 8 hours seeing all of the grief. I realised that this was the time to @PatrickStrud offer my support and since I thought I'd never be 100% ready so I came out to my mum. Im extremely proud of him and I feel so honoured that he told me, Logans mother Rhona MacCormick told BuzzFeed News. Im extremely pleased he has the maturity to recognise how he feels and stands up for what he believes. Im really happy hes done this. #GaysBreakTheInternet I guess I'm not scared to come out as bi anymore lol my family/relatives will hate me for this I would just like to say that being queer is a very beautiful thing and we should be proud of who we are, she said. Members of the LGBTQIA+ are very beautiful, talented and very artistic and kids who have families who support them for who they are should be very thankful.  #GaysBreakTheInternet #PansBreakTheInternet your favourite pan princess says hi  Hi mum heres a thing you didnt know about me! said Oceane. #gaysbreaktheinternet violence will not silence us to share our love As a gay couple in a world full of hate we share so much love between the two of us and nothing as violent as the shooting in Orlando will silence it. What happened this past weekend is traumatizing for many and painful for the entire gay community. Our sorrows go out to each and every one of the victims and their families/friends weeping over a death they could not escape. Violence will never win. It may defeat, but will never conquer. Were all so strong and will stand up to violence and give back twice the amount of love, our thoughts go out to everyone whos lives have been affected by this disaster, but love conquers hate. Love strong and love always! #GaysBreakTheInternet I won't live in fear bc of some stupid homophobic people.I'm proud of who I am &always will be I would like to tell the world to never live in fear because if they do then that means that they won. We need to stand together as one. #gaysbreaktheinternet because our rights aren't a debate issue. because we exist. because we are important  Theres an extra stigma when youre LGBTQ and non-white. Its important to raise awareness to this matter more especially since the shooting happened while there was a Latino night and during immigrant heritage month. Thank you for your beauty, your brains & your determination to make your voice be valued #queersbreaktheinternet I would just like to say that Im a bisexual woman Im so grateful to have my incredible queer friends and family, said Eliza, 25. The attack in Orlando is an atrocious act of homophobic violence. We must speak up, we must not be silenced. This is a political attack and we must value queer people. The lives taken were largely queer people of colour who are more marginalised than any other group. It should have been a celebration for queer Latinos but it was instead a night of destruction. #queerandstillhere can't bring us down  Being yourself should not be a courageous act and Im very proud to be in such a strong community. i'm proud of my sexuality #GaysBreakTheInternet Why would you rather see two men holding guns than holding hands? Bc I consider being a part of the LGBT+ community a blessing and am a proud queer boy #queersbreaktheinternet We have to work together as a community to get rid of homophobes and LGBT+ hate even though it might take a while; we just need to be patient and create a safe environment for everyone no matter what race they are, what religion they practice, how old they are, LGBT+ or not everyone has the right to feel safe. no shame in my game n if you care you a lame #gaysbreaktheinternet  Regardless of your sexuality, religion, ethnicity a human with a beating heart does not deserve to die for being who they are. Just because I do not share the same beliefs as the person beside me doesnt mean I love them any less. These people went to a place where they knew they could live, full of freedom, laughter, love and happiness and their innocent and beautiful lives were taken. Love is love and hate can take us down but love will bring us back up again!! This tragedy broke my heart and my thoughts and prayers are with Orlando during this time. The world needs to change. y'all are stuck w us forever #QueerAndStillHere UPDATE Identifying details of one of the participants in this story were changed and anonymised, along with the removal of pictures, as a safeguarding measure.

aS"Because we wont stop loving. View this image  Omar Mir Seddique Mateen Mateen told NBC that a few months ago, Omar was angered by two men kissing in Miami, especially because it took place in front of his wife and 3-year-old son. They were kissing each other and touching each other, and he said: Look at that. In front of my son, they are doing that, said the father. And then we were in the mens bathroom, and men were kissing each other. The elder Mateen told NBC that the experience affected his son, leading some to speculate the incident could have set the gunman off.

aS"The gunman behind Orlandos mass shooting was Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old U.S. citizen. England and Russias soccer teams could be disqualified from the 2016 European Championship over violence. And hit musical Hamilton dominated the Tonys with 11 awards overall. HERE ARE THE TOP STORIES The shooter was Omar Mateen, 29, of Port St. Lucie, Florida. He was a professional security officer, had a license to carry a firearm, and legally purchased the guns he used. He was killed by authorities at Pulse nightclub. Shortly before the attack, Mateen called 911 and pledged his allegiance to ISIS, an FBI official said. The FBI interviewed him twice in 2013 and 2014 for possible terrorist motivations and connections. The shooters ex-wife, Sitora Yusufiy, who met Mateen online, said he was physically abusive toward her. They were married for four months until Yusufiys family rescued her after Mateen kept her hostage. President Barack Obama called the attack an act of terror and an act of hate. By Sunday afternoon, the City of Orlando began to release the names of the victims on its website. Heres what we know about them so far. Vigils honoring the victims were held across the world on Sunday evening, including at Manhattans historic Stonewall Inn, which will soon become the first national monument to the LGBT rights movement in the U.S. Newspapers around the world mourned the victims on their front pages. And heres how world leaders, LGBT people, and celebrities all reacted to the shooting. View this image  Steve Nesius / Reuters The suspect was identified as 20-year-old James Howell of Indiana. Santa Monica police arrested him after responding to a report of a suspected prowler who was knocking on a residents doors and windows, BuzzFeed News reports. The officers then inspected his car and found a high-powered rifle, ammunition, and other dangerous materials, including tannerite, which can be used to create a pipe bomb. The Los Angeles Sheriffs Department said that the FBI is investigating any connection between the suspect and the Pride event, at which attendees marched on in solidarity after the Orlando massacre.

aS'Airbnb, which is facing a lawsuit for racial discrimination, removed a host over a year after she was reported for denying a trans woman a room on the platform. View this image  Nurphoto / Getty Images Shadi Petosky, a trans woman, was denied a room on Airbnb after she informed her would-be host that she is trans. As of today, that host has been removed from the Airbnb platform, BuzzFeed News has learned. After Petosky told the host in question that she is trans, the host canceled her reservation out of what she described as concern for the discomfort of her teenaged son. I was denied @Airbnb because I disclosed that I\'m trans. Airbnb did nothing. Had I not disclosed I\'d be "dishonest" Petosky says she reported the host via a formal complaint to Airbnb when the incident originally happened, over a year ago, but never heard back from the company. On Monday, Nick Papas, a spokesperson for Airbnb, told BuzzFeed News in an email that Discrimination has no place in the Airbnb community. We are removing this host from Airbnb. Petosky told BuzzFeed News that she posted about it now because theyve been getting more scrutiny recently, adding that she had no idea it was going to blow up as much as it did. She has previously spoken out on discriminatory treatment by TSA agents at the airport, said on Twitter that she informs hosts that she is trans out of concern for her own safety. Ppl don\'t seem to understand that trans femme people are considered lying monsters who deserve whatever happens to them for tricking folks Airbnb is a public participant in Pride Month; the companys current pinned tweet on Twitter celebrates the colorful fingerprints of our community using the hashtag #HostsWithPride. Wow rainbow-fied logo and pride month pinned tweet? Weird that Airbnb has no LGBTQ non discrimination policy. https://t.co/KmAHcjUEpY However, Petosky pointed out on Twitter, the company does not have a specific policy that protects LGBT guests from discrimination, though it does have a general discrimination policy that mentions sexual orientation. They should definitely have a universal nondiscrimination policy as part of their platform, she told BuzzFeed News. It could be stricter than local laws, and make it so the people who are running these businesses have to comply with these policies so that the customer feels like they have recourse. On Twitter, someone asked about the possibility of filing a lawsuit against Airbnb, but on the phone with BuzzFeed News, Petosky said the process would be too emotionally draining. A black man from Virginia recently sued the company for discrimination under the Civil Rights Act and Fair Housing Act, among other things. This morning, ahead of its annual developer conference in San Francisco, Airbnb announced the launch of Airbnb Connect, a diversity program aimed at recruiting minorities and women. Petosky told BuzzFeed News that she rarely uses Airbnb, and that although she has had good experiences with the platform in the past, she generally prefers hotels. You know that no one is going to have any issue with you when you arrive, she said. You know theres not going to be a problem, because they have the regulations. I feel more comfortable going to a hotel for sure. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS'If you want the real answer for what an abomination is, look no further. View this image  "According to the bible..." Basically the remark was that homosexuality was a sin according to the Bible. If you really want to talk about what the Bible considers an abomination we can. I\'m well versed in this word. If you turn to Proverbs chapter 6, verse 17 you will see that lying is an abomination, yet y\'all on here lying about y\'all dusty lives daily Turn to Isaiah chapter 66. Here we learn that eating unclean things is an abomination aka pork & I\'m sure one of you sucking a rib bone now. Leviticus chapter 11 verse 12 states that we shouldn\'t eat shell fish. It\'s an abomination. Put that crab leg down. For all you wine and liquor drinkers, you should probably check out Proverbs chapter 20. You might just be an abomination. And ladies. If you happen to divorce your husband, get with another man and then decide to get back with your husband. Think again. How can you, a defiled divorced woman judge someone for being gay when your Lord considers you unclean? And don\'t get me started on all you dusty cheaters out here because y\'all are abominations in several different ways 95% of you niggas have beat your meat enough times to send your whole family to hell. First Corinthians chapter 6 will explain. You straight dudes ever watched porn or looked at a woman and thought about how sexy she was? Matthew chapter 5 I know you love your rolexes and your pearls and your chains etc, but unfortunately you may just go to hell. Go read Timothy chapter 2. You got tattoos on your body coming for the gay community when your God said you shall "not print any marks upon you: I am the LORD." Again for my ladies. You have the nerve to say homosexuality is against the bible and that same book says you shouldn\'t speak in church. Look at the tag on your clothes? Is it a polyester or fabric blend? Because according to Leviticus chapter 19 y\'all going to hell too. Leviticus chapter 19 also states that y\'all shouldn\'t get round haircuts or trim ya beards so... Leviticus is a pretty interesting book. Chapter 3 says you shouldn\'t eat things like steaks or burgers, but here y\'all are. So now that you\'ve actually seen what the bible says about abominations, who\'s going to heaven? I\'ll wait. View this image  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .

aS"Thousands of people gathered to support the LGBT community on Sunday in West Hollywood. View this image  Claudia Koerner / BuzzFeed WEST HOLLYWOOD Rainbows, music, and cheers filled Santa Monica Boulevard on Sunday as Los Angeles turned out to celebrate Pride and stand defiantly with the victims of the attack on gay club-goers in Orlando. Event organizers had expected 400,000 people to attend the L.A. Pride festivities in West Hollywood over the weekend. But on Sunday morning, some attendees of the annual Pride parade said they werent sure what the mood of the event would be following the Orlando massacre. On the parade route, though, the spirit of community proved to be infectious. When I left the house I was feeling like this would be really weird to come together and be so joyous after something so tragic, said Erin Keegan, who walked in the parade with dog-rescue group Angel City Pit Bulls. But once I got here theres already a great camaraderie and support between everybody and love between everybody. Before the parade began with a roar from the motorcycles of Dykes on Bikes, local leaders assured the crowd that Los Angeles was safe. Though man armed with explosives had earlier said he was going to Pride, he had been arrested, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said. The mayor called for the community to carry on amid tragedy. In the face of hate, hold someone today, Garcetti said. View this image  Claudia Koerner / BuzzFeed No other credible threats were made against L.A. Pride, an FBI spokesperson said, and an event organizer added that metal detectors were in place for the music festival planned for later in the day. As scary as it is, you cant hide, said Grapes Wasserman, 39, wearing a shirt with the message We love you Orlando emblazoned over a rainbow flag. Wasserman and her wife attend every year and brought their kids to the parade. Though they didnt have a connection to the victims of the Orlando shooting, it felt personal. At the Where the Bears Are float, Shannon Ward, 39, said he hoped people would enjoy the parade without fear and simply be themselves even with the earlier threat of a gunman. Fortunately the police caught him, he said. But were going to continue to celebrate, have great spirit, and carry on. Carrying on with their performance was important for the members of the So Cal Pride Color Guard, said Bobby Vega, 26. He said the group aimed to show they stood with Orlando. We are hoping to provide some entertainment, some cheer, some smiles out there, he said.

We felt really unsafe, and especially bringing him out here, we werent sure if it was a good idea, Brian Coughlin said. But I think after we got here and saw the people we knew. When youre part of a community I think you feel safer, he said. Bryce Coughlin said his family was there to support their local community as well as others who were grieving around the U.S. Its just a time to come together, he said, and celebrate what we still have. 4. 50 Killed At Orlando Gay Nightclub In Deadliest U.S. Mass Shooting buzzfeed.com 5.

Santa Monica police arrested Howell after responding to a report of a suspected prowler, who was knocking on a residents doors and windows, Seabrooks said. When officers spoke with the suspect, he told them he was waiting for a friend.

Authorities told BuzzFeed News the vehicle had Indiana license plates. The Los Angeles Sheriffs Department confirmed in a statement the man was in possession of weapons and other dangerous material. Howell is being held on weapons and explosive materials charges, Seabrooks said. Seabrooks initially said that Howell told a Santa Monica police officer after the arrest that he wanted to harm the pride event in nearby West Hollywood, but later said that information was incorrect. The sheriffs department said that the FBI is investigating any connection between the suspect and the pride event. Out of an abundance of caution, we have enhanced our security presence for the event and have tactical units at the ready to prevent and respond to any circumstances, the sheriffs department said. View this image  Jon Passantino / BuzzFeed News Speaking before the start of the festival Sunday, Mayor Eric Garcetti said he believed that the arrest was completely unrelated to the Orlando massacre.

Without acceptance, there will be violence. this is a perfect example of how coming out, going to gay prides and just existing as a gay person in society is still an act of bravery I haven\'t openly tweeted this but I am proud to be gay & I hope to someday wake up in a world where this part of me doesn\'t affect my safety It\'s easy to forget it\'s still an act of bravery to get up and be yourself and proud each day. The world has lost some light today. Such tragedy does not waver my pride. I am gay and I am proud. My heart goes out to the victims of this horrible incident #Pulse Orlando reminds us why even those of us disillusioned by the corporatization of gay #pride still insist on commemorating what we fought for. As proud & open as I am about being gay, I\'d be lying if I said something like Orlando happening isn\'t in the back of my mind every Pride I am black and I am gay and I am woman. I am reminded of my mortality everyday. I have yet to invincible, I don\'t think I ever will. People wonder why my wife and I don\'t always hold hands in public, why we don\'t kiss in public. Being gay, loving each other can be deadly. I am a woman. I am black. I am queer. I am not safe. Anywhere. I wish I could donate blood - but as a gay man, my blood is still "deferred" - so infuriating. #PrayersForOrlando What\'s infuriating as a gay man watching 50 people killed from your community is that I can\'t donate blood due to law. #PrayForOrlando #LGBT Deeply moved that in the face of tragedy Orlando & Americans everywhere are coming together to give blood, love & support.This is who we are Sobbing. Waking up to the news of the mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando. I\'m so sick, sad, scared and angry. I\'m praying for victims\' families. If this was indeed a hate crime, lawmakers issuing thoughts & prayers must also think about their statements & policy toward LGBT Americans. I\'m terrified for my kid to grow up in this world This attack has come during our celebration of Pride. Now more than ever we must stand together and say #LoveConquersHate. I\'m terrified for my kid to grow up in this world My heart goes out to the victims and their families. Our community has suffered a tremendous loss. We must stand together more than ever. Heart. Broken. #orlando :(.... Devastated for our friends and family in the queer community.

aS"At least 49 people were killed on June 12 after a gunman stormed Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. View this image  Via univision.com A man identified only as Miguel claimed in an interview Tuesday he was Omar Mateens lover for two months, and that the gunman in the deadly Orlando shooting had rage against Puerto Ricans. In an interview with Noticias Univision, the man told the Spanish-language newscast he had been questioned by the FBI, and gave agents information about when and where he met Mateen. We never took a picture together, but it wasnt because I didnt want to, he told Univisions Maria Elena Salinas. One time we were in bed together and I took my phone to take a selfie and he grabbed my arm and told me not to do it because we werent a couple. Univision noted they have not been able to independently verify Miguels story, but that the FBI did confirm officials have been questioning the man. Ive spent about four days of hell because my phone wont stop ringing, he said about his contact with investigators. The man, whose voice was disguised and appeared in a video interview with what appeared to be a mask and makeup, also said Mateen was attracted to Latinos but disliked Puerto Ricans. In an accompanying article, Miguel reportedly told Salinas that Mateen didnt like Puerto Ricans because of an unprotected threesome he had with men he met at Pulse. One of the men, Mateen had told him, had HIV. He hated Puerto Rican gays because of the bad things they did to him, Miguel reportedly said. View this image  Carlo Allegri / Reuters Omar Mateen visited the Pulse nightclub in Orlando hours before returning with weapons to carry out the attack that left 49 people dead, multiple news outlets reported Tuesday. Mateen paid an entry fee, got a wristband, and went inside the club hours before the shooting began, ABC News reported Tuesday. Investigators believe Mateen may have been checking security before the attack, according to CNN. The new details fill in some of the timeline gaps on what the gunman in the deadliest attack since 9/11 did on the day of the shooting. Prior to visiting the club, Mateen reportedly went to work, and later stopped by his fathers home. At some point afterward, Mateen made the two-hour drive from his home in Fort Pierce to Orlando. According to CNN, Mateens wife, Noor Salman, told investigators he left home angry and with a bag of guns. View this image  Phelan M. Ebenhack / AP Officials on Monday said Omar Mateen, the gunman who killed 49 people in an attack on a gay Orlando nightclub on June 12, did not fire a shot for almost three hours after his initial rampage. Authorities on Monday released transcripts of calls Mateen made to law enforcement during the massacre, creating the clearest official timeline yet of what occurred during the hours-long attack. 10. Read the full story here. buzzfeed.com Breaking: DOJ reverses course on Orlando 911 call redaction. The Department of Justice and FBI on Monday afternoon reversed their decision to release a censored transcript of the 911 call Mateen made from Pulse nightclub, and instead released the full transcript. Unfortunately, the unreleased transcript that named the terrorist organizations and leaders have caused an unnecessary distraction from the hard work that the FBI and our law enforcement partners have already been doing to investigate this heinous crime, a DOJ spokesperson said. Orlando Dispatcher (OD): Emergency 911, this is being recorded. Omar Mateen (OM): In the name of God the Merciful, the beneficial [in Arabic] OD: What? OM: Praise be to God, and prayers as well as peace be upon the prophet of God [in Arabic]. I let you know, Im in Orlando and I did the shootings. OD: Whats your name? OM: My name is I pledge of allegiance to [ISIS chief] Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi of Islamic State. OD: Ok, Whats your name? OM: I pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi may God protect him [in Arabic], on behalf of the Islamic State. OD: Alright, where are you at? OM: In Orlando. OD: Where in Orlando? [End of call.] The president should reverse his administration's decision to censor the #Orlando shooter's 911 transcript  View this image  Gerardo Mora / Getty Images The FBI on Monday released partial transcripts of telephone calls Orlando nightclub shooter Omar Mateen made during his rampage on June 12. Out of respect for the victims of this horrific tragedy, law enforcement will not be releasing audio of the shooters 911 calls at this time, nor will law enforcement be releasing audio or transcripts of the calls made by victims at the Pulse nightclub during the incident, the FBI said in a statement. Here is the full statement: The following is based on Orlando Police Department (OPD) radio communication (times are approximate): 2:02 a.m.: OPD call transmitted multiple shots fired at Pulse nightclub.  2:04a.m.: Additional OPD officers arrived on scene. 2:08 a.m.: Officers from various law enforcement agencies made entrance to Pulse and engaged the shooter. 2:18 a.m.: OPD S.W.A.T. (Special Weapons & Tactics) initiated a full call-out. 2:35 a.m.: Shooter contacted a 911 operator from inside Pulse. The call lasted approximately 50 seconds, the details of which are set out below: Orlando Police Dispatcher (OD) Shooter (OM) OD: Emergency 911, this is being recorded. OM: In the name of God the Merciful, the beneficial [in Arabic] OD: What? OM: Praise be to God, and prayers as well as peace be upon the prophet of God [in Arabic]. I let you know, Im in Orlando and I did the shootings. OD: Whats your name? OM: My name is I pledge of allegiance to [omitted]. OD: Ok, Whats your name? OM: I pledge allegiance to [omitted] may God protect him [in Arabic], on behalf of [omitted]. OD: Alright, where are you at? OM: In Orlando. OD: Where in Orlando? [End of call.] Shortly thereafter, the shooter engaged in three conversations with OPDs Crisis Negotiation Team.) 2:48 a.m.:First crisis negotiation call occurred lasting approximately nine minutes. 3:03 a.m.:Second crisis negotiation call occurred lasting approximately 16 minutes. 3:24 a.m.:Third crisis negotiation call occurred lasting approximately three minutes. In these calls, the shooter, who identified himself as an Islamic soldier, told the crisis negotiator that he was the person who pledged his allegiance to [omitted], and told the negotiator to tell America to stop bombing Syria and Iraq and that is why he was out here right now. When the crisis negotiator asked the shooter what he had done, the shooter stated, No, you already know what I did. The shooter continued, stating, There is some vehicle outside that has some bombs, just to let you know. You people are gonna get it, and Im gonna ignite it if they try to do anything stupid. Later in the call with the crisis negotiator, the shooter stated that he had a vest, and further described it as the kind they used in France. The shooter later stated, In the next few days, youre going to see more of this type of action going on. The shooter hung up and multiple attempts to get in touch with him were unsuccessful. 4:21 a.m.: OPD pulled an air conditioning unit out of a Pulse dressing room window for victims to evacuate. (While the FBI will not be releasing transcripts of OPD communication with victims, significant information obtained from those victims allowed OPD to gain knowledge of the situation inside Pulse.) 4:29 a.m.: As victims were being rescued, they told OPD the shooter said he was going to put four vests with bombs on victims within 15 minutes. (An immediate search of the shooters vehicle on scene and inside Pulse ultimately revealed no vest or improvised explosive device.) 5:02 a.m.: OPD SWAT and OCSO Hazardous Device Team began to breach wall with explosive charge and armored vehicle to make entry. 5:14 a.m.: OPD radio communication stated that shots were fired. 5:15 a.m.: OPD radio communication stated that OPD engaged the suspect and the suspect was reported down. Based on OPD radio communications, there were no reports of shots being fired inside Pulse between the initial exchange of gunfire between responding officers and shooter, and the time of the final breach. During this time, the shooter communicated with an OPD 911 operator and an OPD crisis negotiator, and OPD radio communications reported that victims were being rescued. The FBI urges the public to provide information about the shooter and any contact they may have had with him. Since the release of the FBIs Seeking Information poster, the FBI has received thousands of tips. The FBI will investigate every tip. View this image  Reuters The gunman behind the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil since 9/11 wanted to be a correctional officer, but flunked out of the academy after falling asleep in class and making disturbing comments. In April 2007, Omar Mateen joked with a classmate about bringing a gun to class, prompting a superior to recommend he be removed from the academy. The Orlando gunmans failed attempt at becoming a correctional officer at Florida jails and prisons was detailed in a series of documents released Friday by the Florida Department of Corrections. The records show Mateen wanted to be a correctional officer in 2007, but he was written several times for falling asleep in class. In one incident, the young recruit dozed off at the gun range, while he and his team waited their turn. View this image  Florida Department of Corrections In another incident, Mateen was written up for leaving the campus and not telling any of his superiors. The most concerning incident, however, occurred on April19, 2007. While the class was given a 15 minute break, Omar Mateen approached me laughing saying that if he was to bring a gun to school would I tell anybody, one recruit wrote in a memo. I looked at him and turned away. Officials finally recommended that Mateen be dismissed. His superior noted that considering the Virginia Tech shooting had occurred just days earlier, Mateens inquiry about bringing a weapon to class is at best extremely disturbing. View this image  Mike Brown / Reuters FBI agents are questioning people who may have had contact with the gunman behind the deadly Pulse nightclub shooting, including those who attended the same Fort Pierce mosque he frequented before the deadly shooting. On Friday, agents visited the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce where they sat down with a person who previously had contact with Omar Mateen, BuzzFeed News has learned. The interview was one in a series of meetings that have taken place at the request of the FBI, which has been trying to contact anyone who may have interacted with the gunman in the past, Omar Saleh, an attorney with the Council on American-Islamic Relations told BuzzFeed News. Theyve been happening all week and we expect them to come for weeks to come, he said. Saleh would not specifically identify anyone who had been questioned by the FBI, but said some of the people that have sat down with agents in the last few days included people who attended the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce, a mosque frequented by the shooter. Theyre just members who attended the mosque, and they may, or may not have had contact, he said. These are people that agents believe may have had a link, any link (to the gunman). (Agents) are just trying to do their jobs. Agents have contacted people at their homes and work, but Saleh said he has offered the mosque as a neutral location for the interviews to take place. The shooter went to the mosque, so were prepared to sit for interviews with every single member if necessary, he said. We just dont know who in particular they are looking for. CAIR officials are urging members of the community to reach out to the FBI if they have any information about the shooter, Saleh said, but they are also recommending they have an attorney present when speaking with the FBI. View this image  Joe Skipper / Reuters Saleh would not go into specifics over what has been asked or who has been questioned at the mosque in recent days, but he said the inquiries have centered on contact made with the shooter. This is the second time the mosque has made headlines after an attack. The mosque was also attended by Moner Mohammad Abusalha, an American who became a suicide bomber in Syria. Saleh said members of the Muslim community have been worried about possible backlash because of the shooting at the Pulse nightclub, but said leaders of the mosque are welcoming the community at large to attend if they have questions. Nothing that is coming out of (this mosque) is radical, Saleh said. And the way we can prove that 100 percent is that we have an open door. These sermons are not hidden. Everyone is invited. View this image  Flags fly at half-staff around the Washington Monument on Monday. J. David Ake / AP A county commissioner in Alabama is refusing orders by President Obama and the states governor to lower flags to half-staff in honor of the Orlando shooting victims, saying the massacre does not qualify as a valid circumstance for doing so. Baldwin County Commissioner Tucker Dorsey defended his decision to local media and on Facebook, where he cited U.S. Flag code as part of his defense. Once again I have to copy this post regarding lowering the flags because another follower of Islam decided to shoot up a bunch of innocents in a place where they didnt have the chance to defend themselves or flee, Dorsey wrote. When are we going to acknowledge the truth? When will we stop the PC and identify the enemy? View this image  David Goldman / AP Dorsey goes on to point out that the U.S. Flag code does not include a mass shooting or terrorist event as a reason for lowering half-staff. Secondly and principally, our flag code specifies that no other flag shall be above the flag of the United States, and I characterize that as US citizens holding our head up with courage above all others. When the flag is at half-staff, our countrys head is figuratively held low, and quite frankly, I am not willing to hang my head down because of a terrorist attack against our people and our allies. I am not willing to hang my head down because evil shoots up a church, school, or movie theater. We need more than a gesture as a response. I want us, as Americans, to stand tall, courageously, and fight back against the forces of evil, and lets fight like we intend to win. Dorsey also refused orders to lower flags to half-staff after attacks at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Paris, and in San Bernardino. View this image  Wilfredo Lee / AP The FBI is confirming reports that employees of a Florida gun shop talked to agents about the Orlando shooter back in May, a month before the deadly shooting. Employees with Lotus Gunworks, however, did not have any information for FBI agents to follow up on their tip, officials said in statement, including name, date of birth, phone number of e-mail address. The owner of Lotus Gunworks in Jensen Beach has told reporters he notified the FBI after a man resembling Omar Mateen wanted to buy high-end body armor and ammunition. Employees did not have the armor Mateen was seeking, and the owner said he became suspicious when he heard him speak in a foreign language. On Friday, the FBI released a statement confirming they spoke with employees at the gun shop in May on an unrelated investigative matter. Because the store did not carry that particular style of body armor, it referred this unknown individual elsewhere but was unable to collect any information about him, to include name, date of birth, charge card, telephonic information or e-mail address, the FBI read. After the deadly shooting at Pulse, the gun shop again contacted the FBI to tell them the man who wanted to buy the armor looked like Mateen. Unfortunately, given the lack [of] information about this individual, FBI agents were unable to conduct any meaningful investigative follow up. View this image  Patrick T.

View this image  Phelan M. Ebenhack / AP The Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the nations largest LGBT civil rights organization, on Thursday officially endorsed stricter gun control measures as a way to better protect the LGBT community in the wake of the Orlando attack in which 49 people were killed and 53 injured. The organization said easy access to deadly weapons had compounded the threat of bias-motivated violence against LGBT people, and called for restricting access to assault-style rifles, expanding background checks, and limiting the ability of suspected terrorists, and those with a history of domestic abuse, to acquire guns. Forty-nine members of our community were murdered on Sunday morning because of a toxic combination of two things: a deranged, unstable individual who had been conditioned to hate LGBTQ people, and easy access to military-style guns, HRC President Chad Griffin said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. It is imperative that we address both issues in order to mitigate safety risk to our community. 43.

According to school records, Mateens third-grade teacher said he was verbally rude, aggressive, with much talk about sex and violence, obscenities. In the fifth grade, his instructor called him oppositional, and said he lacked remorse. Mateen was charged with battery when he was 14 after getting into a fight with another student at his high school. In a letter first obtained by Today, Mateen explained the incident in 2006 to Florida Department of Corrections as a part of his job application. He called it an experience of me growing up, and I learned a big lesson from it.

Two days ago, Dyers office opened up Camping World Stadium, a massive sports venue in Orlando, to those looking to receive help. So far, 94 families and 256 individuals have visited the stadium. He also offered free airline tickets to people wanting to reunite with their families, and announced 85 compensation claims for medical funeral expenses. One family received help from 27 different agencies for a funeral. Families wishing to bury their loved ones in Orlando have the option of doing so at Greenwood Cemetery, the mayor said. A section of the space has been reserved for the victims. I will only attend a funeral if the family wants me to, he said. These are private ceremonies. Orange County Mental Health and Homeless Issues manager Donna Wyche stressed the importance of self-care when dealing with grief. Pay attention to how youre feeling, she said. Reach out to people you love. Talk to your children about what has happened. Encourage them to understand the world they live in, and that theyre safe. Get away from the television, get away from the radio, because sometimes you need to do that, she added.

aS"I used to compare myself to the models in magazines. Now Instagram is the magazine. Like everyone else, I like beautiful things. We each have a slightly different conception of beauty, especially when it comes to the human body: We might disagree over freckles, a beard or the lack of one, or a stomach somewhat more prominent than average. But while we all have our different preferences, we each have a specific standard of beauty in mind that we would like to achieve. One that is, of course, forever out of our own reach. No one holds their own image as the ideal or at least thats what Id like to believe. Thats why I cant help but immerse myself in the guilty pleasure of admiring the beauty of others. I used to do it casually, flipping through mens fashion magazines, deciding which body Id ask for if a genie appeared in my living room, ready to grant my wish. I was happy to stare at David Gandy posing in a bathing suit; this simple action more than satisfied my needs. But then Instagram came along and sent everything to shit, normalizing my exposure to beauty and transforming a certain kind of hotness that used to feel unusual into something ordinary. Because, fuck, there are a lot of beautiful people in the world. Thats where the trouble starts for someone like me: a gay guy in his thirties starting to feel the pressure that society especially in a social group that puts a lot of stock into appearances has over my self-image. Because suddenly Im the one thats no longer normal. My rolls of fat arent normal because Im not comparing them to the perfectly chiseled stomach of an extremely famous model, but to something a lot closer: the perfectly chiseled stomach of my third-floor neighbor, who I ~casually~ found on Instagram. My neighbor is a normal guy. Hes around my age, has friends, a boyfriend whos also nobody particularly special and a job that pays more or less what Im making. Hes tremendously normal. Worryingly so. However, hes actually reached a level of beauty I can only aspire to, and this, of course, affects me. My neighbors abs spark the question: Could this have something to do with my age? When I was in my early twenties, ready to conquer the world I wasnt yet aware that it was going to conquer me my actual body differed tremendously from the way I pictured it. I looked at my body then the way you look at your partner in the early stages of a relationship as if theyre the most beautiful person youve ever seen. I would have to look at myself in the mirror to realize that no, the perfect skin and toned arms Id been flaunting on the street to the rhythm of the music on my iPhone were actually just in my head. And thats how it was for many years before I ever imagined an Instagram timeline that would filter pictures of guys at the gym, here suffering, showing off bodies that matched the kind Id idealized. In those years, I came out ahead whenever I compared myself with others, because I dealt the cards. My body and I took long walks together eating ice cream. We shared spaghetti dinners, like Lady and the Tramp. We were in love. We took care of everything that we could for each other. Our fights always ended with a hug, and there was always a pat on the back for a job well done. As they say, ignorance is bliss. My new awareness of all the beauty in the world has underlined all my flaws in red marker. Worst of all, in becoming the painfully real, intrusive version of a mens fashion magazine, Instagram has robbed me of the innocent act of staring at David Gandys picture. Its taken away one of the most important things that ritual held for me: aspiration. A while ago not all that long ago, to be honest I wanted to be David Gandy. I wanted everything that being David Gandy implied: I wanted that body, I wanted that face, his checking account, the attention he received. I wanted the complete package, in every sense, of David Gandy-ness. But now, despite his enviable stomach, I dont want to be my neighbor. Why should I? Hes the same as me, flawed. He sings terribly in the shower Im much better. The only thing I envy is his looks. And that realization has revealed that my once-healthy relationship with my body is now more like Peggy and Al Bundy on Married With Children: Weve been together forever, but we hate each other. Unfairly, the arrival of this simple app, along with some life changes that affected how I took care of my body settling down with a serious partner, starting a new job that made me sit 10 hours a day and left little time to exercise, in a new city where I had to take the subway instead of walking and went out for food and drinks more often completely destroyed one of the most important relationships of my life. Now my body and I are jealous of healthier couples (Did you see? The neighbor went to the gym today too, and you havent gotten up from this sofa since 1997). We make false promises, saying everything will return to the way it was before. We feel so much shame. I know youre thinking that I couldve just stopped following these people. That I couldve simply uninstalled the app and lived happily in ignorance. That these people who make me feel bad about my body are looking, in some way, for validation in the form of likes that I wouldve liked to be able to give to myself. That Im a whiner who simply isnt capable of adapting to modern life and that my relationship with my body couldnt have been that good if a photo app could shake its foundations. You wouldnt be wrong. Like when youre sitting on a box of gunpowder, everything is very calm until it isnt. Maybe that Instagram timeline singling out my flaws was simply the spark that made me realize what Id been leaning on. Perhaps the relationship I had with my body, which Id previously considered healthy, never actually was, and Ive simply swung from one extreme to another. Because in reality, it wasnt my timeline singling me out it was me. Ill keep swearing each time that I have to like one of those marble-sculpted Greek gods on the app. And Ill continue to look at my belly and feel a little guilty that Ive paid for a yearlong membership when Ive never even set foot in the gym. But Im going to try to stop blaming others for the fact that I can no longer imagine myself with the arms of steel that Im lacking. Because I dont have them. And that should be perfectly fine.

They want to help the LGBT community achieve equality by fighting homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia. However there are straight people who are heavily involved in the movement but dont use this identification. In the acronym LGBTQIA, A most commonly stands for asexual, but also terms such as aromantic and agender. It is less commonly used for ally, as American Apparel has suggested on its tote bag. Asexual describes someone who is not sexually attracted to anyone. Aromantic describes someone who is not romantically attracted to anyone. Agender describes someone doesnt identify as a man or a woman. allies are appreciated... but a good ally doesn\'t erase members of the community they\'re trying to support. read: https://t.co/plUmbDI4M6 .@americanapparel you have a typo!

aS"Five South American countries are expected to propose creating a new office concerned with LGBTI peoples rights during next weeks meeting of the Human Rights Council. View this image  Elijah Nouvelage / Reuters A group of five South American countries is expected to propose creating a new position at the United Nations devoted to investigating human rights violations against LGBTI people. The position a special rapporteur, or investigator would answer to the United Nations Human Rights Council, which is beginning its next session of work in Geneva next week. We are going to be presenting a resolution, but its a work in progress, said a diplomat with one of the countries sponsoring the initiative, who asked not to be named because the proposal had not been made public. If such a resolution were adopted, it would be a significant step towards ensuring LGBTI rights are an ongoing matter of concern to international human rights bodies. The Human Rights Council adopted its first ever resolution on human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity in 2011 led by South Africa, but it took LGBTI rights supporters several years to figure out how to continue to press the issue further. Thats in part because LGBTI rights blew up into a major global confrontation in 2014, thanks to the showdown over Russias anti-LGBT law in the lead-up to that years Olympics and the reaction of donor nations to sweeping anti-LGBT laws adopted by Nigeria and Uganda. South Africa, whose leadership had been crucial to diffusing allegations that LGBTI rights were a form of cultural imperialism, lost enthusiasm for pushing the cause further at the United Nations. A follow-up resolution introduced that year, sponsored by Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Uruguay, ordered the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to produce a study on LGBTI rights worldwide. The resolutions supporters were bracing for countries led by Russia and members of the Organization for Islamic Cooperation to put up a bitter fight over the study, especially since a resolution devoted to protection of the family passed with language favored by conservatives just a few months earlier. But in the end the studys creation passed by a lopsided 2919 vote. (The report, released in June 2015, included landmark language about partnership and the rights of intersex people.) The sponsors of that 2014 resolution, along with Argentina, form the group known as the LAC5 who are working on the resolution to create the new LGBTI rights position. Diplomats familiar with the proposal say it is possible the position could be called an independent expert instead of a special rapporteur, depending on the outcome of negotiations. Some of the U.N.s current special rapporteurships began as independent expert positions, and the office would have similar powers to report on human rights on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in countries around the world regardless of what its called. Theres no significant difference between the two its really a semantic difference, said a U.S. diplomat who spoke about the pending resolution on the condition of anonymity because the diplomat did not have permission to speak to press. Either way, the diplomat said, it would be a major step forward in making LGBTI rights a permanent issue inside the United Nations. We would have an individual appointed to the U.N. working on LGBT issues and the very act of putting someone into that kind of a position would be very important in institutionalizing it, the U.S. diplomat said.

aS"Fueled by youthful ambition and loneliness, our relationship was more seduction than friendship. View this image  Charlotte Gomez / BuzzFeed S was my first friend in this city. That I made a friend felt like an accomplishment; that I made a friend meant I had conquered the city. S only ever knew me as a New Yorker and a grown-up; this meant, somehow, that I was both of those things. We met at a stupid job I held for seven months, an early internet concern. I was 22 and knew nothing; she was my age but seemed to know everything. S was a sculptor. Thats how you know this is true; if it were a lie, Id have made her a painter, because New York City is lousy with painters, and painters seem romantic/noble/sexy to me. But she was a sculptor, which seems so unlikely, even now, years after the fact; who on earth wants to be a sculptor? With the caveat that memory is always faulty, in my memory, S asked me to join her for lunch one day, so I did. Its unlikely that Id have tendered the invitation. Im shy now and was considerably more so that year, my first out of college, my first in New York. I was often alone as well as often very lonely. We sat in the caf across the street from our office, where the coffee was a dollar and you could smoke inside. I doubt we ate anything. I got two paychecks a month and it took one and half of those to pay my rent. With the logic of 22-year-olds, we considered food an extravagance. With the passion of 22-year-olds, we became best friends. And then, just as quickly, just as inexplicably, we became nothing at all. View this image  S and I were both the children of Asian immigrants who were doctors. Neither of us wanted to be a doctor; other children of Asian immigrants who are doctors will understand that this meant we were a disappointment. Our first common bond. Also, we were, in that preposterous way people in their twenties can be, serious about sculpture, serious about writing. We must have sensed that shared ambition, one that had nothing to do with our office jobs; we teased it out of one another over the course of our conversations, the same way the other secretly gay boys Id known in my youth teased that information out of one another. We were in the grip of our own enthusiasms. She gave me Gyorgy Legeti; I gave her Yoko Ono. She gave me Richard Artschwager; I gave her Lorrie Moore. We did the stuff we said wed moved to New York to do: went to the Asia Society and the MoMA, to a reading or to see modern dance, to find out what was in the Chelsea galleries S hoped might one day represent her. We saw Cremaster 3 and sat through the whole thing. We strolled through the newly opened Hudson River Park until we ran out of park. We went to see the Torqued Spirals and caught a glimpse of Richard Serra himself, chatting with one of the Gagosian underlings. It was like seeing God. Mostly, we sat on the floor of her cold art studio and drank wine out of Dixie cups from the shared bathroom at the end of the hall. We talked oh, how we talked but we listened. My boyfriend was still away at school; my roommate had a life of her own. Before S, on weekends, Id rise early for no reason, and walk into Park Slope because back then you couldnt buy the Sunday New York Times in Fort Greene. Id listen to my Discman and read the Book Review and luxuriate in my loneliness, which was mitigated by knowing Id see S at work on Monday. View this image  I quit that terrible job. We no longer saw one another daily, but S and I would meet for cheap meals or free concerts. I got a better job. Id meet S at her studio bearing food pilfered from the Cond Nast cafeteria. Wed ramble from Midtown to Soho, the cheapest date in town, barely noticing the cold or the blocks ticking by because we were deep in conversation, enchanted by the future we were conjuring. On one of these walks or maybe on a visit to her studio, or maybe at a diner where lunch was $5 S told me, so casually, an aside, like a report on the weather or a mutual acquaintance, that she was having an affair with a married man who was also employed by that odd internet concern. Theyd been involved for months, even while we were all working together. He knew she and I were friends; he had told her he was charmed by me, knowing that she had been charmed by me. I have always been a person who lives more in books than in reality, and the whole thing felt like fiction, a not very interesting short story. This disclosure was disarming not because I had some moral stance on infidelity, but because of the feeling that S knew something I did not. I dont mean the actual secret of their relationship, kept from me even within that small office. I mean something else, some kind of wisdom, some kind of maturity, that eluded me. I felt young and very silly. Months before, I had gone to a concert with S, in a beautiful Manhattan church, and the ensemble was conducted by her lover boyfriend feels like the wrong noun. His wife was one of the musicians. I wondered: What did I know of S, what did Ss lover know of me, what did Ss lovers wife know of S, what does anyone know of anyone? View this image  Later, the world began to implode. It was 2001. I had just quit my better-paying job with no particular plan. There was something frightening in the air. S and I went to see Bjork at Radio City Music Hall and were astonished. There seemed to be so much in the world to be done. Every piece of art we loved was a rebuke. I paid the huge penalty to cash out my 401(k), covered the rent for a few months, and fled New York for an empty house in the woods, not realizing that this would make me feel more insane. I wrote hundreds of pages of a novel that are now stashed away in my closet. S was the only person who came to see me during this sojourn. I cant recall whether I invited her, whether I begged her. I was profoundly alone there; I was without a car and fell asleep at night enumerating emergency scenarios (fire, intruders) and hypothesizing about what Id do. I can imagine asking for her company, but I can also imagine how what I had there my solitude, my silence was something she wanted to see for herself. It was not as thrilling as having a married lover, but it was something. She drove down at the end of December. On New Years Eve, we sat outside, and the ambient sounds of the woods deer treading on dry leaves, the crackle of sticks seemed charming instead of terrifying. Terror and terrorism felt far away. S cut a piece of paper into dozens of little rectangles. We were to write our dreams for the coming year on the slips of paper as many different dreams as we dared imagine. Wed put them away, and a year later, wed look at them, see what had come to pass. I wrote my wishes, first dutifully, then with the fervor of prayer. I used a red pen. Years later, when I moved out of that apartment, I found an empty cigarette box stuffed full of wishes, earnest red scrawl, disappointment after disappointment. It pained me to read them, and I threw the lot into the garbage. View this image  I went back to New York. Things between S and her lover ended; things between me and my boyfriend ended. Her work was in a handful of group shows; a literary magazine published a story of mine, and knowing no one else who might care, I gave her one of the contributors copies with which I was paid. I remember standing in the building vestibule, that self-addressed stamped envelope in my hand, the sliver of paper informing me that someone had liked something I wrote. There was only one person in the world I wanted to share this news with. This was more seduction than friendship. Ours was a sealed, secret thing that had only to do with the two of us, our preposterous ambitions, our youthful pretensions. We itched for something greater and it was as though talking about it could bring it about. We thought we were speaking some weird, private language of our own invention, like twins; we did not know we were simply speaking the language of infatuated kids all over the city, all over the world: the language of dreams, of hopes, of the selves we wanted to become. The last time I saw S was one of those delirious summer days. We walked along the Hudson River and talked. I told her about a guy I had just started dating; I think she told me about a man that shed just started dating, too, but I could be making that up. I did not know that it would be the last time I would see her, so the meeting felt in no way different from our other times spent together. It felt, as those meetings always did, like an assignation: private, passionate. We drank iced coffee and looked across the river, toward New Jersey. Either that day or some day previous we discussed the Pine Barrens. I never saw her again: a couple of unanswered emails, a voicemail message or two, and then an end as mysterious as the beginning had been. I dont know what happened, or why. This was a different time, before technology made it easy to keep tabs on your near and dear, before cell phones were ubiquitous, before we termed this ghosting. Fevered love affairs run their course. The fever broke, and maybe it was impossible for S and I to move forward into real adulthood with all that embarrassing stuff wed said to one another sitting there between us. Maybe S never actually liked me all that well and the whole thing was simply one more of my fictions. Maybe she left me; maybe I left her. When you are young, its deeply annoying to be told that certain things are a condition of your youth. Theres almost always some condescension in the proposition that your reality, your hopes, your frustrations, are just a condition of your age, that what feels unique to you is a very common thing, after all. But I do think that to give yourself over to a friendship with all the fervor of a romance is something thats easier to achieve when youre young. Its not one of youths disadvantages; its one of youths privileges, like being immune from hangover, like being totally cool with eating one meal a day. To forge a profound bond is remarkable; to see that bond shatter is just one of those things. That a friendship ends doesnt mean it was weak from the outset; that it ends says nothing about its importance. A friendship like this is love without the prospect of sex, and perhaps the purer for it. In the end, as is said, its better to have loved and lost. We were but kids. Too old probably for such an adolescent bond, but it happened. We could have been anything, and we both wanted so badly to be something. Now its a decade and a half later and we are both, indeed, what we said we most wanted to be; Im a writer, S is a sculptor. Its Google that tells me this, and Im glad to know it. I married that guy. We had two kids. Im rarely alone, but Im still sometimes quite lonely. I have never found it easy to forge friendships, and most of the friends I hold dear are now scattered. Somehow this was not the adulthood I had imagined, those days of fevered conversation and frustrated dreaming with S, but its mine, and I love it. I didnt know, at 22, that everything that happens to you, the good stuff as well as the less-good stuff, accrues, and becomes your life. I didnt know, at 22, that wishing and doing are different actions. I didnt know, at 22, that regret is useless. If I could go back and change something give myself some big break, pass along some secret information, reassure myself that most things would, in fact, work out I dont think I would. What, then, would S and I have had to talk about? *** Rumaan Alam is the author of the novel Rich and Pretty. His work has appeared in The Awl, The Millions, LitHub, and elsewhere.

aS"Washington state prosecutors ultimately declined to file charges against the actress, who was accused of hitting her then-girlfriend Tasya van Ree at an airport. View this image  Artist Tasya van Ree (L) and Amber Heard in 2011. Charley Gallay / Getty Images Amber Heard, the actress who obtained a restraining order against estranged husband Johnny Depp in May, was arrested in 2009 for allegedly assaulting her then-girlfriend Tasya van Ree in Seattle, court officials confirmed Tuesday. Prosecutors in Washington state ultimately declined to file charges against the actress for the alleged altercation at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, which was reported Tuesday by TMZ. An official with the King County District Court told BuzzFeed News that Heard who at the time had changed her last name to Van Ree appeared for a probable cause hearing on Sept. 15, 2009, adding that the case was filed as an assault. Heard was accused of grabbing and hitting Van Ree in the arm the previous day at the airport, TMZ reported. In a statement to BuzzFeed News on Wednesday, Van Ree defended Heard, saying she was wrongfully accused for the incident. The incident was misinterpreted and over-sensationalized by two individuals in a power position, she added. I recount hints of misogynistic attitudes toward us which later appeared to be homophobic when they found out we were domestic partners and not just friends. Charges were quickly dropped and she was released moments later. Its disheartening that Ambers integrity and story are being questioned yet again. Amber is a brilliant, honest and beautiful woman and I have the utmost respect for her. We shared 5 wonderful years together and remain close to this day. The King County Sheriffs Office and prosecuting attorney did not respond to BuzzFeed News request for comment. View this image  Amber Heard leaves Los Angeles County Superior Court. Richard Vogel / AP Heard was granted a restraining order against Depp on May 27 after claiming physical and verbal abuse. Heard, who filed papers to end their 15-month marriage days earlier, also claims that Depp, 52, is abusing drugs and alcohol, and told a judge the actor has a short fuse that blew on May 21, when he hit in the face with a cell phone and struck her repeatedly. Depps attorney, Laura Wasser, contended in court that Heard was attempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse and to turn the tide of negative publicity surrounding her decision to file for divorce days after the actors mother died. 5.

aS"This delay in sorting out who will pay for PrEP will lead to the death of hundreds of people in Britain. View this image  Jane Ellison House of Commons Public health minister Jane Ellison faced a hostile and protracted grilling by MPs from both sides of the House of Commons on Tuesday over the NHSs refusal last week to fund the drug that prevents HIV, in a regime known as PrEP. During an urgent question posed by shadow public health minister Andrew Gwynne MP on the subject of PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis), no fewer than 15 MPs rounded on the minister variously accusing her, the government and NHS England of having their head in the sand, of passing the buck, and of being incompetent. This, they argued, has led to the worst of all scenarios, which is a legal challenge, which will have disastrous results and warned that the delay will lead to the death of hundreds of people in Britain. The decision by NHS England on the grounds that HIV prevention is the responsibility of local authorities sparked a legal challenge on Friday by the National Aids Trust, which argues that NHS England is duty bound to commission the medication. View this image  Justin Sullivan / Getty Images In an attempt to avoid a costly, lengthy court battle to decide who is responsible, Gwynne demanded that Ellison show some leadership and use Section 7a powers which enable the health secretary to delegate commissioning services to NHS England to force the organisation to reconsider. Other MPs also sought clarification on the legal situation. But Ellison repeatedly refused to be drawn on the NHSs predicament regarding the forthcoming challenge in the courts and instead announced that the government has tasked NICE (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) with undertaking an evidence review of PrEP over the next few months to ascertain not only its cost effectiveness, but also its effectiveness and safety. Several MPs pointed out that the efficacy of the drug has already been proven by both British and international studies, thus NICEs work would be partly pointless. And concerned that such a review would merely stall decision making further, the SNPs Stewart McDonald asked the Speaker if it would be possible to trigger an emergency Commons debate on PrEP to which the Speaker replied it would be a possible approach while condemning the government for having its head in the sand over the issue. UK Gov is giving the terrible impression of having its head in the sand over #PreP. We can't keep falling behind. The furious questioning continued for half an hour as even Conservative MPs expressed their disdain over the NHSs block on the drug. I have lost too many friends over the years to Aids, to not challenge the decision of NHS England not to fund PrEP, said Mike Freer MP, chair of the all-party working group on HIV/Aids. HIV infection rates in this country are on the increase, existing strategies are not working and to suggest we simply do the same going forward is not acceptable. Freer did, however, manage to get the minister to agree to meet with HIV charities on 13 June to discuss the situation. It was more of a direct answer than that afforded to Andrew Gwynne, who asked Ellison, to no avail, whether she would be giving councils more money to pay for this drug, and whether she was concerned by the precedent that would be set were councils forced to start funding medication. Meanwhile, Dr Philippa Whitford MP attacked NHS England as poor to have made the decision on [an] its not our job, its your job [basis]. She added: I think thats the most insulting bit to the community. View this image  House of Commons Labours Ben Bradshaw continued on this theme accusing NHS England of damaging buck passing and suggesting that the continued absence of PrEP is going back to the bad old days where certain groups are being stigmatised which in turn will have a disastrous impact on public health. Again Ellison refused to comment on imminent legal action but stated her personal commitment to tackling stigma. Several more MPs attempted to seek clarification on who was legally responsible for commissioning the drug, but the minister remained mute on the subject. Helen Hayes said it was unworkable for local authorities, rather than the NHS, to fund PrEP; Ben Howlett described the current stalemate situation as the worst of all scenarios and Diana Johnson alluded to the 2012 Health and Social Care Act, which re-structured the NHS and split HIV care between treatment provided by the NHS and prevention provided by councils: Im flabbergasted that shes come before the House today to say that the legislation which her government introduced around the reorganisation of the NHS is so incompetent that NHS England are now having to go to court to work out whos entitled to commissioning these services, said Johnson. The Department of Health admitted to BuzzFeed News that it does not know who is responsible. But even Fiona Mactaggarts intervention, in which she told the minister that the endless delays in implementing PrEP will lead to the death of hundreds of people in Britain did not rouse Ellison who instead pointed to the home testing kits for HIV that the government has brought in.

aS'The Gloucester County School Board is defending its policy restricting students to restrooms reflecting their biological gender. View this image  Win Mcnamee / Getty Images WASHINGTON A case challenging the Obama administrations interpretation of existing civil rights laws as providing protections from discrimination for transgender people will be headed to the Supreme Court this summer. Because the court is soon recessing for the summer, however, the earliest the court could hear the case if it decides to take it up would be sometime late this year or early 2017. The Virginia school board that passed a policy restricting students to restrooms reflecting their biological gender announced in a filing on Tuesday that it will be asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review a case brought against the policy by a transgender student. Gavin Grimm sued the Gloucester County School Board over the policy, backed by lawyers from the ACLU, claiming, among other arguments, that the policy violates Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. The Obama administration has told school districts repeatedly that Title IXs sex discrimination protections include protections against anti-transgender discrimination. At the appeals court level, the Justice Department weighed in on Grimms behalf. In mid-April, a three-judge panel of the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a 2-1 decision that the [Education] Departments interpretation of its own regulation as it relates to restroom access by transgender individuals, is entitled to deference and is to be accorded controlling weight in this case. The 4th Circuit announced in late May that it would not be reviewing its earlier ruling. On Tuesday, lawyers for the school board wrote in a filing at the 4th Circuit, The School Board intends to file a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court within ninety (90) days of this Courts entry of judgment. As such, the lawyers are asking the appeals court to put its ruling on hold while the petition to the Supreme Court is pending. A stay would keep the case on hold and the Gloucester County School Boards policy in place while the Supreme Court decides whether to hear the case. The filing notes that the ACLU opposes the stay request and will be filing a response to the request. After the response is submitted, the 4th Circuit will issue a ruling on the stay request. The court has, in accordance with its rules, issued a temporary stay of the mandate pending a ruling on the stay request. If denied, the school board likely would ask the Supreme Court to grant a stay pending its decision on whether to grant certiorari. [Update, 7 p.m. June 9, 2016: The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 reflective of the initial decision in the case, denied the school boards request for a stay pending the Supreme Courts decision whether to grant certiorari in the case.] Because of the timing of when the filing will be coming in, the earliest the justices will consider whether to hear the case would be in late September in advance of the start of the courts next term and after the start of the next school year. Meanwhile, several other cases addressing similar questions are pending in other federal courts. Five lawsuits relating to North Carolinas HB 2 are pending in various federal courts in the state, and Texas, joined by 10 other states, filed a lawsuit against the Obama administration over its Title IX and other policies interpreting existing civil rights laws as providing protections for transgender people.

aS"Former President Goodluck Jonathan said in a speech in London the law may need to be revised as part of a discussion on how citizens can be treated equally and without discrimination. View this image  Former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan. Pius Utomi Ekpei / AFP / Getty Images The man who signed a sweeping anti-LGBT bill into Nigerian law in 2014 suggested Wednesday the provision could be revisited in the name of promoting equality. Former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, who lost his bid for a second term in April 2015, made the remarks during an event hosted by Bloomberg in London. Technically called the Anti-Same Sex Marriage Act, the bill was signed into law in January 2014. But it also criminalized promoting LGBT rights or even public displays of affection between people of the same sex. The bill provided for punishments of up to 14 years in prison, and its passage was followed by a wave of arrests and violence targeting people alleged to be LGBT. In his Wednesday comments, Goodluck Jonathan noted that the law had been passed unanimously by the National Assembly and enjoyed widespread popular support. But, he said, in the light of deepening debates for all Nigerians and other citizens of the world to be treated equally and without discrimination, and with the clear knowledge that the issue of sexual orientation is still evolving, the nation may, at the appropriate time, revisit the law. Though Jonathan did not talk much about the legislation during his bid for re-election, in the closing days of the race his campaign attempted to discredit his opponent, now-President Muhammadu Buhari, with allegations that Buhari had secretly promised Western nations that he would repeal the Anti-Same Sex Marriage Law. In his remarks, which were cast as a reflection on citizenship and democracy, Jonathan also called for Nigeria to enact a bill of rights to end discrimination and tribalism, and promote equality, enabling everyone to work towards the common goal for the development of the nation. Though Jonathan stopped well short of calling for protections for LGBT rights, it is notable that he referenced the issue as part of remarks about equality. Many world leaders who have supported extreme anti-LGBT legislation have rejected the notion that LGBT people should be protected under international human rights norms and alleged that Western nations are engaging in cultural imperialism by pushing them to do so. A spokesman for President Buhari could not be immediately reached for comment. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The $265,000 campaign in New York City comes after transgender people reported being denied entry to restrooms. View this image  New York City Commission on Human Rights Use the restroom consistent with who you are, say the ads, sponsored by the New York City Commission on Human Rights. They will appear in subway cars, bus shelters, phone booths, newspapers, and more. The ads will also run in ethnic newspapers in Spanish, Korean, Chinese, Russian, and Bengali. In NYC, its the law, the ads say. No questions asked.The campaign, which will cost $265,000, comes after transgender people filed complaints with the city about being barred from restrooms and facing other types of discrimination in places of public accommodation. Seth Hoy, spokesperson for the Commission on Human Rights, told BuzzFeed News in a statement that the agency has investigated such cases in the past and continues to receive and investigate complaints where individuals are harassed or denied entry to restrooms because of their actual or perceived gender identity. That sort of discrimination is illegal in New York City. In December, the commission released enforcement guidance on gender identity protections under the citys 2002 nondiscrimination law, making clear that transgender people are entitled to access restrooms consistent with their gender. Mayor Bill de Blasio followed up in March with an executive order directing agencies to provide access to single-sex facilities without requiring people to show identification or other documents that verify their gender. The ads feature trans New Yorkers, including Alisha King and Charles Solidum. Bathroom discrimination is a regular occurrence for the transgender community, King said in a statement. So much so that many of us avoid even using public restrooms to begin with. I sincerely hope these ads help people understand that transgender people are just people just like you. We just want to use the restroom safely and be treated with respect. View this image  New York City Commission on Human Rights Mayor de Blasio pointed out that New York City is diverging from some other jurisdictions such as North Carolina that have recently moved to restrict trans peoples access to restrooms. While other cities and states are legislating intolerance and taking away individuals right to use bathrooms consistent with their gender identity, we are proudly standing with our transgender and gender nonconforming New Yorkers, the mayor said in a statement. Every New Yorker has the legal right to use the bathroom consistent with their gender identity, no questions asked. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Uber has fired the driver involved. View this image  Lucy Thomas and her partner. Photo: Supplied Lucy Thomas and her partner booked an Uber in the Melbourne suburb of Collingwood after dinner with friends on Saturday night when the incident occurred. Thomas told BuzzFeed News the conversation in the car started out innocent enough until the discussion turned to AFL football. Thomas said the driver began calling the players faggots, before denigrating other people, using words like abo, spastic and retard. After being threatened by our @uber driver, my girlfriend and I stood up to him and recorded it. LISTEN: https://t.co/5IIdpBLSHJ #homophobia  Thomas, who runs Project Rockit, a youth-driven anti-bullying movement, said she has learned in her job how important it is to speak up in situations like this. One of our core messages is about challenging that daily language thats so problematic, she said. So when Im in one of those situations, theres no way I could not stand up and say something. After speaking up, Thomas said the driver turned extremely aggressive towards her partner. Its like a cloud came over him. Hed been aggressive but cheery, but then he was quite attacking toward [Thomas partner]. He was calling her a faggot repeatedly, and was quite aggressive in his tone. View this image  Adam Berry / Getty Images He said to me, you must be a faggot otherwise you wouldnt care. Then he realised we were together, which he hadnt realised because maybe we didnt look the way two women in a relationship are expected to look, Thomas said. By this time the Uber had pulled up outside Thomass home. But with the doors locked, Thomas said she felt extremely threatened, so she pulled out her phone to let the driver know she was recording the conversation. I can do anything I want if Im prepared to suffer the consequences, the driver, who Thomas described as a male in his early 60s, can be heard saying. What are you going to do, give me a one [star] rating? And when I write my report about two people who dont like being called faggots, then what are they gonna say? The driver then unlocked the doors and told the women to get out. When they asked why, the driver threatened to drag them out. Thomas claims the driver sat and watched as they entered their apartment before slowly driving away. View this image  Lucy Thomas and her partner. Photo: Supplied Thomas praised Uber for responding quickly to the incident, but has questioned the companys policy of not providing driver information after an incident like this. Their policy is really messed up and problematic. Its centred on privacy - both the drivers and mine - but thats imbalanced, because the driver already has my address, she said. Thomas said she felt nervous leaving her apartment the next day, in case the driver was nearby. In a statement, Uber told BuzzFeed News the driver had been sacked. Uber does not tolerate any form of discrimination, and we have been in contact with this rider to offer our support. As soon as we were made aware of this incident, we removed the driver from the platform, a company spokesman said. The spokesman said drivers do not have access to client information once a trip has been completed and that Uber will work with Victorian Police to assist them in any investigation.

aS'Norway is the fourth country in Europe to adopt a law that gives transgender people full control over the gender listed on their documents. View this image  Ragnar Singsaas / Getty Images Norways Parliament is expected to give final passage on Monday to a law that will allow individuals to change their gender simply by filing a declaration with a registrar, with no need for surgery or a doctors certification. The legislation won overwhelming backing of lawmakers in a preliminary vote held May 30, advancing with a vote of 79 to 13 to Mondays vote. The bill is historic because it is now the individual and not the health services that decide when he or she has changed legal gender, Health Minister Bent Hie said when the proposal was unveiled in March. Almost every country in Europe allowing legal gender change requires individuals to get a diagnosis of gender identity disorder from a doctor and most require some form of medical intervention. Twenty-four countries require individuals be sterilized in order to have their self-identified gender legally recognized. The European Court of Human Rights called into question sterilization requirements when it ruled it violates international law to mandate sterilization for sex reassignment surgery. The law will make Norway the fourth European country to adopt what is known as a self-declaration gender identity law. The first law of its kind was adopted in Argentina in 2012, and Denmark was the first European country to bring it to Europe in 2014. Malta and Ireland followed in 2015, and a parliamentary committee in the British House of Commons has called for a similar law to be adopted in the United Kingdom. Transgender advocates have been working over the past several years to bring an end to forced sterilization in the country, said Stein Wolff Frydenlund, a Norwegian activist who sits on the steering committee of Transgender Europe. The new law, he told BuzzFeed News, is very good, including paths to legal recognition for children over the age of six and a simple process to notify the registry by mail to obtain gender recognition. These laws are part of a broader push by transgender advocates to bring an end to treating transgender as a mental disorder. Denmark put additional weight behind this effort last month, removing gender identity disorder from a list of mental illnesses their national doctors use for diagnoses. The World Health Organization is currently considering a proposal that would remove gender identity disorder from its list of diagnostic codes used by most countries medical systems. Trans people are not sick, and other countries should follow by removing trans identities from their mental health diagnostic manuals, Transgender Europe Health Officer Adam Smiley said in a statement applauding the decision. CORRECTION The European Court of Human Rights ruled that it violates international law to require sterilization for people seeking sex reassignment surgery. A previous version of this post stated that the ruling concerned legal gender recognition.

aS'Exclusive: Broken Rainbow, which for 14 years helped LGBT people fleeing violent and abusive relationships, has collapsed. Update: The helpline is being taken over by another LGBT anti-violence charity. View this image  Broken Rainbow The UKs only national charity for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender victims of domestic abuse has fallen into liquidation, BuzzFeed News can reveal. The collapse came yesterday 2 June 14 years after Broken Rainbow was formed, and 12 years after it became a registered charity. An insider confirmed the news to BuzzFeed News but at this stage was disinclined to divulge many details. Reasons for the liquidation therefore remain unclear, however, it follows months of speculation about the organisations finances. Just two months ago, staff issued a plea for more funds, claiming that if it did not receive 25,000 within 48 hours it would close. The call led to the Home Office granting the charity another tranche of funding. Another LGBT charity, METRO, is also believed to have stepped in with a donation to help preserve the work of Broken Rainbow. The insider informed BuzzFeed News that the board of trustees has been attempting to find new funders in a bid to secure the jobs of the charitys handful of staff, and to see if there is any way of keeping the helpline open. Rebecca Hendin / BuzzFeed Rebecca Hendin A former service user of Broken Rainbow, Gordon Mundie, told BuzzFeed News: Im really shocked and saddened by this news. Im also deeply concerned that without this charity theres no support for LGBT survivors of domestic abuse. I would hope that a group of people and the Home Office will come together to continue to provide the support that I got when my life was in danger. Mundie spoke of the help he received from the charity. Broken Rainbow was my first point of contact and the first people I told about what was going on. They listened, they offered suggestions, and they supported me by finding an LGBT police liaison officer and made an appointment for me to go and speak to them. He added: They supported me throughout the entire process, from first reporting it to police right through to the day my former partner appeared in court and pled guilty. I will always be incredibly grateful to the team at Broken Rainbow. I now fear for all those still in abusive relationships, who do not feel they can contact mainstream domestic abuse charities. UPDATE Galop, the LGBT anti-violence & abuse charity, says it will be taking over the helpline, and is working with the Home Office to ensure there is no gap in the service. Nik Noone, the charitys chief executive, said: This is a vital service and it is important that those experiencing domestic violence in our communities have somewhere to turn when they need support.

aS"The bill has sat in a committee since fall of 2014. View this image  Tony Dejak / AP The Cleveland City Council could vote as soon as Monday on legislation that would protect transgender peoples right to use restrooms that match their gender identity in restaurants, theaters, and other places of public accommodation, Council President Kevin Kelley told BuzzFeed News. In doing so, Ohios second-largest city could wade into a scorching national debate over transgender rights, risking the same sort of backlash unleashed on cities that passed similar ordinances recently and then had those ordinances repealed by opponents. We are very close, but we need just few things ironed out, said Kelley, who as council president decides which bills advance to a vote. We are trying hard for Monday. The timing would be something of a surprise. The city council introduced the bill in 2013 and has not held a public hearing on it since November 2014. At the time, the bills co-sponsor told BuzzFeed News the bill looked set to pass. Instead, it sat in committee for more than 18 months as conservatives around the United States mounted an effort to mandate that transgender people only use restrooms that match their birth sex. Two recent examples show the challenges Cleveland could face. When the Charlotte City Council passed an LGBT nondiscrimination ordinance in March, Republicans in the North Carolina legislature claimed it would allow transgender women to act as sexual predators in restrooms and nullified it. Likewise, conservatives in Texas making identical claims repealed a nondiscrimination ordinance in Houston last fall. You can never rule that out, said Council President Kelley, acknowledging critics could run a city referendum to try repealing the ordinance at the ballot. But its not a big concern of mine. View this image  Cleveland City Council President Kevin Kelley Via Facebook: KevinKelleyCLE Kelley said council members are building consensus and educating constituents to assuage any fears. He added that after talking to members of the Republican-controlled state legislature, he believes there is not an appetite to override a city ordinance. I think if done correctly, we can avoid that, he said. It may seem that the bill has been a dormant issue to the casual observer, but we have been working to put something forward that everybody is happy with. Jay Brown, communications director of the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT group, said the vote would be particularly welcome ahead of the Republican National Convention there in July. Given the ugly fear-mongering by some lawmakers in places like North Carolina and Texas, this is a notable step forward in a city soon playing host to the RNC, said Brown. With the councils vote, Cleveland will be joining Cincinnati, Columbus and nearly every other major American city in providing critical protections to transgender people. The bill in Cleveland, according to a version posted in 2014, applies to more than restrooms. It would prohibit places of public accommodation including owners, managers, and employees from discriminating on the basis of gender identity or expression in its facilities. Violators would face misdemeanor charges resulting in up to a $1,000 fine and three months in jail. The bill states that places open to the public should allow full access to facilities without qualification to all citizens and employees, including those denied access to bathrooms, showers, locker rooms or dressing facilities consistent with their gender identity or expression. But concerns about the proposal have erupted in the past. To put this through would be opening the door to sexual predators and unwanted kinds of situations that would be very harmful, Hazel Hall, a critic of the bill, told NBC News at a city council hearing in 2014. Kelley said those arguments are fear mongering and a myth. Its unfortunate that has come into the conversation, he added. If council does not vote Monday, he said, it is very likely the council will vote at its following meeting in July. View this image  Terminal Tower and Tower City, left, are shown in Cleveland.

aS"Police in Manchester are launching a pioneering scheme that will track violence among same-sex and trans couples, BuzzFeed News can reveal. Rebecca Hendin / BuzzFeed Getty A British police force will next week become the first in the country to officially and specifically record domestic abuse incidents involving lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender couples. The groundbreaking scheme from Greater Manchester police will mean that whenever an officer attends to a call from an LGBT member of the public alleging such abuse, a special code (D66) will be used in the incident report to denote that the victim is LGBT. Currently, no police force in Britain has a system for recording the sexual orientation or gender identity of complainants, resulting in a complete absence of statistics for LGBT domestic abuse. But this closing code closing codes in all recorded crimes describe the nature of the crime will indicate on the incident log that the abuse occurred in an LGBT relationship. The scheme, which was developed over an 18-month period in conjunction with two LGBT organisations, will initially be implemented in the forces City of Manchester division (which comprises the city centre, along with north and south Manchester) in a six-month trial period. After this and if deemed successful the code could be rolled out across the Greater Manchester area. We have worked long and hard alongside organisations like [LGBT domestic abuse charity] Broken Rainbow and the LGBT Foundation to introduce this code and show the LGBT community that we will continue to tackle domestic abuse, said Detective Chief Superintendent Vanessa Jardine. This is another strong step in the right direction in dispelling some myths and gives people the confidence to report crimes in the knowledge that it will be dealt with appropriately we want to encourage victims and friends and family of victims to report the issue and have the confidence to come forward. Detective Constable Sarah Harris told BuzzFeed News the idea was born out of an attempt, two years ago, to improve the forces response to domestic abuse of all kinds which in turn highlighted key areas that needed work. View this image  Rebecca Hendin / BuzzFeed There were certain groups that were underreporting and we looked at how that could be assisted, she said. One of the things that came up was that we dont have any figures to show how many [LGBT] people report domestic abuse to the police. Until now, only hate crime reports recorded the sexual orientation or gender identity of victims. Although individual officers could note down in an incident report that the couple were LGB or T, Harris said, it was not mandatory and there was no way of compiling all such incidents to provide an overview of the scale of the problem. Of the 6,000 to 7,000 cases of domestic abuse per year in the Manchester area, Harris said that they had no way of knowing without trawling through all those individually how many involved LGBT people. The code has been developed in tandem with rigorous specialised training for all officers who might be attending a domestic abuse situation. In the City of Manchester division, Broken Rainbow have completed five weeks of three-hour training sessions to all our frontline staff, said Harris. That training consisted of detailed understanding of the complexities of domestic abuse within same-sex relationships. Earlier this year, Broken Rainbows chief executive, Jo Harvey Barringer, along with survivors of LGBT domestic abuse, told BuzzFeed News that the nature of abuse within this community can often differ to that of heterosexual relationships, with unique forms of control used by perpetrators, such as threatening to out their partners and withholding HIV medication or, for transgender people, hormone treatment. These forms may or may not feature alongside violence or sexual violence. Harvey Barringer also spoke of how LGBT victims were less likely to access domestic abuse services or report the crimes because it could involve coming out to agencies and officials when the individual might still be in the closet. Both historically and contemporaneously, many abuse survivors have not had good responses from police. One man, Mark (not his real name), told BuzzFeed News of his experience with a force in the South East: They didnt seem to take it seriously. They took the piss. I needed some sympathy, and to know that I was going to get some support, and it just wasnt there. View this image  Rebecca Hendin / BuzzFeed DC Harris conceded that work was needed to increase trust between the LGBT community and the police, and said the training police in Manchester have undergone, along with the implementation of this code, should help. The fact we didnt record it is whats caused the distrust with police in the past, so this will hopefully go some way in showing that if someone does call the police then it will be taken seriously and dealt with effectively, she said. Well be able to show the scale of the problem and work out what we need to do to increase the reporting and increase services, because theres still a lack of services out there for LGBT domestic abuse victims. Both Greater Manchester police and Broken Rainbow hope the code policy will be replicated elsewhere. Emma Baldry, the charitys training coordinator, said: This new code will enable Greater Manchester police to collect data that will give us a more accurate picture of the extent of LGBT domestic abuse in the Greater Manchester area and hopefully other forces across the UK will follow their lead.

View this image  Located at an undisclosed location in the midwest in order to protect the families privacy, Camp You Are You gives transgender kids ages 5-12, who may not be out at school or to their friends yet, a place where they can express themselves freely without judgement. Parents are just as involved at the annual summer event, connecting with other parents to discuss important decisions like whether or not their child should should start hormone treatments. View this image  Documentary director Nicholas Sweeney discovered the camp after coming across a photo series by Photographer Lindsay Morris. She had been documenting camp for some time, and many of the families she had shot with were at a point where they were very keen to share their stories with the intention of helping others, Sweeney told BuzzFeed News. The filmmaker attended the camp from start to finish, interviewing families before, during, and after their camp experience. To me the most important thing was to let them tell their own stories in their own words. Ryan was certain that there was no one like her on the planet she was shocked, Sabrina told BuzzFeed News of her daughters reaction to meeting other trans kids for the very first time. Ryan has been identifying as female since she was three years old. Under Sabrinas guidance the camp has become a week-long event filled with ice breakers, workshops for parents, and pool parties for the entire family. They dont have to explain themselves, they dont have to protect themselves, they dont have to make excuses. There are no questions just have fun! View this image  The camp experience is just as meaningful for parents, who often keep in contact with Sabrina all year long. They have a space to air anxieties without judgement, as well as seek guidance from other parents who can relate first-hand to their questions. According to Ryan, the main event is a fashion show at the end of the week. I saw all of the makeup and the nail polish and dresses the holy grail, basically, Ryan said, referring to the very first time she participated. I was just like, I will use every single one of these. Im going to look pretty! Im going to look the best! But I actually looked like a train wreck because I did all my makeup myself.

Samantha Cooper At a time when the unemployment rate for trans people in the U.S. is double that of the general population, the San Francisco LGBT Centers Trans at Work campaign highlights the talents of working trans and gender-nonconforming people. Launched today with photographs by Samantha Cooper along with a video, a website, and the hashtags #TransAtWork and #HireTrans, the campaign is the brainchild of the SF LGBT Centers Trans Employment Program, the countrys first city-funded employment program specifically for trans and gender-nonconforming people. The Centers director of economic development, Clair Farley a trans woman herself wrote in an email to BuzzFeed News, We hope people can start talking more about the economic impact of discrimination on the transgender community. She believes that the Trans at Work campaign can help combat prejudices against trans people so they can be seen as valued candidates by potential employers.

aS"Gloucester County School Boards only move left is to ask the U.S. Supreme Court if it will review the case. View this image  Dominic Holden/BuzzFeed WASHINGTON A federal appeals court on Tuesday announced that it will not be reconsidering an earlier ruling in favor of the Obama administrations policy that transgender students are protected under an existing civil rights law a move that could send the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. In mid-April, a three-judge panel of the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a 2-1 decision that the [Education] Departments interpretation of its own regulation [interpreting Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972] as it relates to restroom access by transgender individuals, is entitled to deference and is to be accorded controlling weight in this case. The case was brought by a transgender student, Gavin Grimm, against the Gloucester County School Board, which had passed a policy that restricts students to restrooms reflecting their biological gender. Grimm is represented by the ACLU, and the school board is represented by private lawyers. The school board asked the full 4th Circuit en banc to reconsider the case, but the court announced on Tuesday that it had denied the request. The order stated that none of the judges requested a vote on whether to rehear the case en banc and, as such, the request was denied. Judge Paul Niemeyer, who was the dissenting judge on the three-judge panel, wrote an opinion dissenting from the courts decision not to rehear the case. While I could call for a poll of the court in an effort to require counsel to reargue their positions before an en banc court, the momentous nature of the issue deserves an open road to the Supreme Court to seek the Courts controlling construction of Title IX for national application, Niemeyer wrote. The school district must now decide if it is going to ask the Supreme Court to do so and grant review of the 4th Circuits decision. If it does not do so, the case will return to the trial court judge to consider, in light of the appellate courts ruling regarding the administrations interpretation of Title IX, whether to issue the injunction Grimm sought. Grimm, however, said in a statement that he hopes the case will be over now. Now that the Fourth Circuits decision is final, I hope my school board will finally do the right thing and let me go back to using the boys restroom, Grimm said in a statement. Transgender kids should not have to sue their own school boards just for the ability to use the same restrooms as everyone else. The decision also comes just days after Texas and 10 other states sued the Obama administration over its policies and guidance providing for transgender protections under existing civil rights laws. In addition, several lawsuits are pending in federal courts in North Carolina over similar questions, consequences of that states anti-LGBT law passed earlier this year.

aS"After promising to reconsider, NHS England has said again that it will not make PrEP widely available, in a move the National AIDS Trust called astonishing. View this image  Justin Sullivan / Getty Images NHS England has reaffirmed that it will not roll out the drug treatment, known as PrEP, that stops people contracting HIV leaving the NHS open to legal action from one of Britains leading HIV charities. Following a meeting of NHS Englands specialised services commissioning committee, a statement was posted on its website that concluded that it accepted NHS Englands external legal advice that it does not have the legal power to commission PrEP but said it remains committed to working with other commissioners to explore the possible provision of PrEP. Instead, it will only give the drug to a few hundred men in test sites. The announcement immediately sparked a furious reaction from the National AIDS Trust (NAT), which said it was considering legal action. In a statement the charity said: NHS England has confirmed its decision to remove PrEP from the official NHS commissioning process, leaving this potentially life-changing drug on the shelf and inaccessible to people at real risk of HIV. The decision by NHS England not even to consider commissioning PrEP came after 18 months of hard work from an NHS working group (comprising clinicians and experts from across the HIV sector) which demonstrated the need, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of PrEP. View this image  Facebook The NATs chief executive, Deborah Gold, added: NHS England is sitting on something that could be the beginning of the end for the HIV epidemic if only it were made available. The refusal to commission it for all those at significant risk is astonishing. Seventeen people are being diagnosed with HIV every day. We are extremely disappointed and we will now be looking at our options, including further legal action. The NHS England announcement follows months of controversy surrounding funding for PrEP. In March, to the shock of the HIV sector, NHS England announced it would not roll out PrEP to those at greatest risk of contracting the virus as the drug falls under HIV prevention, which they argued was not part of their remit but that of local authorities. Following an outcry from both HIV groups, clinicians, and activists, and after the NAT sent NHS England a legal letter challenging its decision, the body agreed to reconsider, prompting renewed hope the drug would be made available. That hope, and the commissioning process that could have led to the drug being given to those most likely to become HIV-positive, are now in tatters. An NHS England spokesperson told BuzzFeed News: We have listened carefully to stakeholders, and will continue to work with Public Health England and other partners on reducing HIV transmissions, but our external legal advice is clear that NHS England does not have the legal power to commission PrEP.

aS"Parents are born in so many ways. View this image  My wife and I wanted a baby for so long. We wanted this baby to somehow have both of our bloodlines, but didnt think it was possible until I called my brother, Danny. His words were Sis, why would I not give you this gift? You helped raise me, I turned out well. Youre an amazing godmother to my child and want you to have this gift too. Noah, our son, is thriving. He just had his nine-month checkup, took his first steps, and can say four words already. He claps and throws balls and is just a happy baby. What seemed like an impossible dream is my reality. Each day I am grateful and thankful for the gift my brother gave us. My son. I could never give him something as amazing, but a lifetime of gratitude. Mal Vasquez, Facebook View this image  Id always promised myself Id be a dad by the time I was 40. By 41 I realized Id been a self-indulgent gay and that I wasnt just going to wake up pregnant. I pursued adoption first and completed the certification process but I still felt that biological tug. I asked a single lesbian friend if shed be interested in donating eggs. She agreed and I started the hunt for a gestational surrogate. After interviewing a bunch and some false starts, I found one who embraced the process: a military wife who was born in Iraq but now lived in San Diego with her husband and two kids. During the IVF process, my egg friend decided shed like to be more involved. It wasnt unexpected as Id left the door open to co-parenting, which is like what a divorced couple does except ours was by design. Oh, and during the process, my friend started dating another woman and they got married after same-sex marriage became legal. Now 10 months later, Dominik has no clue about the convoluted backstory to how he got here. He just knows that hes surrounded by tons of love and, yes, a bunch of gays who are gaga for him. Michael Bellavia, via email View this image  We started our family with the standard lesbian starter kit: legal marriage, anonymous sperm, and a gender neutralnamed baby surrounded by handmade wooden toys. We ended our family with the same kit: amicable divorce, co-parenting with minimal drama, and 50-50 custody. I knew Id be a parent, but I didnt know it would be like this. I didnt know that by being queer, Id get to opt out of so many of the parenting expectations set up by straight people. Ive never been very good at the expectations set by straight people. As a nonbinary trans divorced parent, my kid and I get to figure it out as we go. Shes all princess and gender theory, so Ill let her lead. Well be just fine. Casey Brown, via email View this image  My husband and I started our adoption journey around the same time as our 10th anniversary, just as we were planning to get married. Our adoption social worker kept telling us that there was no way we would have a baby by the time we got married, and that we should plan our wedding, have a great time, and let the process work itself out. Of course, our daughter was born and placed with us right before the wedding, so our guest of honor was a beautiful 5-week-old. It made the day more special. mattm41c4aaf31 View this image  I just happened to fall in love with the most amazing girl in the world. She had given birth to two beautiful little girls while in a previous relationship, which turned out to be a huge bonus for me! My life was completely changed when I became their mama. They dont know life without me and we make our blended family work. Crazy in love! Megan Neal, via Facebook View this image  Having kids was discussed early on in our relationship like, EARLY early. But our careers were in full swing, so we focused on work and on us. As we got older and more financially secure, we moved farther out of the city, bought a home, adopted a dog you know the drill. And since we hadnt screwed up any of those things too badly, we finally felt ready to take the plunge into parenthood. Wed always known we were going to adopt, but didnt know from where. International adoptions had gotten increasingly complicated, so we worked with a local agency for a while, then settled on one in Portland, Oregon that had worked with a lot of same-sex couples. Fast-forward (it was actually painfully slow) two and a half years after home studies, social worker interviews, multiple trips to the doctor, and even our first attempt falling through and we were finally matched with our birth mom. She had chosen us for many reasons, the most special of which was that she liked that we called each other husbands. At the time, same-sex marriage still wasnt legal in our state. Our son was born a month early, so we rushed as fast as one can rush cross country and were there late that evening of the day he was born. The hospital had set up a room for just the three of us Daddy, Papa, and Jon and it was the most intimate, harrowing, and wonderfully fulfilling thing Id ever experienced. Holding my little boy for the first time wasindescribably precious. Brent Almond, via email View this image  This is what our path looked like: Surgeries and meds, meds, and more meds, but we have a beautiful 3-month-old baby boy now! We were lucky enough to get pregnant on the first try with reciprocal in vitro fertilization. This means I carried my wifes baby. He was born three months premature and has had a very tough road in the NICU (today marks 100 days), but hopefully we will be home soon. Getting pregnant was tough and his prematurity was tough but we wouldnt have it any other way. He is such a precious boy! Jules Otarres, via Facebook View this image  My partner is a transgender male and we have been together for nine years. Last year we decided to try to have a baby. After many professionals told us that we shouldnt bother trying due to the endometrial ablation he had at 16, he decided to go off the testosterone so we could try to conceive our own child. We are now at 17 weeks on into our pregnancy. We have some great doctors here caring for us, and the enthusiasm they have for a transgender person to give birth is really extraordinary! Hopefully, on or around Oct. 22, we will be proud parents of our first child! Cory Hovland, Facebook View this image  We never thought wed be able to have children since Florida always had a ban on gay adoption. So, with years of preparation and many professionals/surrogate/donor/fertility teams/legal teams, etc. involved, we had our first child, Nate, via surrogate in California. Tony Fortier as told to Brent Almond View this image  My partner and I blended our families, as we both had children from previous marriages. Her daughter is 15, my two girls are 5 and 9, and last November we welcomed our beautiful baby daughter into our blended brood. She was conceived at home with donor sperm donated by a friend of ours (contracts were signed and exchanged) and all six of us are happy, healthy and love our crazy little crew. Sy Taylor, Facebook View this image  My partner is MTF trans, and before she started taking feminizing hormones we decided to bank sperm while also trying to have a baby the good old-fashioned way. We conceived in the last possible weeks before her new hormones really kicked in (and destroyed her fertility) and Im now almost three months pregnant. Were aware of the challenges that we might face, but were OK with it because we love each other and we know were going to be the best parents we can be to our future child. kgknitsstuff View this image  We had our son in 2014 by means of a sperm donor and turkey baster. It sounds funny and I didnt think it would work but it did. Our donor is a close friend of ours who is still in our sons life as his uncle. Contracts were signed before we conceived, and he has already agreed to be our donor for our next child. Chelsie Riehle Stephens View this image  We became foster parents, and after parenting many newborns through fostering, we decided we wanted to conceive a child of our own. We are expecting our first child this November. We conceived via intrauterine insemination. Fertility treatments are not for the faint of heart and I couldnt have gotten through them without my wife by my side, and injecting my side nightly! Nicole Ashley, Facebook View this image  Seven years into our relationship, with a deployment to Iraq under our belts and one year of legal marriage, we decided it was time to grow our little family a little bit more. On Halloween of 2013 we found out we were pregnant on our second try of IUI. It seemed too easy and we were ecstatic for a summer baby. A little over a week before our due date we went in for our last checkup. We happily hurried because for the first time ever I had overslept. We still arrived on time for our appointment and just like any other I gave my sample, checked my weight and blood pressure and all was on track. The doctor came in and began to use the mobile handheld ultrasound device to listen to his little heart just like the week before. But there was no longer a heartbeat. We hurried to the exam room and used the real deal ultrasound and there was our beautiful baby boy, Liam. Still, peaceful, and gone. Hed left us through the night with no known cause of death. We broke. We knew wed never be the same. Were not. We still carry a scar on our hearts and well always remember him. In February 2015 we were pregnant again, this time we were due on Halloween thanks to IUI and our last donor sample. Perhaps a sign from our little Liam that hed watch over our his little sibling. Oct. 5, 2015 we met our youngest son, Rowan. Beautiful, healthy, happy, and with a set of lungs that could clear a room. A little boy who was his own but favored his older brother. Our hearts could beat again with a love who was untouchable. Little Liam and Rowan made us mommies and we are so thankful to have them both touch our lives. Heather Lawson Gauvey, via Facebook View this image  Weve got two girls from previous relationships, and as single moms neither of us thought we would ever co-habitate with a partner again, let alone a partner with a child. And yet here we are! Kite Town, Facebook View this image  My wife and I both knew that we wanted to start our family with adoption. As former teachers we shared a passion for young people and witnessed the impacts of children in foster care. After our first year of marriage we became licensed foster parents and received our son seven months later. He was six days old when we picked him up from the hospital. This past week we actually signed the official adoption petition and will finally be able to share our last name with our son. Our social worker contacted us after we signed the petition and said Im so in love with you both! Our first purpose in life is to give love, to be loved, and to create more opportunities of love and thats you.

aS'This could be a critical turning point in the fight against HIV it must not pass us by. View this image  Justin Sullivan / Getty Images In a rare, almost unprecedented move, the entire HIV sector has come together to call on the NHS to provide the drug called Truvada that stops people contracting the virus. In a letter to The Times newspaper, every major HIV organisation, along with leading clinicians and prominent activists, have demanded that NHS England seizes the opportunity to radically reduce the number of new infections by making the treatment, called PrEP, available to those most likely to contract HIV. The government must now make PrEP available to people at high risk in England, the letter says. Every day this is delayed, at least seven people will be infected with HIV. The intervention comes just three days before a critical turning point in the fight for the drug which is already available in France, Canada, Kenya, Israel and the USA and what could be a pivotal moment in the history of the virus. On Tuesday, a meeting of NHS Englands Specialised Services Committee will take place to decide whether PrEP (which stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis) is NHS Englands responsibility and if the organisation can fund it. It follows a dramatic few months in the course of funding decisions, which began in March when, to the surprise and horror of the HIV sector, NHS England announced that it would not roll out PrEP to all those in need, but instead provide it for just a few hundred men in test sites, claiming it was not the organisations responsibility. However, an NHS England document unearthed by BuzzFeed News a few days later contradicted the claim, and the Department of Health admitted to BuzzFeed News that it did not know who was responsible. But last month, after a considerable outcry and a lengthy legal letter from the National Aids Trust reminding NHS England of its duties, the body backed down and promised to rethink its decision. If on Tuesday the committee gives the go ahead, PrEP will be recommended to the final decision-making stage in a few weeks at the Clinical Priorities Advisory Group. The full text of the letter in The Times reads: View this image  The Times A drug now exists that prevents HIV: pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). When taken correctly, it is nearly 100 per cent effective. But NHS England is standing in the way of utilising this remarkable breakthrough. After 18 months of delays, David Cameron has now committed NHS England to giving an answer on PrEP imminently. As the decision looms, arguments against PrEP are running out of steam. Men accessing the drug in trials have not shown an increase in sexually transmitted infections. The NHS spends 50 times more on HIV treatment than prevention. PrEP, alongside condom use, has enormous potential to reduce HIV transmission. It is available in the US, France and Kenya. The government must now make PrEP available to people at high risk in England. Every day this is delayed, at least seven people will be infected with HIV. NHS England will decide on Tuesday if PrEP should be considered for funding. This could be a critical turning point in the fight against HIV it must not pass us by. The letter is signed by, among others, the Terence Higgins Trust, the National Aids Trust, the British HIV Association, GMFA, Positively UK, and the European Aids Treatment Group, as well as some of Britains most eminent HIV doctors, including Professor Sheena McCormack, who conducted the groundbreaking trial into PrEP. "This could be a critical turning point in the fight against #HIV - it must not pass us by." #PrEP @thetimes If NHS Englands meeting on Tuesday concludes that PrEP should not be made widely available, the organisation could face a battle in the courts. We will still be watching and willing to instigate legal action at a later date if we arent successful in their reconsideration in May, Deborah Gold, chief executive of the National Aids Trust, told BuzzFeed News last month.

Some networks and cable channels are straightforward about the fact that television is a brutal marketplace, and of course most shows will not find enough of an audience to stay on the air; others wont confirm that a show thats yanked after five episodes is a goner. From an audience perspective, there are satisfying ways for a show to come to an end (NBCs Parenthood is a recent example) and terrible, enraging ones: After their abrupt cancellations this month, ABCs Castle and Nashville both left fans howling. (Castle stapled on a happy ending that The Hollywood Reporter called a wreck; Nashville opted for a cliffhanger in the hope, according to Deadline, that the show will find another home which will be a huge fuck-you to its fans if it doesnt.) After its fourth season, the executive producers of CBSs Person of Interest Jonathan Nolan, who created it, and Greg Plageman, one of its showrunners were given an unstated message that their show was on its way to cancellation. After that realization, they decided Person of Interest would go out with dignity. You look at this season with shows, longstanding shows, like Castle, Nolan said in an interview with BuzzFeed News this week. All of a sudden, its like, Oh, we couldnt figure it out, youre done. We absolutely did not want that to be the case here. For its first three seasons, the most shocking thing about the complicated drama was how popular it was. The series follows a group of vigilantes led by Harold Finch, a damaged, brilliant billionaire (the brains), and John Reese, a damaged ex-CIA assassin (the muscle). Finch (Michael Emerson) and Reese (Jim Caviezel) and the rest of their gang help people in trouble, and that has provided Person of Interests weekly procedural engine. But the larger backdrop that has evolved on the show is that one AI called The Machine and another AI called Samaritan are in a good-versus-evil battle in which the stakes arepretty much the world as we know it. View this image  Emerson, Caviezel, and Amy Acker (center) as Root. CBS Person of Interest was a hit right away for CBS. Then, in its second season, the show did something rare these days: It grew around 16 million people were watching weekly. After it moved starting in Season 3 from Thursdays at 9 to Tuesdays at 10, a much tougher time slot because of cable and DVR competition, Person of Interest still brought in around 14 million viewers each week. Throughout its fourth season, viewership dropped off, but thats par for the course: It still drew a crowd. Which is why its a true curiosity that Person of Interest has ended up here: with CBS burning off its fifth and last season. It premiered on May 3, and at a pace of two episodes a week the series finale will air on June 21. The trouble, as far as Nolan and Plageman see it, became acutely evident last May during the upfronts, when the networks present their new shows and schedules for the upcoming season to advertisers. No one at CBS had told them ahead of time that not only would Person of Interest be left off of the networks fall schedule, but its episode order would be cut from the usual 22 to 13. In fact, the two executive producers laughed at a question that presumed they had been given a heads-up about either development, both of which are signs of imminent cancellation. It was pretty surprising, said Plageman. We had felt at the time that we would be getting a full order going into the season. They learned that Person of Interest had been ghosted off the schedule only after CBS unveiled its fall programming to press before its upfront presentation. And then, Plageman said, You go through the usual gamut of emotions. After these unforeseen blows, Nolan said the shows creative team decided to move forward with their own plan. No one was clear with us that this was a final season; we kind of decided that this was a final season. You read the tea leaves here, and it was clear that with a reduced order its not likely that we were coming back, he said. So we decided: Fuck it. Were going to tell the end of this story, in such a way that doesnt slam the door shut on the universe of the show that wouldnt be a fitting end to the show anyway. But telling a final season in such a way that it would leave everyone satisfied with the story that we told. And that was our decision. This is a gift. In a statement to BuzzFeed News regarding Person of Interest, CBS spokesperson Chris Ender wrote: Its never easy to say good-bye to a good show, but were proud of what all of us network, studio, actors and producers have accomplished over a great run of five seasons and 103 episodes. View this image  Acker and Sarah Shahi, right, as Shaw. CBS Person of Interest is both a relic of a rapidly dying business model for broadcast television, and a harbinger. Its producer, Warner Bros., the once indomitable studio that developed and oversaw Friends and ER, is in a difficult position these days. It still owns The Big Bang Theory, and plenty of other shows. But without a major network corporate sibling where it can funnel its productions Universal Television has NBC, 20th Century Fox has Fox, ABC Studios has ABC, and CBS Studios has CBS Warner Bros. ends up at a disadvantage in a case like Person of Interest. (Warner Bros. does co-own The CW with CBS, but its a smaller network that caters to a younger audience than the other four broadcasters.) As CBSs chairman, president, and CEO Leslie Moonves told The Hollywood Reporter recently, the company broke even on Person of Interest last year, but because Warner Bros., not CBS, profits from the shows back end (DVD sales, foreign rights, streaming, syndication), it was literally not worth it to renew the show. The Machine might shake its head knowingly about such capitalist concerns dictating art. The Person of Interest producers, however, were not naive to these obstructions. This is how the world works, said Nolan. But that doesnt mean they have to like it. If the business is just going to be more vertically integrated, where the networks only buy their own product, thats not very good competition, Plageman said. Even when Person of Interest was a massive hit, they felt the negative effects of these corporate tensions. For its first two seasons, the show didnt stream anywhere: not on Hulu, not on Netflix after the season ended and not even on CBS.com. We literally existed in primetime, Nolan said. If you didnt see the show or didnt DVR the show, you werent going to see the show. And the only way to catch up on the show was by way of DVDs. After the second season, CBS.com began streaming episodes; after Season 4, Person of Interest finally became available on Netflix. But considering viewer behavior at this current moment, it was a recipe that created an eroding, aging audience. And so, after the fourth season, CBS decided to try a new show in the fall in Person of Interests former time period: the now-canceled Limitless. The signals all pointed one way. Yet no matter how much Nolan, Plageman, and fellow showrunner Denise Th had their own plan to execute ending Person of Interest how they wanted it to end the limbo was painful. Sarah Shahi, one of the shows leads, was cast in another CBS pilot, Nancy Drew (which did not get picked up), and they were asked to strike the shows sets. View this image  Emerson and Shahi. CBS When asked about those instances, Nolan said, Id rather not get into those specifics if possible. Look, no one ever wants to have the difficult conversation, right? And I get that. Later, he added: No one wanted to pick up the phone and say, Youre canceled, because, frankly, thats not quite how it works. Theres a lot of moving pieces when the network is looking at whats in front of them. Theyve got a slate of shows coming out, they dont know if the new stuff is going to work. You just become a question mark for them. Plageman said that their concerns about the uncertainties surrounding Person of Interests fate were mostly for the actors and the crew, who want to know whether they have a level of job security. With actors, its a much more difficult scenario, and theyre being kept in the dark and told a number of different things, Plageman said. Its even worse when youre on set, and theres a game of telephone, and people start to speculate. He added: They have these huge long contracts, and they have to figure out whether theyre going to be able to go and read for another pilot, or are they going to be held for the duration until the show is done airing, all the way through the spring. It precluded a number of our actors from going out. As a writer and a producer, you can do a couple of things at once, said Nolan, who has simultaneously been working on HBOs forthcoming and by all accounts difficult Westworld for several years. For our actors who moved to New York, who shoot 14 hours a day for 200-plus days in a row, this is their life. We tried as best as possible to communicate with them and let them know what was happening. CBS executives said publicly for months that Person of Interests renewal chances were still being discussed, even though the show didnt appear on the networks 2016 midseason or early spring schedule. In March, when Season 5s May premiere date was announced and the press release that accompanied the announcement still didnt say that this would be the shows last season enough was enough for Nolan and Plageman. When the airdate was finally announced, we announced that this was the final season. That was something that came from Greg and myself, Nolan said. They issued a statement to IGNs Eric Goldman, thanking the network, studio, cast, crew, and fans. We cant wait for you to experience this thrilling and final chapter, the statement read. Without ever having had a straightforward conversation with CBS about the c-word, as Plageman put it, how were they absolutely sure the show was over? Without getting into specifics of the way the storytelling works, when we submitted certain final episodes and they did not draw a note, that was when we knew that we had taken the right course of action, Nolan said. View this image  Kevin Chapman as Lionel Fusco. CBS But just because the writers decided to take matters into their own hands didnt mean they ran amok. CBS had always wanted the show to keep its case-of-the-week spine rather than chucking it and making it a pure mythology show. Going into Season 5, there was a conversation about the amount of stand-alone versus serialized storytelling that, somewhat to my surprise, remained something of importance to them, Nolan said. And to the degree that there are compromises in this final season, its in that area. I wish wed had a few more episodes to continue telling the bigger story. But Im very, very proud of what we did. Considering the bumpy road they have traveled, Nolan and Plageman sound mostly at peace with how things unfolded. We endeavored to make an entertaining but thought-provoking show about artificial intelligence, incorporating the creeping surveillance state, said Plageman. And I still believe the show to be prescient and absorbing. The ratings for these final episodes have been, understandably, much lower than the shows median. But Person of Interests viewership is still stronger than that of some first-run network shows benefiting from much more promotion. We went off the air for almost a year and returned to ratings that are comparable to where we were at last year, Nolan said. Thats a testament to me to how amazing our fans were through the years, and thats why you do it. Dumping a whole bunch of episodes of a show on the air just to be rid of them used to be a canceled seriess final indignity. But maybe even that has changed in 2016. Its tricky they would qualify this as a burnoff, whats happening here, said Nolan with a laugh. But one mans burnoff is another mans binge! Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The Terence Higgins Trust has criticised the decision to give a vaccine that helps prevent genital warts, penile cancer, and anal cancer to only a small group of men. Moodboard / Getty Images Getty The government has announced it will make the vaccine for the human papilloma virus (HPV) which can cause cancers and genital warts available to men on the NHS but only for a select sample, prompting a furious response from Britains biggest HIV charity. Currently, all schoolgirls aged 11-14 are already given the vaccine to prevent HPV from triggering cervical cancer in women, but neither boys nor men are offered the jab to stop penile and anal cancers. Health minister Jane Ellison pledged on Thursday to offer the injection from June in a pilot study in England and Wales but failed to promise a full rollout across the male population. Through this pilot, the HPV vaccine will be offered during existing appointments at selected GUM [sexual health] and HIV clinics in England to test delivery in these settings, she said. Public Health England is in the process of agreeing which GUM and HIV clinics will take part in the pilot. A full rollout of a HPV vaccination programme for men who have sex with men will be dependent on the progress and outcome of the pilot. But Dr Shaun Griffin from the Terrence Higgins Trust said: The announcement of this pilot feels like a cynical stalling tactic, and said the measure was small-scale and unnecessary. The evidence is already there, he said. More test sites will only delay implementation of a full national programme where all men who have sex with men are given this life-saving vaccine which could prevent them from getting cancer. Such a large-scale move is vital, he said, but to be most effective, the HPV vaccine must be made available widely to all boys before they are sexually active. View this image  BuzzFeed News Unlike many vaccines, the HPV jab can be effective even after an individual is infected, by flooding the body with the antiviral treatment. In November 2015, the group that advises the British government on vaccination recommended all men up the age of 45 be given the injection. The intervention, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, prompted widespread expectation among sexual health doctors that they would be able to vaccinate all men deemed at risk of the virus. Any man who has had any form of sexual or genital contact with another man, even once, is at risk of contracting the virus. And last year a group of prominent doctors accused the government of homophobic discrimination for not offering the jab to all gay and bisexual men. Every year in Britain, 2,000 men are diagnosed with cancers caused by the virus, including anal, penile, throat, tongue, tonsil, and mouth cancer. TV doctor and sexual health advocate Christian Jessen told BuzzFeed News in 2015 it was negligent and nonsensical not to give men and boys the vaccine. Dr Rosemary Leonard MBE said not to do so was sexual discrimination against men. And Dr Max Pemberton, Daily Mail medical columnist and editor of Spectator Health magazine, told BuzzFeed News: The government is letting gay and bisexual men die of cancer.

aS"The videos were reinstated after BuzzFeed News approached the site for comment. View this image  recon.com YouTube has reinstated a fetish websites promotional videos after allegations they were being removed because they featured gay men, while comparable videos featuring heterosexuals were being left online. Recon is a popular gay fetish community website with over 40,000 members. It offers networking, videos, and an online store for those interested in, among other things, bondage, bikers, fisting, hoods and masks, leather and a fetish seen on a widely watched TV documentary pups. Its YouTube channel, which was suspended this month despite having existed for several years, has recently passed 1 million views. It contains footage from all aspects of the brand behind the scenes from photo shoots, interviews with members of the fetish community, and promotional videos for fetish gear from the websites online store. A day after BuzzFeed News approached YouTube to ask why the videos were being taken down while comparable heterosexual ones were still live on the site, Recons account was reinstated. YouTube told Recon in an email earlier this month that it had suspended the account due to its three strikes rule, which meant it had previously removed three of its videos in six months. YouTube had begun to take action against the site in March, placing age restrictions on the content and then removing it. YouTube wrote: YouTube isnt the place for sexually provocative content. In addition to this, violent, graphic, or humiliating fetishes arent allowed on YouTube, and videos containing this type of content will be removed. However, a spokesperson for Recon told BuzzFeed News they felt the content only bordered provocative due to the fetish nature of the videos, and was by no means full-on or explicit. An example of one of the previously banned videos is below: youtube.com  The companys spokesperson pointed out that there are hundreds, probably thousands of videos on YouTube of women being sexually provocative in latex with thousands of views. A brief search of the site appears to confirm this is the case. Recons spokesperson added: It seems unfair and a bit strange that some of these videos have been up for years but only now been highlighted as problematic. It feels as those were being targeted or penalised because our content is about gay fetish. BuzzFeed News contacted YouTube, and a spokesperson for the site said: With the massive volume of videos on our site, sometimes we make the wrong call. When its brought to our attention that a video or channel has been removed mistakenly, we act quickly to reinstate it. We have an appeals process in place for users, and when its brought to our attention that a video has been removed mistakenly, we act quickly to reinstate it. A day later, Recons account had been reinstated. In an email from YouTube, the company was told: After further review, weve determined that while your video does not violate our Community Guidelines, it may not be appropriate for a general audience. We have therefore age-restricted your video. This does not negatively impact your account standing. A spokesperson for Recon told BuzzFeed News: Were thrilled to have our channel back! We would love to work with YouTube to figure out what their community guidelines mean for brands/individuals who create and broadcast material a little bit outside of the norm. They went on: However we are disappointed that our total channel views in excess of 1 million have been removed. This obviously puts restrictions on our content being more widely seen by the YouTube community. A lot of time and effort was put into building our presence as it can be difficult to reach the likeminded people who most connect with what we do. We know that YouTube understands the wide variety of human interests and tastes, and were hopeful that theyll return our channel views so that we can continue to engage with our members and fans around the world.

aS"Defendants include the Education, Justice, and Labor departments, as well as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. View this image  AP / Pablo Martinez Monsivais Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and officials in 10 other states on Wednesday filed a lawsuit in federal court resisting the Obama administrations policies advancing transgender rights, including the recent guidance that instructs schools to let transgender students use bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity. Among the defendants in the lawsuit are the Education, Justice, and Labor departments, as well as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Defendants have conspired to turn workplaces and educational settings acrossthe country into laboratories for a massive social experiment, flouting the democratic process, and running roughshod over commonsense policies protecting children and basic privacy rights, says the complaint filed in U.S. district court in Northern Texas. The suit argues that the Obama administration has overreached by interpreting civil rights laws that ban discrimination on the basis of sex to also cover transgender people. Defendants rewriting of Title VII and Title IX is wholly incompatible with Congressional text, the states say. In response, Justice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson said in a statement to BuzzFeed News that while the Department will review the complaint, the federal government has strong legal foundations to uphold the civil rights of transgender Americans. In addition to Texas, the plaintiffs include Alabama, the Arizona Department of Education, Georgia, Louisiana, Maine Gov. Paul LePage, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Also named are the Harrold Independent School District in Texas and the Haber-Overgaard Unified School District in Arizona. Conservatives have coalesced in recent months around opposing transgender nondiscrimination policies, both locally and nationally, arguing the rules create safety risks for women and girls in bathrooms. However, there are no documented examples of transgender nondiscrimination policies facilitating or legalizing nefarious activity in bathrooms in the United States despite being implemented in many cities, states, and federally regulated venues. The guidance issued to public schools on May 13 instructs publicly funded education institutions to allow transgender students use facilities consistent with their gender identity in a wide range of settings, such as restrooms, dorms, and sports venues. The move was the latest of many from the Obama administration advancing the view that sex discrimination bans in existing civil rights laws include a ban on anti-transgender discrimination. For several years, the Obama administration has asserted that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Education Act of 1972 which ban discrimination on the basis of sex ban gender identity discrimination, or anti-transgender discrimination, as a form of sex discrimination. In 2012, the EEOC began the moves with a ruling in a complaint brought by Mia Macy against the federal government. She alleged the she was denied a job based on anti-transgender discrimination and asserted the Title VII bars such discrimination. The EEOC agreed, citing a growing number of court decisions reaching the same conclusion and prior Supreme Court decisions barring sex-stereotyping, allowing her complaint to proceed. In 2013, officials in the Education and Justice departments announced a settlement agreement that resolved a complaint filed on behalf of a transgender student who faced discrimination a California school district. The next year, federal officials issued guidance under Title IX that protects students on the basis of gender identity in cases of sexual violence and the Justice Department announced it was backing the EEOCs view of Title VII. Since then, the agencies have advanced the Title IX interpretation by pushing several school districts into compliance. In courts again citing Title IX federal attorneys filed an amicus brief before the 4th Circuit Court in October backing a transgender boy trying to overturn a Virginia county school districts policy. The court found in April that the department could apply Title IX that way. The most recent guidance states that a school must not treat a transgender student differently from the way it treats other students of the same gender identity. The Departments interpretation is consistent with courts and other agencies interpretations of Federal laws prohibiting sex discrimination. But the states argue that the bans on sex discrimination in civil rights laws were never intended to cover gender identity when Congress passed them decades ago. Further, they argue, enforcing the federal governments more recent interpretations of those laws to protect transgender people violates the Administrative Procedure Act and they attempt to abrogate the states sovereign immunity. The states are asking the court to declare that the transgender protections exceed federal authority and to block federal officials from enforcing them. View this embed  3.

aS"Queensland is *finally* moving to equalise the age of consent. View this image  Justin Sullivan / Getty Images Health minister Cameron Dick told the parliament on Wednesday that the government would legislate to make 16 the age of consent across all lawful sexual activity. Currently, the age of consent for anal sex in Queensland is 18, and 16 for all other sexual acts. The announcement comes after an expert panel found the inconsistent age of consent had adverse consequences for young people, and made it harder to access information on safe sex. View this image  Samuel Kubani / AFP / Getty Images One of the fundamental tenets of our society is equality before the law, Dick said. As health minister, I find it unacceptable that some Queenslanders are banned from discussing safe, consensual sexual activity with health professionals its archaic and its dangerous. In all other Australian states, the age of consent is equal for all lawful sexual acts. It is 16 in NSW, Western Australian, Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, and 17 in South Australia and Tasmania. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The violent modeling fantasia of The Neon Demon, the lurid lesbian love story of The Handmaiden, and the rape-revenge character study of Elle are deftly made, headily stylish, and cracklingly clever. Nevertheless, they require a but View this image  Elle Fanning in The Neon Demon. Broad Green Pictures The Neon Demon opens with a gorgeous, disturbing shot of Elle Fanning posing like a high-fashion murder mannequin, selling sex and violence as if the two have interchangeable appeal her face covered in gem decals and her body in blood as shes sprawled over a chaise like shes just had her throat slit. The Handmaiden is a lesbian romance whose main characters control the narrative except when they have sumptuously filmed intercourse, at which point the perspective retreats to the ideal distance from which to leer as they 69. And Elle starts with its heroine getting raped, and then becomes a revenge story of sorts, but not before the victim forms a relationship with her attacker that should launch a million fiery think pieces. Behold the problematic faves of this years Cannes Film Festival movies that are deftly made, headily stylish, and cracklingly clever, and that nevertheless require a but But its about a character who sleeps with her rapist. But its incredibly male-gaze-y. But its populated with women who literally devour each other while trying to be the fairest one of all. Cannes has been home to plenty of controversial and outrageous movies. Just last year, Gaspar No offered formalwear-clad audiences unsimulated sex and an ejaculation right at the camera, all in 3D. But The Neon Demon, The Handmaiden, and Elle arent controversial, not in bomb-throwing ways that aim to make people walk out of the theater. Their asterisks are as worth exploring as all the things they do well. View this image  The Neon Demon. Broad Green Take The Neon Demon, the latest from Drives Nicolas Winding Refn, a director who wears his many fetishes on his sleeve, and whos consumed with highly stylized, electro-scored fables about anguished men. This new one is actually about a woman, or rather a teenage girl named Jesse (Fanning), who was orphaned at 16 and has newly arrived in a dreamlike L.A., with aims of making it big in modeling. She has drifted into a dark industry comedy by way of Dario Argento, a syrupy world where identically long-legged women strut in lingerie for higher-ups who evaluate them with the cool eyes of a gambler considering horseflesh, and where women are also regularly criticized or fired in front of rooms full of people just business, you know. But Jesse is different as she strolls into agency representation, a shoot with famous photographers, and a gig with an established designer. Everyone looks at Jesse with a hunger thats not quite lust, as if yearning to suck the dewy youth, the newness out of her bones. The Neon Demon is a toxic fairy tale, but Refn is too in love with its toxicity for anything as prosaic as a critique. Everyone in it has been warped, like cutthroat models Sarah (Abbey Lee) and Gigi (Bella Heathcote), whove internalized the brisk cruelty of the industry rather than built up defenses against it, interested only in attacking rivals rather than uniting against the people treating them as discardable. The movie is a bloody-mawed catfight on hallucinogens, but the visual splendor doesnt change the fact that the film barely has characters. Instead, it has shadow figures in the dark, like Jena Malones motherly-predatory makeup artist Ruby, or Desmond Harringtons aloof-predatory photog Jack, or Keanu Reeves, whos much fun as the sleazy-predatory owner of the motel in which Jesse stays. Jesse herself is an enigma, green but aware of and ever more confident in her own power. Refn creates a seductively surreal version of hyper-competitive showbiz, but he cant get inside his heroines head and find the emotional core that his teary men always have, no matter how heightened their environments. Its not the sexualized violence or the woman-on-woman viciousness thats the films weakness its the distance. View this image  Kim Min-hee and Kim Tae-ri in The Handmaiden. Amazon Studios The Handmaiden has no trouble getting inside its main characters heads. The film, directed by Oldboy provocateur Park Chan-wook, spends most of its runtime there, with Sook-hee (Kim Tae Ri) and Hideko (Kim Min-hee) narrating large sections from their own distinctively prickly points of view. Sook-hee is a thief masquerading as a meek ladys maid in order to help a con man in his scheme to marry a rich noblewoman. That noblewoman would be Hideko, who looks like a porcelain doll but whos harboring some very dark depths. Most of the movie is set in the labyrinthine of the half-British, half-Japanese mansion in which Hideko lives with her uncle, observing as desire builds between the two women, simmering over baths and scenes of one dressing the other. The Handmaiden is based on Sarah Waters 2002 novel Fingersmith, with the action transposed from Victorian England to Japan-occupied Korea in the 1930s. Fans of the book will likely find the film maddening in how it whips between being guided by its characters growing attachment and gawking at it. Its not the sex itself, its the way its filmed, like its an act the characters are performing for the camera rather than each other one late explicit scene is the most hilariously gratuitous part of a largely unnecessary coda. But The Handmaiden is sexy and twisty and so compelling despite this, lodging itself in the points of view of two women who are constantly underestimated by the men around them, and who learn to take advantage of how theyre misjudged. With intrigue that includes the staged reading of erotica, you could argue that Sook-hee and Hideko end up reclaiming acts originally described for the enjoyment of men for themselves if the enjoyment of men didnt seem so important in how theyre portrayed. View this image  Isabelle Huppert in Elle. Sony Pictures Classics The heroine of Elle, however, has no patience whatsoever for those whod underestimate her. Her name is Michelle (played by the ferocious Isabelle Huppert) and she is the witheringly, fabulously unsentimental CEO of a video game company. Elle which is directed by returnee from Hollywood Paul Verhoeven (of Total Recall, Showgirls and, more recently, Black Book) is essentially a startlingly enjoyable character study with an extraordinarily difficult starting point. It opens with Michelle getting raped by a man in a ski mask who broke into her house, and who leaves her, bleeding, on the floor. Rather than call the cops, with whom she has a bad history, she cleans herself up, orders delivery, has her doofus son over for dinner, all the while turning the experience over in her mind, indulging in fantasies in which she beats her attackers head in with an ashtray. The assault isnt dismissed or made light of, despite Michelles cool customer display. Rather, its how Elle introduces itself as a film about what happens when you dont have the reactions people consider to be normal, an aspect of Michelles life since she was a child. She isnt dead inside or unaffected, she simply has no interest in fitting herself to others expectations of appropriate behavior something thats also true in regard to her sons disastrous relationship, her elderly mothers disastrous relationship, as well as the programmers at her company who loathe and fear her. Unsure of how to tell those closest to her about what happened, she shruggingly informs them over dinner, and the way their shocked silence is interrupted by the waiter popping champagne is the kind of dark joke Elle specializes in. The dearth of fucks Michelle has to give about the feelings of others is a sort of superpower, and Hupperts desert-worthy aridness and impeccable timing make this character one of her most enjoyable roles. Elle stumbles, but doesnt quite fumble the ball, when Michelle figures out the identity of her attacker, and makes some decisions that arent unconventional so much as opaque. Theres a difference between psychological complexity and having your otherwise smart cookie of a main character do things that put herself in danger, and Elle wades into territory in which the two get muddied. The Neon Demon, The Handmaiden, and Elle are, after all, movies from button-pushing directors whose aims arent always precise, even if their filmmaking is superbly on point. And I had the most fun arguing over Elle at this years festival, an event that sometimes felt like it uses its art-for-arts-sake standing as a shield against such conversations. Movies dont exist in a vacuum, even at Cannes, but discussing their flaws also shouldnt mean theyre dismissed. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .

aS"A lot of the money Ive raised has been LGBT money. View this image  AP / John Locher A major fundraiser for Hillary Clinton told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday that her campaigns refusal to fill out a survey on transgender rights is a tactical error that may expose the presidential candidate to blowback from the left. Bernie Sanderss campaign has been able to fill out the survey, so I dont understand why Hillarys campaign wouldnt be able to, said Lane Hudson, an LGBT activist in Washington, D.C., who has netted more than $100,000 for Clinton and is listed on her campaigns website as a Hillblazer. He warned that the campaigns silence could make Clinton vulnerable to arguments that she is not really for trans people, despite her strong LGBT track record. View this image  John Locher / AP I dont want to give these people reason to criticize her at all, said Hudson, who is a member of Clintons National Finance Committee. I think its a mistake for the campaign to ignore this. He pointed out that a lot of the money Ive raised has been LGBT money. BuzzFeed News reported Monday that Clinton did not fill out an 11-page questionnaire from Trans United Fund, which asked candidates about issues that ranged from healthcare access and changing gender markers on IDs, to using civil rights laws to protect transgender people. Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump also did not fill out the survey. However, Clintons rival, Bernie Sanders, affirmed his commitment to the groups agenda with detailed responses. In addition to criticizing Clinton for not filling out the questionnaire, Sanders supporters pointed out on social media that he backed marriage equality before she did. Surprise,Clinton didnt care about gay rights until she needed to and is now ignoring transgender rights https://t.co/ScIvcTo8bV #FeelTheBern I figured something fell through the cracks, said Hudson, who contacted the Clinton campaign after reading the article. He reached Dominic Lowell, the campaigns LGBT liaison, who had told Trans United Fund in an April email that we look forward to responding to the survey. But Hudson said that after reaching him, The LGBT liaison told me they would not be responding to the survey at all, which he found troubling after the campaign had agreed to participate. I have spoken to a few other National Finance Committee members and they also did not understand why the campaign staff was refusing to respond, said Hudson. A political action committee, Trans United Fund launched last month in response to a growing effort by conservatives to block and repeal transgender rights, distinguishing itself from other transgender advocacy groups by focusing on election-year politics. Its disappointing to me that Hillarys campaign is in effect ignoring and refusing to work with the only transgender political organization that exists in their inaugural year of existence, particularly because Hillary has a strong record on trans issues and a strong platform, Hudson said. To be certain, the Clinton campaign has repeatedly advocated for LGBT rights including transgender rights in part by releasing a detailed LGBT policy paper last year and focusing outreach efforts on LGBT voters. The Clinton campaign did not immediately reply to BuzzFeed News questions about Hudsons concerns or why it did not respond to the survey. Im pretty sure that if Hillary knew what was going on, she would not be happy with the decision thats been made, Hudson said. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The premiers heartfelt speech is an Australian first. View this image  Lukas Coch / AAPIMAGE Speaking to the Victorian parliament on Tuesday, premier Daniel Andrews apologised to people convicted of historical homosexual sex offences no longer considered crimes. Up until 1981, gay men were convicted of offences such as buggery, loitering for homosexual purposes, gross indecency, and offensive behaviour. There was a time in our history when we turned thousands of ordinary young men into criminals. It was profoundly and unimaginably wrong, Andrews told the parliament. The premier said in no uncertain terms that the government had to take responsibility for the laws it had enacted in the past. It is the first responsibility of a government to keep people safe, he said. But the government didnt keep LGBTI people safe. The government invalidated their humanity and cast them into a nightmare. And those who live today are the survivors of nothing less, nothing less than a campaign of destruction, led by the might of this state. Andrews took the opportunity to send a message to all LGBTI Victorians, saying you have a government and a parliament that is on your side. He also said that he believes the apology is a world first. To our knowledge, no jurisdiction in the world has ever offered a full and formal apology for laws like these, he said. Six men have so far successfully expunged their records under a Victorian scheme that began 1 September. View this image  Justin Sullivan / Getty Images In 1977, Tom Anderson, then 14, was sexually abused by a male employer. But after reporting the incident to police, he was charged with two counts of gross indecency and one count of buggery. After almost 40 years I am glad to be able to attempt to finally put to rest this event in my life, he said. This event has caused me untold anguish, anxiety, stress, and trauma throughout my life and the formal state apology goes a long way to hopefully easing that in my future. It has been a long and at times very painful and traumatic campaign leading up to this apology and only time will tell the true effect and closure it will bring me. Anna Brown, director of advocacy at the Human Rights Law Centre, said the apology would recognise the harm caused by these convictions and highlight that sex between consenting adults should never have been a crime. This apology is a powerful symbolic act that helps to repair the harm caused by these unjust laws and affirm the value of gay, lesbian, and bisexual peoples sexuality, she said. View this image  Anna Mendoza / BuzzFeed Victoria, NSW, and the ACT have all introduced schemes to expunge historical homosexual sex offences, while governments in Tasmania and Queensland have committed to such schemes but are yet to legislate them. Tasmania has also committed to a formal state apology, similar to the one offered by Andrews today. In South Australia, a 2013 amendment allowed people convicted of historical sex offences to apply to have their convictions spent but not expunged. This is also the case in Western Australia, where it is illegal to discriminate against a person on the basis of a spent conviction. The Northern Territory has not given any indication of introducing expungement legislation. When a conviction is expunged, it is erased in the eyes of the law. The conviction no longer shows up on a police records check, people are not required to disclose it for any reason, and they cannot be denied a job because of it. A conviction being spent is a slightly different process, which only allows the criminal record to be amended after a time period of not offending in SA and WA, 10 years. There are also certain exemptions where a spent conviction must be disclosed, which is not the case for an expunged conviction. What should happen is that states should legislate so victims can apply to be restored to the position they were in before the conviction, she said. There are a number of accompanying measures: Being able to say on oath you were never convicted, having the records deleted, or at least annotated to say its been expunged, [and] ensuring its an offence for people to disclose information revealing the persons conviction.

aS"Trump also did not respond to a Trans United Fund questionnaire sent to presidential candidates. View this image  AP / Seth Wenig Bernie Sanders declared he was an ally to the transgender community and he vowed to expand transgender protections under existing federal civil rights laws if hes elected according to his answers to a presidential questionnaire sent in April by a transgender-rights advocacy group. More than a month after receiving the same questions, however, Hillary Clinton hasnt provided answers to the Trans United Funds survey even though her campaign initially indicated she would respond. I think Sanderss answers were thoughtful and strong, said Hayden Mora, chair of Trans United Funds organizing committee, which was formed this year as a response to a growing effort by conservatives to block and repeal transgender rights. In contrast, Mora said the groups leaders feel disappointed and perplexed by Clintons silence. She has been a champion on these issues, said Mora. But Im disappointed. The trans community is in tremendous crisis, not just due to issues of violence and HIV, but also because there is a national coordinated political attack by extremists now more than ever. Mora said Sanders responded to the 11 pages of questions within 10 days, expressing support for a wide range of proposals, from facilitating health care services by federal agencies to banning discrimination by federal contractors overseas. Too often, it seems as if the T in LGBT is silent, Sanders wrote. In my administration, the T will not be silent. Sanders said that he supports using civil rights laws to advance transgender nondiscrimination policies until Congress formally adds those protections to our laws. In the past month, the Obama administrations Justice Department used an evolving interpretation of civil rights laws to bring a lawsuit against North Carolina, challenging an anti-transgender statute, and it issued guidance with the Education Department on ways to accommodate transgender students. The last three weeks have shown the power and importance of the federal government in protecting the barest minimums of basic rights for trans folks, Mora said. Its powerful that the Sanders campaign took the time to complete the survey and are unabashed in their support. The Clinton campaign which had issued a detailed LGBT policy paper last year initially indicated it would answer the groups questionnaire in an April 11 email that Trans United Fund shared with BuzzFeed News. The Secretary has been a leader on many trans issues, and we look forward to responding, a staffer on the campaign wrote in the email. But one month later, more emails between the parties show, the campaign had not returned the questionnaire or responded to a request to summarize Clintons positions. Sanders has not always fleshed out his position on transgender rights, either. In April, Sanders said he would do everything I can to overturn anti-LGBT laws in North Carolina and Mississippi. However, he did not answer questions from BuzzFeed News at the time about how he might do that. Providing slightly more detail, Clinton said at the time she would challenge those state laws through legal action in the courts, pursuing federal legislation, or using the bully pulpit to address actions in the states. The presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump, and his campaign also did not respond to Trans United Funds questionnaire. Clintons and Trumps campaigns did not immediately reply to BuzzFeed News questions Monday about why they did not respond. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

The womens attorney, David Seitz, said they decided to accept the deal in an early settlement conference. He added that he thought it was unlikely for anything unexpected to happen with the City Council meeting, since it would be in the citys interest to go forward with the settlement. This is a good resolution at a good time for everyone, Seitz told BuzzFeed News about the settlement. Via Courtney Wilson Via Courtney Wilson Courtney Wilson, 25, and Taylor Guerrero, 21, who were vacationing in Hawaii from Los Angeles, claimed that Officer Bobby Harrison harassed and arrested them on March 3 for public displays of affection in a Foodland store on Oahu. The suit filed in October said Harrison saw the women walking through the aisles holding hands, hugging, and kissing, and in a loud voice, ordered plaintiffs to stop and take it somewhere else. We were just being goofy, Wilson said to BuzzFeed News when describing the couples affection. The women continued to shop, but when Harrison saw them later still being affectionate he threatened to throw them out of the store. While the women were in the check-out line, Harrison approached the couple a third time. Wilson attempted to call 911, while the officer grabbed her arm. Guerrero tried to intervene and the officer shoved her. The officer then threw Wilson to the ground and said she was under arrest for assaulting an officer. The two women were arrested and charged with felony assault of an officer, but the charges were dismissed five months later.

The allegations were not sustained, a Honolulu Police Spokesperson said to the Associated Press about the investigation into the officers conduct. Harrison retired at the end of last year, the spokesperson said. We are glad that it is over, but are very disappointed that Harris suffered no direct consequence, Wilson said to BuzzFeed News after the settlement was decided. We are glad this case got so much attention because in the end it showed people to stand up for your rights because you can. Wilson added that the couple is no longer together. She returned to Los Angeles after the charges were dropped, while Guerrero decided to live in Hawaii. 7.

aS"The San Diego Gay Mens Chorus were supposed to sing the national anthem on Saturday night, but the crowd heard a recording of a womans voice instead. Facebook: video.php The San Diego Gay Mens Chorus have accused their hometown baseball team of homophobia after the choirs attempt to sing the national anthem at Saturdays game was drowned out by a recording of a woman and they were then taunted by sports fans. Some 100 members of the Gay Mens Chorus had been invited to perform The Star Spangled Banner to open the Out at the Park event at San Diegos Petco stadium, where the Padres and the Los Angeles Dodgers were due to play. After taking to the field, however, the men stood silently as a recording of a woman singing the anthem blared on speakers throughout the stadium. The voice was believed to be that of Fridays anthem singer, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. No attempt was made to stop the recording and start over, the Gay Mens Chorus wrote on Facebook on Sunday. No announcement of apology was made to the singers or their friends and families in the stands. No attempt to correct the situation occurred other than to force the 100 men to stand in the spotlight of center field for the songs duration and then be escorted off the field to the heckles of baseball fans shouting homophobic taunts including, You sing like a girl. View this image  San Diego Gay Men's Chorus / Via Twitter: @sdgaymenschorus In a short statement issued on Saturday night, the Padres said a mistake was made in the Petco Park control room that prevented the San Diego Gay Mens Chorus from performing the National Anthem as scheduled. We apologize to anyone in the ballpark who this may have offended, and have reached out to the Chorus to express our deep regret for the error, the team said. However, the choir said they were very disappointed with the dismissively brief two-sentence statementwhich did not appropriately address the gravity of the situation, nor pay due to the 100 volunteers who took to the field in celebration and were led off in humiliation. The choir said the teams president and CEO had made contact to apologize and offer to meet with LGBT leaders. The singers also demanded the citys attorneys office and human relations commission independently investigate the incident to see if Padres members engaged in activity in violation of the San Diego Human Rights Ordinance or engaged in any deliberate hate crimes based on sexual orientation. What should have been a night of joy and celebration at Petco Park last night instead turned into a nightmare raising serious questions about homophobia within the San Diego Padres organization and its relationship with the LGBT community, the chorus said.

aS"I was always told whenever I lost my job: What on earth would the customers think? View this image  SWNS.com / rossparry.co.uk Over the years, I reckon in lost salary, seniority, and pension interruptions I have lost at least 250,000, just for being trans. This is Jenny-Anne Bishop. Her life straddles seven decades, from the days before medical transition was possible to an era of supposed legal protection for transgender people. Her experiences in employment of sackings and bullying might almost be expected 20 years ago. But they are not what life is supposed to be like for trans people in Britain today. This is because, six years ago, something extraordinary happened. Finally, after generations of discrimination, of being fired, mocked by colleagues, or rejected at interview, trans people saw a new law introduced in Britain that promised to change life for them at work: the Equality Act 2010. It not only stated that a persons gender identity was protected at work, and could not be used to bar anyone from employment building on previous legislation but also demanded that employers protect their workers from harassment, and create a culture of equal opportunities. There were exceptions: Some employers, such as womens refuges, could argue that what they offered was sufficiently gender-specific as to justify barring trans people. But the legislation prompted great optimism that perhaps trans people would no longer be driven out of jobs or left resorting to desperate measures to make money. And in further cause for optimism, earlier this year, new guidelines from the women and equalities committee recommended to parliament that even these exceptions should be overturned. But the reality for some is very different from what the law says. A recent survey of 435 trans people found 60% reported experiencing discrimination at work. And when BuzzFeed News approached trans people of all ages to talk about their experiences, both before and after the Equality Act was passed, a troubling picture emerged highlighting the complexities trans people can face in the job market and what more needs to be done to deliver true equality in the workplace. View this image  Jenny-Anne Bishop SWNS Jenny-Anne Bishops career in the oil and gas industry spanned 40 years shes now 70 back to when she knew she was a woman but was still presenting as male. Id been out in the [trans] community from the early 70s, she says, but every time work found out I was trans in my private life it wasnt long before I was fired or made redundant. And four decades later, some companies were no better, she says; they were simply more covert about their discrimination. Even after the gender reassignment regulations were added, particularly in the private sector, there was always a way found to get rid of you, she says. I lost my job twice again in the noughties. For Bishop, the cause of such discrimination is simple. It really is fear of the unknown, she says. Its prejudice. I was always told whenever I lost my job: What on earth would the customers think? Despite a CV that includes senior-level experience at director level, Bishop says her career has been marred by setbacks frequently because of transphobic attitudes. Time and again, she says, she lost out on promotions and the salary that goes with them because of who she is and the introduction of anti-discriminatory legislation did not sufficiently change the attitudes of employers. On one occasion a new employee was hired to look after the extra business she had generated. He turned out to be transphobic, says Bishop, and the ensuing tension between her and him became the excuse to force me into retiring sooner than planned. With the law now on her side, she felt she could have taken action against what was happening. But, says Bishop, I just felt too weary to fight it any more. Her partner offered to support her until her pension payments began, and so rather than battle any more, Bishop instead retired. Now living in Rhyl, North Wales, she volunteers with the local trans community and numerous LGBT groups, assisting with the rehabilitation of trans young offenders, raising awareness in businesses, and providing equalities training to the North Wales police. Its more rewarding, she says, but doesnt stop her looking back on her career with regrets. Im sad as I think my talent was lost so often in jobs I really enjoyed doing, she says. But the moment anyone found out you were trans you suddenly became this worthless person. View this image  Helen Dale SWNS Bishops story is not uncommon. Helen Dale, 68, recently retired from her IT project manager role at the National Probation Service, where she was chair of the LGBT staff association. This, combined with her experiences as a campaigner for trans rights, has meant Dale has encountered countless others who have been penalised after transitioning. I know of managing directors at engineering companies who now work as telephone operators, she says. I can cite examples of former managing directors of their own companies being ousted, or their businesses failing as a result of their transition. Or sales staff being pulled off the front line because it might embarrass the customers. And qualified psychiatric nurses ending up in cleaning jobs. Lots of cases of discrimination and harassment at work leading to resignations. Dale, who lives in Salford, started to transition while working at a computer workshop in the late 90s. Originally on a rolling contract, she was labelled the best worker in the workshop by her manager and promised a permanent position. In the middle of the year I was told, Youre going to be taken on permanently, she says. But one of the other engineers said to me that if I was to transition then it would make it very difficult for the rest of the guys in the workshop. He was a good friend of one of the managers and a week or so later I was told that my contract was not being extended after all. She adds, sarcastically, Of course that had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the fact I was transsexual or that I was going to transition. Dale lost her job. But others have found themselves locked out of employment entirely, with employers nervous about trans employees in public-facing roles. You get organisations that think theyre going to lose customers if they have trans people on the front line, so they dont take the risk, says Dale. When I started my own transition in the late 90s Id met something like 300 individuals who had transitioned or were in the process of doing so. Of those only nine had successfully held on to their jobs during that process. View this image  Helen Dale SWNS But, she adds, experiences vary enormously, with some people not directly discriminated against, but alienated by their environment following transition. Youve got those [trans women] who started work in macho jobs to prove they were men and they no longer feel comfortable in those environments. Or those who dont feel comfortable in themselves and in meeting other people [at work] who have then resigned from their jobs because its too much to cope with. All in all, she says, I would think that very, very few people who transition achieve what they could have done, had transitioning not been necessary. When Reena Gibson, 46, originally came out as trans in 1994 she was told by her employers, a family-run engineering company, that coming to work dressed as a woman would put her job at risk. Though she heeded the threat and continued presenting as a man, they still made her life hell. After closely monitoring the time she arrived at work, her employers eventually made good on their promise and fired her for breach of contract. It took just three months to tally up enough incidents of lateness to provide legal grounds to sack her (she says the countless extra hours shed worked werent factored in). After a judge ruled against Gibson at a tribunal, she was forced to move on. Despite applying for jobs she was more than qualified for, her honesty about her trans status proved too much for interviewers. One in particular involved doing the same job but in a packaging company, she says. I attended the interview in guy mode, but when asked for the reasons why I left my last job I said, If I tell you the truth youll never offer me the job. They asked me to just tell them anyway. Needless to say, I was never invited back there again. Eventually she was offered work of sorts. Two part-time jobs. One of the employers told me at the interview that they dont have an issue with me as long as it doesnt get passed on to the customers. Her negative experiences convinced Gibson to de-transition, so she spent the next 15 years presenting as a man. She eventually came out again in 2012, the same year she was made redundant from her role as a school supervisor. Though the redundancy wasnt related to her gender identity, things have not been easy since then. Finding jobs as a guy was very easy over those 15 years, but since my redundancy in 2012 Ive struggled to find work again, she says. I went for an interview for a simple driving job on minimum wage and Ive been turned down for that too, most probably due to my trans status since I also have a clean driving licence. Ive applied for jobs where Ive declared it [being trans] and heard nothing back, and where I havent declared it Ive got emails and phone calls. Gibsons experiences have left her terrified of rejection. I have a huge fear of not being accepted at interview, probably due to the amount of knock-backs I had when I came out the first time, she says. I think this is the reason why Id rather declare it on the application forms than just turn up for the interview and they see for themselves: Im not one of those that easily passes. There are, she adds, many trans people who pass really well and work in stealth mode, too afraid to reveal their history. Employers, she says, are so focused on the bottom line that they forget a simple principle: If you do not encourage or even allow trans employees, you may be missing out on the best person for the job. Businesses are run to stay in business and be profitable, and I feel a lot of employers are unwilling to take the risk with many of us, Gibson says. If I had just come out of prison there would be help out there to get me back into work, but for people like us theres not a lot out there. Im still waiting for that drive for trans people, where [employers] say, Look, we havent got enough trans people working for our organisation, lets jump on that bandwagon. View this image  Tanner Lewis Gibbins-Klein SWNS Trans men can be equally affected, but in different ways, especially for young guys emerging on to the job market today. Tanner Lewis Gibbins-Klein is 21, lives in Bradford, and is pretty proud and open about being trans, he says. However, he doesnt want his gender identity to impede his career and feels he has to make careful calculations about what to say on job applications. I do a lot of LGBT and trans community work. So Ive automatically outed myself just by putting my experience down on a CV, he says. But if I left stuff out I wouldnt have much recent experience. And beyond having little choice but to be open about his gender identity when applying for jobs, at the point of work being offered, there are further considerations. My passport still has an F in it so I know that any job I apply for, if they ask for proof of ID Im at some point going to have to show them and out myself. I cant even use my [previous] boss as a reference because he never knew me with my name as I am now and I cant bring myself to out myself to him just in order to ask him to act as a referee. Once in employment, further issues arise, whether or not he is out. View this image  Tanner Lewis Gibbins-Klein SWNS Ive got a job this summer working with 16- to 18-year-olds. I am going to be doing quite physical activities in the first week and I havent had top surgery [to remove breasts] yet, so I bind. The idea of constantly looking over my shoulder and making sure Im not going to be doing anything thats going to out myself or compromise the trust that the young people have in meits just unnecessary hassle. Transitioning is not a swift process, and other trans men BuzzFeed News spoke to said the misconception that it requires one single surgical procedure is still far too common. With a trans man it can be up to four operations, so obviously thats time off, says Felix Fenlon, 49, whos from Hull and is currently working as a teaching assistant. Theres the chest surgery, which could be two operations, depending on how large you are or your recovery times. Then of course you have the complications that could happen when you have phalloplasty [to create a penis] as theres a very high risk of infection in that area of the body. View this image  Felix Fenlon SWNS People who transition during employment should be protected by law. The Equality Act 2010 states that employers should not treat those undergoing a transition any less favourably than they would someone who is sick or injured. But legal protections do little to curb the pressure that trans people experience as a result of taking time off. Just because youve had the training [about employment discrimination] doesnt mean youre still not going to discriminate, says Fenlon. But from an employers point of view I understand: Its a lot of time off we have, especially the men. But most of us will try and accommodate that by having it in our holiday time. He adds: Since 2010 I havent had any actual holidays. Ive gone back to work in the actual recovery period and Ive been absolutely knackered, but what can you do? Youre always looking behind your back and thinking will the next operation be the one where they say, Right, were worried by your sickness [leave]? You start to feel intimidated and think, Oh my god, Im going to lose my job. Despite the myriad issues trans people can face in and out of employment, there are still many whove broken through, enjoying successful careers. And there are now employers making concerted efforts to change their workplace environment, encouraging and supporting trans employees. View this image  Felix Fenlon SWNS For Reena Gibson, after three years of unemployment, she eventually found work as a teaching assistant in a specialist school in Birmingham. Work has been amazing and the staff have been so kind and wonderful, she says. I think the school has quickly tagged on to the previous skills I have and wants to make use of them. Something else happened, something that employers do not always consider: the huge benefits that can come with having trans employees. So many staff have come up to me and told me what a positive impact me being there is having, says Gibson. Not just on the students, but on the staff too. I couldnt have wished to work in a better place. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!   by Sarah A.

Hannah Riley, a 21-year-old lesbian studying at Kings College London, told BuzzFeed News that last Friday evening while out celebrating a gay male friends birthday, both the G-A-Y Late bar and the historic Heaven nightclub would not let her or her female friends in. At around midnight on 13 May, she said, the group of friends which comprised two men and four women, most of whom are gay arrived at G-A-Y Late and began queuing. We were about halfway to the front, said Riley, and one of the security staff a woman said to me, Er, ladies, have you got membership cards? And we said, No. And she replied, Well, you girls cant come in then. The member of staff did not ask the men in the group if they were members, said Riley. Hopeful that they could persuade the other door person at the front of the queue to let them in, the group of friends continued waiting until they were next in line to get in. But, said Riley, the doorman was like, Youve already been told you cant come in, so why are you still here? Facebook Twitter As the bar was not full, said Riley, it was clear to her that because only the women in the group were asked about membership and then denied access it was their sex that prompted the refusal. The doorman then advised the group to go to Heaven instead, she said. Determined not to let their night be spoiled, they arrived shortly afterwards at the nearby venue, whose regular Friday night event Camp Attack is also run by G-A-Y. But before going inside the iconic club which first opened in 1979 and has since hosted performances from countless top-billing pop stars, including Madonna, Lady Gaga, and the Pet Shop Boys the group of friends decided they wanted to get some food. Riley said she asked a male member of Heavens door staff: Can we all get back in if we come back in half an hour? Assured they would be allowed in, the group went for food then returned expecting to gain entry. But, said Riley, they were denied access, despite her reminding the security man of his earlier assurances. Riley said he accused her of lying and was then approached by another member of door staff. She asked if we had membership cards and we said, No we dont, and she said, Right, you cant come in. But, said Riley, the door staff did let in their male friend, to whom BuzzFeed News has also spoken to corroborate Rileys version of events. They said that, yes, he was allowed in and the women were not. They didnt say once, Have you all got membership cards? It was just, repeatedly, Ladies, have you got membership cards? View this image  Heaven Facebook As Riley protested against the decision, the male member of door staff accused her of being mouthy, she said, as they stood either side of a metal railing. He pushed the barrier into me and told me to leave. I said, This is really sexist, and left. One of her friends who was present has corroborated the incident. Upset, Riley approached two nearby police officers to tell them what had happened. I said, They didnt let me in because I was a woman. They [the police officers] just laughed at me. Riley and her friends gave up and caught the bus home. One of her friends has confirmed to BuzzFeed News that they complained to the security staff about what they deemed to be a sexist door policy. When approached by BuzzFeed News, Jeremy Joseph, the promoter-owner of G-A-Y and Heaven, vehemently denied that anyone was ever turned away from his clubs because of their sex. He pointed to a range of other reasons for people being denied entry, including anybody who appears to be a risk to themselves or others, and said his clubs have a door policy which gives priority to members and regulars. Joseph also highlighted the number of women on his team, both in management and working on the door, and the work his clubs have done to foster an inclusive environment. The experience of being turned away has much wider resonance for Riley and, she said, her reason for speaking publicly is about much more than one night with one group of women. Ive had really awful experiences in [straight] clubs, she said. So I dont like going to places that arent gay, so when I got turned away I was so upset. Riley described one of these previous experiences in a heterosexual venue. I was punched in the face by someone because I wouldnt let him feel my boobs, she said. I was wearing a flashing bra and he just thought he could grab my boobs. When she refused to allow him, Riley said, he assaulted her. View this image  Hannah Riley Hannah Riley LGBT venues should be safe and welcoming places for lesbians, she said. With the closure of several lesbian venues in London over recent years this is now even more vital, Riley added. If I cant go to the most famous gay bars in London, [then] where should I go? she said. I think the LGBT scene is just for gay men. Its sad that women are put off going to gay bars. Why put yourself through queuing up if theres a strong chance youre not going to get in? If those places become dominated by men [then] women arent going to want to go and that perpetuates the problem. Riley feels the LGBT scene is not diverse and doesnt even represent the community as successfully as her own LGBT student society. I dont feel you can go out in Soho as a lesbian or a trans person and feel like youll be protected, she said. People should be able to go to places and not be exposed to the same kind of discrimination as [in] wider society. In a vast multicultural city like London such a lack of diversity in venues is particularly unacceptable, said Riley. More people from different backgrounds are having the confidence to come out, and the gay scene needs to represent that. Twitter / Hannah Riley Twitter / Hannah Riley The problems, she said, are less about individual behaviour than the overall culture found in gay venues: At Ku Bar, all the people who work there are men, with no shirts on. How does that appeal to women? And the issues fan out from there, Riley said. Ive been to gay venues and used the mens toilet because theres a huge queue in the womens. That should be a place where people dont give you a funny look, and still the men are like, Why are you in here? Gay men could be more open-minded and recognise the problem, and recognise they are in a privileged position: They can go out on a gay night and be surrounded by gay men in a place that caters exactly for their needs. Both gay men and staff in gay clubs routinely assume she is not gay, said Riley, compounding the issues. They have an image of what a gay woman looks like. Because Im not butch they just think Im straight. Riley wrote an open letter to G-A-Y about her experiences and tweeted Joseph, who did not respond. But when Amy Lam, the high-profile promoter of Duckie at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern, tweeted the blog post to Joseph, he replied that because someone writes a blog doesnt make it true. Lam responded: sadly not the first time Ive heard this. And Riley replied to both: Im working almost full-time whilst sitting exams, I dont have the time to make things up. @amylame because someone writes a blog doesn't make it true, disappointed that you tweeted without checking, i'd never do that to Duckie @JeremyJoseph sadly not the first time I've heard this Other women joined in: Had a similar experience. My group of all women, some straight, was turned away too. Its not the 90s, tweeted Kate Vogelsang, a communications specialist. Id love to go to GAY more often & happy to do so alone but not to Q up only to not be sure if Id get in or not, tweeted Dorothy, whose surname is not on her Twitter handle. Sadly Jeremy this is true. No ones blaming you because youre not letting folk in but something needs sorting. @hannahtheduck @JeremyJoseph @amylame Had a similar experience. My group of all women, some straight, was turned away too. Its not the 90s. @JeremyJoseph @amylame I'd love to go to GAY more often & happy to do so alone but not to Q up only to not be sure if I'd get in or not @JeremyJoseph @amylame Sadly Jeremy this is true. No one's blaming you because you're not letting folk in but something needs sorting Team, this needs to be shared far and wide. It's a problem we need to change, because this is out and out misogyny https://t.co/GSASXDfYBB The website for Heaven says the club reserves the right to refuse admission to those deemed to be wearing unsafe footwear, specifically high heels Heaven will not admit larger parties and this includes hen nights and stag nights. BuzzFeed News put all of Rileys allegations to Joseph. His full statement in response is below: Heaven and G-A-Y, like bars and nightclubs up and down the country, are in a position where they have to turn away customers on a nightly basis where, in the judgment of their security teams and door staff it is reasonably necessary to do so to meet these obligations. In the case of G-A-Y venues they all have a strict door policy which refuses entry to anybody who appears to be a risk to themselves or others and which gives priority to members and regulars, which is a policy that has been implemented following consultation with the Metropolitan Police and Westminster Council. As a result it is sometimes necessary to turn people away, either due to their own behaviour or due to the venue being at capacity with priority being given to regular customers and members. However, nobody has ever been turned away for reasons which are not related to G-A-Ys legal obligations. G-A-Y has been a proactive exponent of equal opportunities and equal rights for decades. We take our responsibility as a prominent brand within the gay community very seriously and use it to promote inclusiveness, tolerance and to deter discrimination. We were one of the first gay bars in the capital to open a lesbian bar which has been welcoming female customers for over 12 years - this longevity could never have endured if we were discriminating against women and refusing entry on grounds of gender.. We engage female staff and contractors in the most senior and responsible roles within our Group including the female General Manager of G-A-Y Late and the female door staff at G-AY Late and Heaven who would have dealt with the complainant during the alleged visit.

aS"Trans advocates worry the hoaxes, which increased after the passing of North Carolinas HB2, could fuel anti-trans violence. View this image  BuzzFeed News On Saturday, a report began spreading online that a transgender woman was shot and killed after she followed another woman into a Colorado department store bathroom. The transgender woman began raising her voice and using explicit language towards [the other woman] while continuing to follow her into the restroom, the story said. It reported that Karen Workman allegedly fired three shots from a firearm she had in her bag, killing Donna Wright. The story, first published on a website called Associated Media Coverage (News You Can Trust), contained one section of bolded text, which it claimed was the language on a sign outside the bathroom at the department store: At Bradfords we encourage all guests to use the restroom in which they identify with. Thank you, Sincerely, The Bradfords Management Team. There is no department store in Colorado named Bradfords. Karen Workman and Donna Wright are not real people, and Associated Media Coverages website is filled with fake news stories. View this image  Associated Media Coverage / Via associatedmediacoverage.com The false report has generated more than 35,000 shares, likes and comments on Facebook. It was picked up by at least two real conservative-leaning sites, the DC Gazette, and the Tea Party News. Its one of several trans-themed hoaxes that have spread widely on Facebook in recent weeks. BuzzFeed News looked at the most shared articles from over 40 fake news websites and found other recent viral hits, including the fake story of a trans woman getting caught taking pictures of underage girls at a Target, a satirical article headlined Transgender Dog Unsure Which Tree To Pee On, and one that reported Ann Coulter Arrested For Using Womens Bathroom. A false claim that Caitlyn Jenner is going to de-transition has also been circulating for weeks. The spike in anti-trans hoaxes began after North Carolina passed a law, House Bill 2, that repealed LGBT nondiscrimination ordinances and that banned transgender people from restrooms in government-run buildings. It resulted in national coverage that caught the attention of the burgeoning fake news industry. View this image  BuzzFeed News A recent BuzzFeed News report found that they continue to drive significant engagement on Facebook, in spite of an effort by Facebook to rein them in. View this image  A man who shred the bathroom shooting hoax on Facebook said, This is just what Obama was hoping for! Facebook / Via Facebook: 1291573454189512 As you have likely noticed, the bathroom issue has really hit a nerve with evangelicals and Conservatives making it a ripe topic for ridicule, said Allen Montgomery, the pseudonym used by a man who who runs NationalReport.net and other fake news sites. These topics that highlight their (perceived) persecution complex are good business for those in the hoax and/or satire industry. He said hes only published three or four stories pegged on the bathroom issue, but that others are going after what he calls the easy money of HB2 hoaxes. The result is that fake news sites are churning out new trans-themed stories on an almost-daily basis to capitalize on the political polarization and anti-LGBT stance at the heart of HB2. Urban legends debunking site Snopes has been busy disproving the various false rumors. Up until recently, the transgender tag on the site had only five stories associated with it, dating from last summer to to March of this year. Since April the site has posted11 new stories related to transgender people. Kim LaCapria, the content manager for Snopes, said the site often sees a rise in rumours and hoaxes in the immediate wake of civil rights wins by LGBT people in general. In this case, North Carolinas anti-LGBT law came as a response to an ordinance passed in Charlotte that banned discrimination against LGBT people. The common theme with these fake stories is they validate the opinions held by folks that are just bothered by LGBT folks, according to LaCapria. View this image  This person shared the bathroom shooting hoax and encouraged women to get their concealed weapons license, saying make sure you wait until the perv quits breathing before calling 911. Facebook / Via Facebook: 10153747083606478 Trans people all over the U.S. are really really on edge right now, and every time one of [these hoaxes] comes out lots of trans people hear them and react to them, she said. Keisling is concerned that hoaxes about trans people harassing other people in bathrooms will encourage vigilantes to come out of the woodwork and hunt trans people.

aS"Parents of all genders will be able to relate to Trevor MacDonalds journey into parenthood. View this image  As he wrote in his forthcoming book, Wheres the Mother?: I would feed Jacob in bed and then gently try to put him down. Hed wake up and cry and so Id feed him again. Then Id try to put him down once more and lie down beside him, but hed immediately wake and cry. When he nursed, I could no longer hear the frequent gulping sounds that had been so exciting to everyone on Jacobs first day of life. But for MacDonald, a transgender man in Winnipeg, that distress would soon turn into a life-changing story of parenthood, milk-sharing, and community. View this image  Since transitioning, MacDonald has given birth to two children currently 5 years old and 18 months old. During that time, MacDonald and his husband had to navigate a medical system unfamiliar with the needs of trans men and grapple with trying to nurse after breast removal surgery. I wanted to share the experience in my own words and really have control of my own narrative and to be able to dig deeply into it in a way that people could relate to, MacDonald told BuzzFeed Canada. The book offers insight into what it was like for MacDonald to be both male and pregnant. But just as every cisgender parent is different, so is every trans parent. MacDonald wanted to challenge the popular tropes about trans people. Theres a narrative that we see presented in the media a lot about a certain way of being transgender, that sort of born in the wrong body narrative. And that doesnt resonate with a lot of trans people, and that doesnt resonate with me, he said. View this image  Because MacDonald couldnt produce enough milk on his own, he and his husband ended up connecting with a diverse community of human milk donors to feed their kids. They included students, military members, Mormons, and Mennonites. It was a profound experience. We met families that we never otherwise would have connected with, said MacDonald. We were just so touched that all of these different people cared so much about our baby and wanted to share in that way. Wheres the Mother? will undoubtedly become an excellent resource for trans and non-binary parents, and has even been added to the required reading list of Doula Trainings International. But parenthood isnt a walk in the park for anyone, and cisgender parents alike will see themselves in MacDonalds story.

aS"President Enrique Pea Nieto introduced a new push to codify his countrys piecemeal approach to same-sex marriage. View this image  Enrique Pea Nieto Omar Torres / AFP / Getty Images Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto on Tuesday announced that he would be sending legislation to Congress to amend the constitution to allow marriage equality nationwide. Hoy, en el Da Nacional de la Lucha contra la Homofobia, me reun con representantes de colectivos LGBTI. Escuch sus ideas y propuestas. The proposed change would amend Article 4 of Mexicos Constitution to incorporate clearly the judgment of the Supreme Court so that people can marry without discrimination on ethnic, national, disability, social status, religion, gender or sexual preference reasons, Pea Nieto said in a speech at a International Day Against Homophobia event. Currently several Mexican states explicitly allow same-sex marriages, following a string of lawsuits from couples suing for their right to wed. Last June, the Mexican Supreme Court decided that laws banning marriage are unconstitutional but the ruling was only binding on judges. Registrars in states where marriage equality isnt in place are allowed to deny issuing marriage certificates, forcing couples to sue for the ability to marry in cases they will invariably win. Despite the Supreme Court urging the recalcitrant states to change their own laws, the majority of Mexicos 31 states have not complied. The presidential Twitter account in response on Tuesday announced the signing of a reform initiative that includes the recognition of the right to get married without any form of discrimination. Though he thinks the initiative will be a success in the long run, Enrique Torre Molina, Campaigns Manager at All Out, told BuzzFeed News that proponents of marriage equality will need to rekindle the momentum once Congress returns from its current break. The announcement comes a bit late, because people have been expecting it for almost a year now since the Supreme Court made the announcement, he said, adding that the initiative was still exactly what advocates had been waiting for. Its definitely a celebration. Pea Nieto also proposed changes to Mexicos Federal Civil Code to allow marriage equality and allow members of the Civil Registry issue birth certificates that reflect the owners preferred gender identity. Mexico will also join a group of 19 countries at the United Nations promoting LGBTI issues, he announced. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"While anti-transgender bathroom bills have only recently gained momentum, gender-segregated public restrooms have been sites of gender inequity for over a century. Cultural anxieties about bodily secretions, disease, sex, shame, and power codified into law and reinforced by Hollywood have allowed the segregated institution to stand. But should we let it? View this image  Aaron Fernandez / BuzzFeed News During one of the Democratic debates last December, as a five-minute commercial break came to a close, there was a problem: Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton hadnt yet returned to the stage. The moderators, forced to abide by the constraints of live television, carried on without her, until, a few minutes later, she resumed her place at the previously empty podium. Sorry, she said, with a lets-just-move-on smile. Almost immediately, Twitter was ablaze with reports that shed been delayed in the restroom. To many female viewers, it was a relatable moment. Public womens bathrooms that are inconveniently located, clogged with long lines, and equipped with only a couple stalls (whose efficiency cant possibly match that of the three-plus urinals in many respective mens rooms) are quotidian annoyances for women. But others took Clintons mid-debate break as an opportunity to shame her for answering natures most basic call. The Monday after the debate, Donald Trump was seemingly repulsed. I know where she went. Its disgusting, he said. I dont want to talk about it. No, its too disgusting. Trumps antipathy finds itself comfortably at home in a 100-year-plus history of cultural anxieties surrounding the public restroom. Concerns about secretions, disease, and physical threats to the body are vessels through which deeper and more significant anxieties regarding gender, sex, shame, and power have been codified into law and reified by social norms over the span of decades. Now those cultural anxieties have zeroed in on trans people, who are being targeted by anti-LGBT bills ricocheting around state legislatures across the country. The most hotly contested bathroom bill has been North Carolinas HB2, which prevents trans people from using restrooms that match their gender identity in government-run buildings. The bill, and others like it, is particularly erroneous when considering trans people are far more likely to be the victims of violence in public restrooms than the cis women they purport to protect. Conservatives peddling the narrative that men in dresses will prey on little girls in restrooms were instrumental in HB2s passing; the same narrative thwarted LGBT nondiscrimination pushes in the past, in cities from Fayetteville, Arkansas to Houston, Texas. Now, both the Department of Justice and the White House have been fighting back. After North Carolina filed a lawsuit against the DOJ for its condemnation of HB2, the DOJ filed its own lawsuit against North Carolina for infringing upon trans residents civil rights. Last week began with Attorney General Loretta Lynch delivering one of the most powerful speeches ever given by a government official in the name of trans equality, and ended when, on Friday, the Obama administration sent guidelines to public schools saying trans students must be allowed to use facilities consistent with their gender identity. Many attribute the dozens of anti-trans bills that have been introduced since late 2015, and the few that have since passed including North Carolinas, one in Mississippi, and the newly recalled ordinance in Oxford, Alabama to staunch anti-LGBT backlash in the wake of marriage equality. But more broadly, this brand of anti-trans panic is bound up in the natural evolution of American public restrooms, which have perpetuated gross inequities since their inception, with racial segregation being the most obvious, and by far the most egregious, example. Whatever civil rights battle is being waged at any given time in history, you can almost guarantee that the bathroom will be a primary battleground: the place where the bogeyman lives. Trans people are only the latest marginalized group to be actively denied equal access to safe, clean, and secure public restrooms and, by extension, to equal participation in public life. Most Americans consider bathrooms divided by gender to be a given born out of anatomical differences, rather than a specific set of decisions made by a select few and governed by cultural values. Joel Sanders, a professor of architecture at Yale University and editor of Stud: Architectures of Masculinity, told BuzzFeed News in a recent phone interview that throughout the history of modern design, a governing principle in functionalism has presumed that form follows function. Consequently, many assume that the design of public restrooms has been biologically preordained a structural inevitability. The truth, Sanders says, is to the contrary: That kind of mythology that the shape of bathroom fixtures are linked to and reflect biology is one of the ways in which we use science, nature, function, anatomy, and architecture to give ostensibly objective basis for what is, in the end, something thats very culturally contingent. Functionalism, then, lends credence to the illusion of innate binary gender distinctions. Even before the late 19th century, when the first law mandating gender separation was enacted in Massachusetts in 1887, public restrooms in the United States have been designed, built, and maintained with one group of people in mind: straight, white, able-bodied cisgender men, who alone in U.S. history have been able to pee in peace. While it might seem like the current uproar over gender and bathrooms is a brand-new social development, state-sanctioned gender separations in public restrooms have adversely affected women, gender-nonconforming people, and trans people for well over a hundred years the relatively minor annoyance of being delayed in the restroom, la Clinton, only scratches the surface of the imbalance these sanctions have bred. Mens and womens restrooms we largely take for granted today are the direct result of a long history involving the continual reproduction of outmoded concepts of gender difference, which have allowed countless forms of gender inequity to flourish unimpeded. By 1920, 43 other states had joined Massachusetts in mandating gender separation in public restrooms. Terry S. Kogan, a law professor at the University of Utah, writes in Sex Separation: The Cure-All For Victorian Social Anxiety that policymakers were motivated to enact toilet separation laws aimed at factories as a result of deep social anxieties over women leaving their homes their appropriate separate sphere to enter the workforce. Though women had been leaving their homes to work in factories for decades, Kogan writes, the end of the 19th century saw a conflation of multiple social anxieties, from cholera panic left over from the Civil War to Victorian preoccupations with modesty and privacy, particularly concerning the body and bodily functions, to the mounting task of protecting fragile women in the public sphere. At the same time, burgeoning evolutionary biologists were peddling the theory that women were physically and mentally inferior to men. Thus, a collision of Victorian paternalism and junk science birthed the gender-segregated public restroom. As women became more active in various aspects of public life, they had to be fitted into the interstitial spaces of a world that had not been built for them. (Male) architects and (male) city planners began to section off areas for them to exist out in the world, but without radically disrupting the precious social fabric of Mans Land. These male decision-makers created separate spaces for women in everything from railroad cars to department stores to post offices. Public libraries, long since bastions of male status that often excluded women, began cordoning off womens spaces as soon as they were provided any access (since some men were concerned that women would be disruptive to the concentration of serious readers). These spaces, decorated like living rooms and stocked with womens magazines, provided discreet access to separate womens restrooms, precursors to the fancy ladies rooms that can still be found today in high-end hotels and country clubs. Apparently, if a woman needed to venture into the messiness of a mans world in the late 19th century, she had to be placed within a familiar pocket of domesticity. More than that, however, her weaker body needed to be protected from the bathrooms threat of dirt and disease. Kogan points out that many of the first laws mandating gender separation in water closets were actually adopted by states as amendments to and extensions of earlier protective labor legislation aimed at women workers; these laws were not intended as neutral regulations for the mutual benefit of men and women alike. But of course, these comfortable, domestic, and hygienic safe havens were only ever afforded to white women. Decades before the men in dresses will attack vulnerable ladies ruse would be used to justify anti-trans bathroom discrimination, insinuations that racially desegregating public restrooms would harm white women proved a formidable barrier to achieving civil rights for black Americans. Todays bugbear of the queer sexual deviant is directly preceded by the profoundly racist assumption, popularized after World War II, that black men would prey on white women should racial parity be established in public restrooms. As Gillian Frank detailed last November for Slate, the perceived sexual threat of sharing bathrooms with black people was coupled with a sanitary one white women emphasized that contact with black women in bathrooms would infect them with venereal diseases. While separate womens restrooms were indeed the product of sexist beliefs regarding womens fragility and (lack of) power, white women were still afforded far more favorable restroom conditions than women of color conditions they maintained for themselves through racist fearmongering. By the 1990s, a full century after the first slew of gender segregation mandates, one would assume that the relics of Victorian paternalism would no longer apply to a modern world. The civil rights movement had already seen the abolishment of bathrooms segregated by race (which, while a clear step forward, by no means ended racial discrimination in public restrooms trans people of color, for example, report problems using the bathroom at far higher rates than their white counterparts). But public restrooms remained steadfastly segregated by gender, and even the countrys most powerful women were still battling for equal access to physical slices of public life. As recently as 1992, female U.S. senators did not have their own restroom. Before Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell announced that a new bathroom for women would be built on the Senate floor, there was only a mens room there, reading Senators Only (which assumed, of course, that senators could only ever be and would only ever be men). The female senators were forced to walk a long way from the floor to relieve themselves among the tourists. And even when a restroom for female senators was finally completed in 1993, it had only two stalls; 20 years later, by which time there were 20 women in the Senate, long lines were a daily nuisance. In 2013, when a few of the senators spoke up about the inconvenience, two additional stalls were added to their restroom. Meanwhile, in the House, congresswomen also had to schlep to the tourist bathrooms in Statuary Hall until the 76 female members of the House finally got their own restroom in 2011. But the battle for equal restroom space hasnt only been waged by and for the politically powerful. Working-class women in particular have suffered as a result of bathroom segregation. In 1979, Eileen Lynch, a carpenters apprentice based in Tennessee, worked on a three-acre site with a couple portable toilets designated for women and more than 20 used mostly by men. All of them were typically filthy and lacked toilet paper. After holding her urine on the job and suffering from a urinary tract infection, she occasionally used the clean, well-stocked restrooms in the powerhouse (technically off-limits to construction workers, though she said her male co-workers used it all the time) and was fired for doing so. She filed a complaint with the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission; the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals found that women were placed at a higher risk of contracting infections due to unsanitary portable toilets. In another suit, filed in 2000 under Title VII, Audrey Jo DeClue, the first and only woman employed at the Central Illinois Light Company, complained that her employer did not provide any restroom facilities for her; while working on power lines, linemen are typically far away from any public restrooms, but male electrical workers typically have no problem relieving themselves outside, something DeClue was far more hesitant to do. (The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit decided against her.) What both Lynch and DeClues experiences highlight is that even mens and womens restrooms that are similarly clean, similarly accessible, and equipped with the same number of stalls are not necessarily equal. Professor John Banzhaf, a law professor at George Washington University and the self-described father of potty parity, says that achieving gender equity in restrooms through lawful means at first involved advocating for an equal number of mens and womens rooms in public spaces. But traditionally, mens and womens rooms have been the same physical size, he added, in a recent phone interview with BuzzFeed News. Which is not really equal, because womens [facilities] take up more space. Combined with the fact that cisgender women take longer to do their business (some studies say up to two times as long as cis men do), pregnant people need to urinate more frequently, and menstruating people need to use the restroom for an entirely different reason, Banzhaf argues that equity can only be achieved if women are given access to more facilities than men are. Separate, in this case, is not equal. When I first proposed that the consequence of separate restrooms were that women would have to wait on longer lines which could violate gender discrimination laws, or even the Constitution people laughed in my face, Banzhaf said. But by now, many states have adopted potty parity laws, which differ from state to state. In New York City, the Restroom Equity Bill, passed in 2005, called for a 2-1 ratio of womens rooms to mens rooms in newly constructed public venues, a fairly common standard. Most potty parity laws only apply to the building codes of new structures, however, which has no legal impact upon the countless older buildings that are already fixtures of public life. Neither do most address the host of other issues of convenience, access, and safety that arise from gender-segregated public bathrooms: the mother who is forced to send her young sons into the mall mens room alone; the elderly wife who cant accompany her husband with dementia into his stall; the father who cant change his babys diaper because changing tables are still mostly fixtures of womens rooms; and the gender-nonconforming person who feels profoundly unsafe in either restroom to name but a few. So how can restrooms in older buildings become more equitable, without costly construction of more multi- or single-occupancy facilities? One solution simply making every single restroom in a certain building gender-neutral has become relatively commonplace in certain (mostly urban) restaurants and workplaces, but nowhere has the strategy been employed more often than on college campuses. More than 150 colleges and universities across the U.S. have instituted some sort of gender-neutral bathroom, in a sweep thats been concentrated over the last decade, oftentimes in consultation with LGBT centers endeavoring to make their campuses more inclusive. When I went to school in the 60s, there were male and female dorms, said Banzhaf. If anyone ever suggested we could have coed dorms, that would be crazy. Women in many schools had to be locked up by midnight. Then someone started a coed dorm, but with separate floors. Then someone said, Well, gee, if we have male and female floors, how about we have everyone on the the same floor? And they tried it, and it worked out fine. Bathrooms became the next frontier; now thousands of college students of all genders share dorm restrooms across the country, without significant fanfare. Certain cities (like San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and Austin) have provisions stating that single-occupancy bathrooms in public places should be labeled as gender-neutral. But the move toward multi-stall, multi-gender bathrooms has been a much slower, stickier process outside the liberal bubbles of universities. Enter: a whole lot of cultural baggage, and the specter of the trans predator. View this image  Nancy in A Nightmare on Elm Street being preyed upon by Freddy Krueger. Hollywoods depiction of the bathroom reveals it to be one of the most powerful spaces for informing our cultural anxieties around gender, bodily shame, abjection, disease, and sexual deviance. New Line Cinema The public restroom as a site of queer stranger-danger isnt new. As Lee Edelman writes in Stud, the male restroom has long since operated as a theater of heterosexual anxiety. The way male restrooms are typically structured, along with the unwritten social code that men cant look at or speak to their neighbors while urinating, invites the fear of the abject and of homosexual desire to fester in these spaces. The AIDS epidemic in the 1980s only heightened the spread of gay panic propaganda, one element of which cast public restrooms as war zones for straight, cisgender men. Public restrooms and, perhaps even more strongly so, locker rooms have always operated in the cultural imagination as sites of strict gender roles and compulsive heterosexuality. With the notable exception of Ally McBeal, a 90s Fox sitcom about a law firm centered upon a unisex bathroom (which, instead of normalizing the concept, arguably made a conservative case for restroom gender segregation), popular culture has long established tropes associated with each restroom. The mens room is a place for aggressive macho posturing, bullying the weak, and artfully avoiding eye contact; womens rooms, meanwhile, are hyper-feminine places for girls to get primped, gossip, cry, and avoid boys boys who, in turn, fantasize about what goes on behind the closed girls room door. A number of 80s teen movies, from Pretty in Pink to Porkys to Fame, include scenes (which have inspired countless others) involving guys attempting to see into or enter the girls bathroom and they either play the attempt for laughs or treat deeply creepy peeping Tom behavior with a cavalier boys will be boys shrug. While queer men in bathrooms are a threat, straight men are just guys doing what guys do. View this image  Psychos Norman Bates, the ultimate cross-dressing villain. Paramount Pictures In the shift from drama and comedy to horror, the bathroom becomes ground zero for violence against women. In Alfred Hitchcocks Psycho, the most famous bathroom scene in cinematic history involves a woman in the shower getting stabbed to death by Norman Bates, a notoriously genderqueer bad guy. In whats arguably the other most famous bathroom scene of all time, The Shinings Jack corners Wendy in the bathroom and proceeds to hack his way in. David Cronenbergs Shivers, from 1975, features an absolutely repulsive scene involving a parasite that crawls up the bathroom drain and between a womans legs. And speaking of 80s teen movies again, Nancy in A Nightmare on Elm Street gets an unwelcome visit from Freddy Krueger while shes in the bath. If they want to avoid spiders and grudge monsters, women in horror films would do best to avoid the bathroom altogether. These scenes manage to sexualize the vulnerable and violated female body, while also suggesting that the Victorian paternalism of yore might still apply according to the fantastical versions of our modern conceptions: Women still need protecting. Hollywoods depiction of the bathroom reveals it to be one of the most powerful physical and social spaces when it comes to both revealing and informing our cultural anxieties around gender, bodily shame, abjection, disease, and sexual deviance. Just as the Equal Rights Amendment lost essential footing in the 70s due to infamous counterprotests claiming that banning gender discrimination would result in unisex toilets (which, protesters cried, would enable sexual predators), so, too, have todays social conservatives driven anti-trans panic by insisting that gender-neutral bathrooms would give (queer/trans) aggressors free rein to prey on girls. The mixing of genders in bathrooms, so our pop-cultural scripts go, results in awkward gags at best and rape and murder at worst. Anti-trans bathroom bills are, in part, the product of pop cultures queerphobic and transphobic scripts. View this image  Jack breaking into the bathroom in The Shining. Warner Bros Bathrooms trigger homophobia trans people are gay people in drag, which is a complete misunderstanding of who trans people really are as well as misogyny, Joel Sanders, the Yale professor of architecture, told BuzzFeed News. Since the dawn of gender-segregated bathrooms, proponents have maintained that the separation keeps women safe. But after a century culminating in a long string of potty parity laws, women are closer to achieving convenience without being much closer to achieving a standard of safety to say nothing of trans and gender-nonconforming people, who are straw men painted in perpetrators clothes even though they are so often the victims of bathroom violence. Its not about an architectural barrier, said Sanders. Walls never keep people out. Theres this mythology of walls as bastions and boundaries, but they can always be breached. Sanders, as well as various trans activists, contends that single-occupancy bathrooms are actually less safe for marginalized groups than multi-stalls are: The more people in a bathroom, the safer it is, said Sanders. Its a self-monitoring space. Single stalls are also potentially ghettoizing for trans and gender-nonconforming people, who might be forced to out themselves should they use them, and who are still isolated from other people. If were really going to transform society, he said, we need to create public spaces that encourage people to mix. On Monday, May 9th, the president of the state Senate and the House speaker in North Carolina filed a lawsuit against the Department of Justice, asking a federal court to decide whether civil rights laws do or dont require that trans people should be allowed into single-sex facilities that match their gender identity. The complaint begins: When people find themselves in the intimate settings of public bathrooms, locker rooms, or showers, they expect to encounter only other people of the same biological sex. Until very recently, that simple expectation of bodily privacy would have been taken for granted. What we actually take for granted is why, exactly, public restrooms are segregated in the first place. We assume building codes are purely objective, rooted in science and dictated by function. Separated restrooms, in their guise of objectivity, only manage to reinforce age-old essentialist notions of binary gender difference. What would it mean to break down those walls? The predator bogeyman the impetus behind a million anti-trans petition signatures; a villain as potent, and as pretend, as Freddy Krueger is not at the true heart of the bathroom maelstrom. Those who oppose equitable bathrooms are presumably far more afraid of what trans people represent than the nonexistent physical threat they pose. The expansive, complex, never-ending potential of gender, which separated bathrooms have veiled with the lie of their form-follows-function objectivity, is arguably what anti-trans protesters are trying to suppress along with, of course, the fundamental fact of trans peoples humanity. Under the pretense of privacy and safety, social conservatives are stoking cultural anxieties around bodily privacy, genitalia, and sexual deviance in order to keep trans people from participating in the public sphere, a fate of bathroom exclusion that befell women, people of color, families, and disabled people before them. The bogus fear of an aggressor is, at root, most likely the fear of the Other gaining power. Sanders, alongside professor, author, and theorist Susan Stryker, is embarking on a research project to determine what viable design alternatives exist to make the restroom a more equitable place for those of all genders; they will publish their results later this year in South Atlantic Quarterly. While they dont believe that functionalist architecture can necessarily make public restrooms more safe acknowledging restrooms weighted history and advocating for shifting cultural mindsets is higher on the researchers priority lists both Sanders and Stryker are in favor of functional improvements by way of one-entrance restrooms featuring European-style mixed hand-washing areas, as well as multiple stalls fitted with nearly floor-to-ceiling doors. (All the privacy of single stalls within the self-policing community of multi-stalls arguably the best of both worlds.) New buildings, however, are relatively easy to envision, while retrofitting older buildings is a tougher task. But just as the American Disabilities Act requires all building owners to conform, equitable bathrooms can theoretically be legislated into widespread reality. The trans controversy is a lens through which to think about how we can redesign social spaces to make them safe, and encourage diversity not only for trans people, for all embodied subjects, said Sanders. Gender-neutral bathrooms, by this point, are everywhere: Theyre a mainstay in Europe, cropping up ever increasingly in restaurants and other public spaces in cities across the U.S., and theyre a part of everyday life in over a hundred college campuses. For Banzhaf, the universities in particular are providing a blueprint for how mixed bathrooms can change cultural scripts around gender normativity. In the days before coed dorms, the only time men and women would see each other would be outside for class or a date, when theyd be well-dressed, and women would have their makeup on, he said. It was, he added, an artificial impression of the other. But once you have coed restrooms, when everyone has towels wrapped around themselves, their hair looks like hell I think they begin to see each other more as real people instead of constructs. People as they really are, rather than how wed like others to see us. Perhaps so, too, can sharing the public space of restrooms with trans people something everyones already done before, even those who think trans identity is just some newfangled threat created by the liberal feminist machine allow everyone, of all gender identities and presentations, to see one another as people, all equally worthy of access and safety.

aS"After Jordan Brown filed the lawsuit, Whole Foods Market sued him for defamation. View this image  Jordan Brown A gay man in Texas is dropping a lawsuit that alleged Whole Foods Market inscribed a gay slur on his custom cake with icing, saying in a statement that the company did nothing wrong. In turn, Whole Foods told BuzzFeed News that it is dropping its counterclaim against Jordan Brown and his lawyer, saying the company is very pleased that the truth has come to light. In April, Brown held a news conference alleging that he ordered a blank, prebaked cake from a Whole Foods in Austin to be personalized with the words Love Wins. But after he picked it up, he said it instead read Love Wins Fag. He sued the company for intentionally inflicting emotional distress. Whole Foods Market filed a counter-claim alleging defamation, saying that Browns accusations were false and that he had acted with malice. The company released surveillance video that it said undermined his claims. The company also argued that Browns lawyer, Austin Kaplan, brought the lawsuit in bad faith and without proper investigation. In a statement, which was reported Monday by Fox 7 and other media outlets in Austin, Brown said he was wrong to pursue the matter and use the media to perpetuate this story. I want to apologize to Whole Foods and its team members for questioning the companys commitment to its values, and especially the bakery associate who I understand was put in a terrible position because of my actions, Brown said. I apologize to the LGBT community for diverting attention from real issues. I also want to apologize to my partner, my family, my church family, and my attorney. Whole Foods responded with its own statement. Given Mr. Browns apology and public admission that his story was a complete fabrication, we see no reason to move forward with our counter suit to defend the integrity of our brand and team members, the company said.

aS'The breakout star of Master of None talked about her new fame on a panel hosted by Netflix. View this image  Lena Waithe at the Netflix panel May 14. Eric Charbonneau/Netflix A dozen women who work in front of the camera and behind the scenes on various series for Netflix discussed their work during the Rebels and Rule Breakers Luncheon in Beverly Hills on Saturday. It was there that Lena Waithe revealed that playing Denise on Master of None has yielded a few perks including adoring direct messages on social networks from strangers. Waithe, whose work on Aziz Ansaris show made her the stuff of thousands of gay lady dreams, was asked by the panel moderator how her newfound fame has affected her. Talent definitely gets you better hotel rooms, the checks are nicer, the self-described soft stud said. Followers on Instagram, definitely a lot of Caucasian straight women in the DMs. She added, I cant go into a Trader Joes or any place where theres more than one hipster. Co-sponsored by Women in Film and SAG-AFTRA and moderated by New York Magazine/Vulture Hollywood editor Stacey Wilson Hunt, the Netflix event featured Jessica Jones Krysten Ritter, Chelseas Chelsea Handler, Laura Prepon of Orange Is the New Black, and Marta Kauffman, the co-creator of Friends and Grace and Frankie, among others. Netflix / via tumblr Waithe has been celebrated by the queer female community for the authenticity of her character, who was originally written as a straight white woman; she previously told AfterEllen she would sometimes suggest changes to Denise for the sake of that honesty, particularly because there were no lesbian writers on the show. Later in the panel, Waithe advised women against being polite: Especially with women, when people tell you to be polite, you are easily taken advantage of. You are often ignored and silenced. I think for me, I always would rather be someone that people remember as a person that stood her ground and demanded someones respect, rather than someone walk away and say, Oh, she was always polite.

aS"Im voting Yes. Can I tell you why? View this image  Enda Morgan and his wife, Audrey married in 1985. They have four children Rachel, Shane, Emmet & Ellen. After retiring from the banking industry in 2008, Enda founded Blush Wedding Music, which is now one of Irelands leading wedding ceremony and reception music providers. Enda spoke about his daughter Rachel and her partner, Marion, at the launch of the Yes Equality campaign prior to the referendum in May 2015. Karl Hayden About five years ago Rachel came out to my wife and myself. It was a very harrowing evening when that happened, he said. She was shaking. She was crying uncontrollably. In such a situation it is very difficult to be a parent and to hold your child in your arms. Morgan, who has a gay brother, was deeply distressed his daughter had kept her sexuality a secret for so long. If that was how Rachel felt, then how are other people feeling? What about those people who dont have an understanding parent? he said. I asked Rachel about it, and she said, Yes Dad, there are many, many people still out there who have not come out to their nearest and dearest. This is why the referendum is so important.

Australia could become the second. The Turnbull government has pledged to hold a popular vote on the question of marriage equality if re-elected. View this image  Charlie Bird launches A Day In May. Paul Sharp However, there is considerable fear among the Australian LGBT community and marriage equality advocates that a plebiscite will divide the nation and give rise to ugly, anti-gay speech. In A Day In May, a new book by Irish journalist Charlie Bird, one can find the meat of what might happen in an Australian campaign. Somebody jokingly said that this book should go to every member of the Australian parliament, he told BuzzFeed News. The book tells the stories of LGBT people and their families across Ireland starting with Enda Morgan. What was so amazing about what he said, and indeed, the whole tenor of the campaign in Ireland, was people telling their stories, Bird said. Fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, siblings. View this image  Brian Sheehan is from Kilrush in Co. Clare. For over two decades he has been an LGBT rights advocate. He is the executive director of GLEN and was a co-director of the Yes Equality referendum campaign. Kate Nolan We told people to go out and tell stories about themselves, he said. People took their vulnerability in their hands and presented it to people. In the end, there were tens of thousands of people knocking on doors around the country. Sheehan said the campaign came at the conversations from a place of not wanting to defeat anyone. We had to find a way of reaching [people who planned to vote no] in a way that was not hostile, that was full of respect and understanding for where they were, he said. View this image  Charles Mcquillan / Getty Images When researching for A Day In May, Bird spoke to many people about their doorknocking experiences. Amidst the many respectful conversations, there were reports of rude comments, abuse, and in some cases, canvassers having holy water thrown on them. The story of one father doorknocking in rural Ireland stuck in Birds mind. The neighbour said Why are you campaigning for a Yes vote? He said Because my son is gay, Bird explained. The neighbour turned around and said When did he contract that? In some areas where Yes Equality operated, counselling was provided for canvassers. Even those who avoided doorknocking found it hard. In Ireland, good rules around referendums means on broadcast media, each side gets 50% of airtime, said Sheehan. So 50% of the time on TV, people were saying why you shouldnt be treated as an equal citizen in this country. It was very hard for people to hear that.

Marion is a member of An Garda Sochna. Rachel is Head of Casino at an online gambling start-up. Karl Hayden For young people, the familial declarations of support were particularly momentous. The bubble was punctured by our own parents, who became the most wonderful, moving advocates, said Sheehan. For young people, that gave them a great sense of hope. We know that every single family in Ireland and in Australia has someone in it who is LGBT. People understand were not talking about some other group of weird people. Were talking about ourselves. It was the strength of these family connections that pushed Yes Equality over the line. We never thought we would win over all of Ireland. The political wisdom was that we would win over a majority of the largely populated urban areas and that would carry it over the line, Sheehan said But all except one of Irelands 41 constituencies voted Yes. This wasnt an urban phenomena. This wasnt something the liberal elites in Dublin were foisting on the country. It was the people of Ireland saying the time had come to treat all of us as equal citizens. View this image  Charles Mcquillan / Getty Images Having grown up with a youth filled with fear, fear which is still there in part because youve been with it for 40 years that fear is replaced with a sense of belonging, he said.

aS'A push for marriage equality is building in Japan, but same-sex couples arent leading the charge. J. Lester Feder reports from Tokyo. View this image  Topos Graphics for BuzzFeed News TOKYO, Japan Shoko Usami decided she wanted to marry her girlfriend after watching her mother die. It was October 2013, and Usami had rushed to the hospital. She was the only relative who had the power to make the decision the doctors needed: whether to end life support. When her mother died, Usami would be left completely without family at least on paper. And she was forced to make the decision alone because her partner, Miho Okada, wasnt by her side. A nurse had shoved Okada aside when they entered the room, saying she was not a blood relative. Eight months later, on June 5, which was Usamis 46th birthday, the two women walked into the squat, white building that houses the local government of Aomori, a city of under 300,000 people at the northern tip of Japans largest island. They marched into the buildings marriage office, accompanied by around 15 friends, some of whom had flown in from Tokyo and Osaka after the couple announced their plan to marry on Twitter and Facebook. Theyd heard rumors others had tried to register before, but as far as they knew, they were the first same-sex couple to publicize an attempt to legally register a marriage in Japan. I realized that I needed a way to make our partnership official and accepted, Usami told BuzzFeed News. Their friends later told them they had difficulty breathing as a tense silence fell over the office when they announced why they were there. The clerk sat dumbfounded although almost all developed democracies recognize some form of same-sex partnership, it seemed not to have occurred to her that two women would want to get married in Japan. Their request was denied. After waiting several hours, they were given a letter that said they could not marry because Article 24 of the Constitution states that marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes. The argument theyd made to the clerk We both consent and we both have sexes had failed. From the outside, its a mystery why Okada and Usamis stand was so lonely. Some polls suggest support for marriage equality in Japan tops 50%, and there are no religious blocs or socially conservative lobbies organized to oppose LGBT rights in the country. But one of the most striking features of marriage equality in Japan has been just how few same-sex couples are confronting their government to demand it. Now, for the first time, a path to partnership rights may be opening not because of a growing clamour from gays and lesbians, but because of the Olympics, which are coming to Tokyo in 2020. The organizers believed the showdown over LGBT rights that led up to the 2014 games in Russia guaranteed Japans record on the issue would be put under the microscope as their games approached, and they wanted to show the world they stood with countries like the United States and Germany on the issue. View this image  Shizuo Kambayashi / AP Some local governments have set up largely symbolic registries for same-sex couples, even though partnership protections arent on the table in parliament the Diet for now. But the question is being forced by some of Japans most powerful institutions: global corporations, which are giving spousal benefits to gay employees for the first time. But very few couples have come forward to claim these new benefits, and even fewer are publicly demanding their rights like Usami and Okada. Just a handful of other couples have followed their lead since, and even the two-year-old group Equal Marriage Alliance Japan (EMA-Japan) seems deeply uncomfortable with personalizing the issue. Though Usami and Okada kept up their protest by again attempting to register in 2015 and are considering doing it again this year, Okada said, Weve never been asked by anybody to come and talk about our experience for such a campaign, including EMA-Japan. Im not sure if theyre even looking for this. Theyre not, said EMA-Japans director, Kazu Terada. I dont want somebody to sacrifice their life by publicizing their relationship, Terada said. And he shies away from speaking about why marriage equality is important to him, too. I want my personal life quiet, peaceful, not so exposed to everyone, he said. I dont get why sacrifice is necessary to realize the cause. The question for Japans marriage equality movement is whether it can win while the demand remains largely invisible, or will it have to become a vocal political movement ready for a national fight. When Aya Kamikawa, a councilwoman on the government of Tokyos Setagaya ward, first decided she wanted to create a partnership registry, she couldnt find any couples to support it. She had met three couples who told her privately that they wanted to get married, and so she approached them with an offer to escort them to the registrars office, find them an attorney, and help with a media strategy that would protect their identities while publicizing marriage discrimination. They all declined. In over a decade in office, she said, no gays or lesbians in her ward had ever written to the city to complain about discrimination. I strongly wanted to promote same-sex marriage, Kamikawa said during an interview at Setagayas ward office. The registry wouldnt bring many concrete benefits it would give couples an official-looking certificate and call on hospitals and businesses to treat them as if they were married but it was a way to make the statement. But without couples to be the face of the proposal, she said, I imagined it would be shot down as a very low priority if I actually brought it up because theres no visible need for such a system. The reluctance of gays and lesbians to speak up was bewildering to Kamikawa, whose political career was launched out of her personal fight to be legally identified as female. While meeting with members of the Diet to push for a gender identity law, she was reportedly told by a lawmaker that she could only make her case if she went public with the cause. So, in 2003, she ran for council of Setagaya ward, the largest local government inside the city of Tokyo. She went on to win her seat with one of the highest vote totals, becoming Japans first transgender lawmaker. Three months after her election, the Diet unanimously voted in favor of the gender identity law. Transgender people had no choice but to throw themselves into politics, Kamikawa said. Sex-reassignment surgery was effectively banned until the mid-1990s, and people could not get jobs or rent apartments if their appearance didnt match the gender recorded in their family register, an identity document that records a persons family and their birth order. Adoption of the gender identity law made the treatment of transgender people a concern of the government, but there was nothing in national law that protected the rights of gays and lesbians. I always thought it was strange that the T was getting a lot more attention than LGBs, Kamikawa said. Many of the countrys gay and lesbian organizations have been local and focused on providing services like support for bullied teens or isolated gay seniors and not in lobbying for a major change to national laws. Gays and lesbians had never had an urgent need to organize to push through major reforms, Kamikawa said. Issues like family rejection are experienced as private problems there was no widespread problem of hate crimes or police harassment that pushed gays and lesbians into politics in many other countries. To the extent there has been a public face of same-sex marriage in Japan, it was Koyuki Higashi and her wife, Hiroko Matsuhara, who held a wedding ceremony in 2013 at Japans Disneyland but did not seek to legally marry. The flood of publicity turned them into minor celebrities, but rather than inspiring others to follow their lead, it sparked griping that they were seeking publicity or that marriage was a concern just for the elite. View this image  Koyuki Higashi, right, and her partner, Hiroko Masuhara Yuri Kageyama / AP Unlike the transgender people, [gays and lesbians] were not crying out to say [the law] is a serious issue in my life, Kamikawa said. Theyre all in the closet even though they dont have the benefits that partnership would have. Kamikawa continued to search for spokespeople for her partnership plan, ultimately finding some same-sex couples in her ward through friends of friends. She started a study group for them in January 2015 to educate them about why its important for them to be visible to the mayor and all the policy makers. Several couples came with her when she finally brought her proposal to other city officials in the spring of 2015, including one of 23 years, both of whom worked for the city, and another of 21 years, one of whom was from France. There was an attitude among lawmakers, as one in a nearby ward had said, that homosexual couples dont last long, and Kamikawa felt the meeting was pivotal to changing their minds. In July 2015, the mayor adopted her plan, and she helped design a special certificate for all the couples who registered. A couple of months prior, a neighboring ward called Shibuya had passed a similar plan. Its sponsor, then-councilman Ken Hasebe, said its goal was to show people who think same-sex marriages lead to the destruction of the family institution will realise that nothing actually changes for them. The couple who held their ceremony at Disney was the first to register in Shibuya, but since then just seven others have done so in the ward, which has a population of 200,000. Fewer than 30 couples have registered in Setagaya, which has a population of 900,000 people. And yet, other cities are moving to adopt similar frameworks to show support for gay and lesbian rights despite the low uptake. Even if couples shy away from making public stands in Japan, they seem to be willing to object privately to marriage discrimination. When a small group of lawyers calling itself the Legal Network for LGBT Rights put out a call last year for testimony about marriage discrimination, more than 400 people responded. People told stories of being kept from their partners bedsides in hospitals, of losing their homes after a partners death, or fearing their partner could lose custody of their children if they were to die. The lawyers arent taking any marriage equality cases to court they fear the constitution would doom a suit before it began so theyre using their brief to ask the Japan Federation of Bar Associations to push lawmakers to change the law. Theyre getting support from a group of lawyers with some of the top foreign firms with Tokyo offices including Freshfields, Morrison Foerster, Hogan Lovells, and Linklaters who are preparing an accompanying brief. Figuring out how to bring these stories to the public is key for marriage equality advocates, said Evan Wolfson, founder of the U.S. group Freedom to Marry. Wolfson was brought to Japan in February by EMA-Japan, which organized a four-city speaking tour for him in honor of the groups second anniversary. Wolfsons visit also received some funding from the U.S. embassy and his ticket was donated by Delta Airlines. They totally recognize that they need to step up their game on storytelling and [raise] the voices of real gay people, said Wolfson, who headlined a fundraiser that raised $100,000 for the group and who has offered to help raise more funding from international donors. He said this might have to look very different than it did in America, though, because unlike in the United States, they dont really have the culture of speaking up and telling their stories. I share the idea with Evan that enlightening LGBT people is the most difficult task I can feel it, said EMA-Japans director, Kazu Terada, who works as a political officer at the Danish embassy in Tokyo and was formerly a Japanese diplomat and aide in the Diet. Evans way may be the best way. Or there may be another way better for this country. Just after Wolfsons visit, two Americans whod been serving as EMA-Japans vice president and communications director left the group, in part because of tension about how hard to push gays and lesbians to organize and speak out in support of marriage equality. Individually, theres a mindset that our community has been plugging on just fine, [so] dont rock the boat Japans motto is dont rock the boat, said Malia Mullen, the groups outgoing communications director. Where in the U.S., it has to become this huge community movement to move the government its going to have to be a much more even footing here, Mullen said. The more the government accepts it, the more youll get community members who accept it. And some of those whose stories would make the best case for marriage equality are those who feel the most vulnerable. Even if theyre not worried that family and co-workers might not reject them for coming out, theyre concerned their coming out could cause embarrassment or discomfort for those close to them. I think that coming out of the closet isnt necessary and I dont think they should be forced to do it, said a man who asked to be identified only as Kentaro. He was ejected from the hospital room of his partner of 11 years as he lay dying, was barred from leading his funeral, and then lost the apartment they had shared. Hes now involved with EMA-Japan and starting a support group for people whove lost a partner, but he doesnt want to be identified by his full name because people at work dont know that hes gay. Instead of the people themselves having to suffer, we have to change the surroundings it doesnt make sense that people have to suffer by coming out, he said. Besides, he said, with the Olympics coming up, [marriage equality] is probably going to happen hopefully. Tokyos Olympics bid was chaired by Hiroshi Hase, a former pro wrestler who used to compete as part of a tag team called the Viet Cong Express and briefly held a world heavyweight championship title. Now he is Japans minister responsible for education and sport, and he also chairs a multi-party LGBT working group created in the Diet last year. When the conflict around Russias anti-LGBT law threatened to upstage the 2014 Olympic games, Hase told BuzzFeed News, he became convinced that LGBT rights had become a global social issue. As a committee chair in 2003, Hase had been involved in passage of the gender identity law, and he was concerned as he looked ahead to the Tokyo games that Japanese law has no broader definition for LGBT issues, though, for now, he said, partnership rights are not something he supports. We have to respect traditional Japanese family values, Hase said. At the same time, within that majoritarian and traditional family system, we still have to respect the human rights of people who live a societal existence that just cannot adapt to such a system. View this image  Tokyo Rainbow Pride Thomas Peter / Reuters Hases vision for the working group is modest, tamping down expectations of any new legislation to be enacted before 2020, instead saying that lawmakers should first try to raise awareness about what it means to be gay or lesbian. His ruling Liberal Democratic Party last month released a proposal largely focused on research and education about LGBT issues, though also called for government agencies to be more aggressive in housing or other places where existing law could be interpreted to prohibit discrimination. The LDP Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, has been chilly to opening the door to marriage equality. I believe we have to overcome one step by 2020 at the latest making the entire nations public acknowledge the importance of LGBT rights, Hase said. But major corporations are beginning to pick up the idea of offering partnership benefits to their gay employees, and the status in Japanese society of these companies is helping to bring the idea into the mainstream. One of the most visible backers of LGBT rights in the media is Goldman Sachs Japan operation, which became one of the first companies to introduce partnership benefits in 2014 under a global policy set in its New York headquarters. Deutsche Bank was among the firms to do the same in 2015, and in early 2016 two of Japans largest corporations, Sony and Panasonic which is also one of the International Olympics Committees top global sponsors announced they would follow suit. A workplace equality group called Work With Pride launched a new index this month to try to build on this momentum, and its supporters say this kind of peer pressure can nudge business culture to a tipping point very quickly. But none of these companies report large numbers of gay employees rushing to sign up for these benefits. This is a culture of choosing the established offering rather than actually being inside and asking for [benefits] to be provided, said Masakazu Yanagisawa of Work With Pride, who also heads global prime finance sales for Deutsche Bank. The expectation among LGBT people is very, very low. Thats partly why people dont spend the time and money for this movement its kind of like we give up. But this may have to change if gays and lesbians truly want marriage equality to come to Japan, suggested Setagaya councilwoman Aya Kamikawa. Personally, I wonder why people dont speak up for their rights, Kamikawa said. Because if you stay silent, nothing is going to change for you. CORRECTION The Setagaya partnership plan was implemented by the wards mayor. A previous version of this article incorrectly stated it was through legislation adopted by the council.

aS"Not all trans and gender-nonconforming people feel trapped in the bodies they were born into. So why is that still the dominant way to think about trans experience and identity? Maybe it doesnt have to be. Meredith: Welcome everyone. Ive gathered us all here to talk about gender dysphoria, and specifically the model that has become the most prevalent in the trans community: that trans people feel like they were born in the wrong body from early childhood. Its an idea thats prevalent in a lot of movies and literature, and is also an important way that medical professionals often assess whether to give people access to trans-related medical care. So my first question is, does this model resonate with you? Also, you can introduce yourself and how you identify and your pronouns and all that. Nico: Im a gender variant queer fat femme from Brooklyn, my pronouns are he, and they. I dont identify with the model of having been born in the wrong body in order to be trans. Growing up as a fat queer person, my body has always been something I should not be allowed to identify with, love, or accept. Being trans meant that too. The more I wanted to explore my body, and push the socially imposed boundaries of presentation, the more I was encouraged to explore a hypermasculinity in order to validate myself, my identities and my journey. For me, coming into myself is to unapologetically let myself be what I want to the radical self-determination and to reclaim the agency over my body, my hair, my voice, and my skin. Jacob: Im a genderqueer femme from North Carolina whos now living in NY and trying to pretend like Im a city mouse, and my pronouns are they/them. The traditional model of trans identity the idea that trans people have to feel like were in the wrong body really got in the way of me understanding myself as trans. For the longest time, I didnt think that I counted as trans because I thought you had to hate your body in order to be part of the trans community. Standing in front of the mirror, all on my own, without anyone to judge me, Im not sure if Ive ever really had an issue with my body. Tiq: I identify as a trans man, pronouns he and him. Im a writer, media maker, and trans rights advocate. The idea that being born in the wrong body seems to be the most commonly used and most simplistic way of explaining the transgender experience, but it never really fit my narrative. I never felt I was born in the wrong body, I just evolved away from it. Meredith: To answer my own question, Im a medically-transitioned nonbinary trans woman (they/them or she/her pronouns) and I dont really resonate with this model. I didnt feel particularly alienated with my body until I started presenting as female, and even then, it was more about how other people perceived me rather than some deep-seated sense that my body felt wrong. Tiq: Did you all recognize being trans at a young age? Could you name that you were transgender or did it manifest as something different? Jacob: When I was a kid, I didnt know the word trans or anything. And I didnt really feel like a boy or a girl per se. I just had like WAY TOO MUCH gender. I had gender pouring out of my ears. I wanted all the butch things and the femme things and everything in between (although I never got the violent/aggressive thing that so many young boys do). I just wanted to play with bugs and make cakes in my Easy Bake Oven and roll around in the mud in a tutu all at the same time, yknow? Nico: No I definitely didnt recognize being trans as being trans, thats for sure. I really just felt like I was so many things and the words I had access to didnt suffice to capture it. So for a long time, I just didnt really place a lot of value in words to identify myself. Meredith: Me neither, and over the years Ive been encouraged to think this was some sort of false consciousness, that somehow I unconsciously knew Im trans and just didnt recognize it. And Ive realized over time that doesnt really resonate with me. I was who I was pre-transition a third-gender kid in the Philippines, a gay man in the States for a certain period of time, then a binary trans woman, and now a nonbinary transfemme. I really honor all of those identities and dont think of them as being stepping stones towards some sort of ultimate state. Im just a person who changes over time and feels differently about myself, and thats fine. Tiq: I didnt know I was transgender. And the only reason I knew I was a girl was because I wasnt allowed to do what the boys did. I couldnt ride my bike to the park. I got in trouble for climbing trees and messing up my hair. I had to cross my legs and not get dirty. Being a girl was about limiting my body under the guise of protecting me. I associated being free and uninhibited with being a boy, and that was my first introduction to the gender binary. I think if I had the language or knew that being a trans boy was a possibility, I would have come to that truth much sooner. Jacob: Meredith, I love the way that you said that your identities havent been stepping stones towards some sort of ultimate state. I feel like that helps reduce the pressure that many of us feel to make up our minds and choose an identity already. Meredith: Were just so encouraged to think of our narratives as a linear, upward trajectory. Im not climbing a mountain; Im just on a boat navigating the vast ocean of gender! Jacob: Cue The Lonely Islands Im On A Boat! Tiq: Is there a lot of pressure within trans community for nonbinary folks tolikepick a team? I for one have felt pressures, in queer space to be less masculine and more nonbinary, but I think a lot of that has to do with the perception that black masculinity, in how I embody it, is dangerous, undesirable (unless fetishized) and makes folks uncomfortable. But fuck it. Be scared. BOO! Jacob: Okay, well, if anyone is scared of your black masculinity then they need to probably just check their racist ass into some sort of program (Does that exist? We probably should start it) Tiq: Could you imagine a 30 day rehab program for racists! We could stage an intervention like on that show. Famous reformed racistshmmmHillary Clinton? Is that bad? Jacob: Paula Deen presents Antiracist Rehab: An American Experience. Nico: Ha. To answer Tiqs question, I feel a lot of pressure to abandon the parts of me that are feminine in order to perform masculinity in an acceptable way. Being Nuyorican, theres a really particular femininity that folks whether in my family or community will accept. The way I identify the parts of myself to be masculine or feminine are not the same. So I feel pressure to identify certain things as femme and others as masculine. Like theres no room to break down and redefine when so many definitions of masculinity are harmful, and when we can claim how we define them, or how we explore them; theres so much there about colonialism that has just forced us to conform even our thoughts. Jacob: I get so grumpy about this stigma. I think that cis people have this idea that trans people pressure nonbinary people into being more binary to like support the cause or whatever. And politically, I think some of that has been true. If you look at how mainstream organizations have talked about the trans community in the past, its been in a super binary way. But that only happens because cis people are so intent on undermining the identities of binary-identified trans people. Meredith: Preach! Nico: I think thats a mad important point. How have trans people been impacted to adhere to the binary and how does that show up within trans and gender variant or deviant spaces? Tiq: And with all this bathroom nonsense happening, I feel like the people who are going to be disproportionately affected are gender-nonconforming folks. No one is stopping me in the mens room, and I think we in trans community need to hone in on that as we continue to speak back to these laws. I appreciate all the binary trans folks breaking the law in North Carolina, but the shit really hits the fan and gets dangerous when a genderqueer person whose pronoun is they tries to use the public toilet. Jacob: Totally hear you on that Tiq. The other group of folks that I think that these bills really impact are low-income trans folks. Because transitioning to a level that passes in the gender binary takes hella money and resources. So folks who dont look convincing in their gender identity, who are perceived to be gender-nonconforming (regardless of whether or not they identify that way) are going to be targeted. Ugh. Its a mess. Its like the poorer folks (who in the context of the US are disproportionately people of color) and the weird nonbinary kids are still forced to sit at the back of the bus. Tiq: So true Jacob! Come through!!! Meredith: Nico, to speak to your point, and were getting into tough territory, if we recognize that were living in a social system and that system (including medical gatekeepers, institutions, etc.) encourages us to be more binary, to what extent are binary trans people shaped by that social system? Like, I guess its just hypothetical, would we see more nonbinary people if there was no societal pressure to be binary? Tiq: Good question, Meredith, and I really started to think about the societal pressures to be binary after I interviewed Myles Brady, a trans guy from Chicago, for a piece on binding and top surgery. He came out as a trans boy at 5. His parents affirmed him and raised him as a boy and he hasnt felt any need at all to have any surgeries. And hes coming off of T. He passes as non-trans but feels no pressure to change his body at all to be more binary. So that got me thinking, did I just drink the Koolaid? Is there a place on the gender spectrum where I didnt have to change my body? Did I only do it to be more binary? Im not sure, but I do know Im happy with my decision to make my body as masculine as possible, but I also think if there werent these pressures I would not have approached gender-affirming surgeries with such urgency. Nico: Hell yeah. I think theres so many pieces to this that Im not even going to pretend to know them all. But if we can understand that gender, the terms, the structures, all of that is imposed on us, our bodies and who we are, then really what would it look like if there wasnt a binary? I think there would be so much more safety to explore the huge ocean of possibilities. And a lot of times, when Im talking about gender, my expression or identity in particular, with another trans person who is binary, often the conversation is about whether or not I want to be a boy. And if I am trans, then naturally the way that is defined is to hate wherever youre at and want to move away from it. The away being whatever is the only other option. But can I be a boy and still really slay my makeup? Can I not be a boy or a girl and still be femme? Jacob: Ironically, I wonder if wed actually have FEWER nonbinary people if we didnt have as much binary pressure. I feel like so much of my identity comes as a deeply necessary rebellion against a world that stigmatizes and shames who I am. If I lived in a world that fully loved and affirmed me in my gender expression, one that wasnt governed so strongly by the gender binary, I might not even need the term nonbinary because there wouldnt be a rubric to be judged by in the first place. Thats the dream. By the time Im a grandma, I just want to hang out on my porch and not have to have some deeply politicized term for my gender. I dont want to be old and a nonbinary activist. I want to be old and a weird grandma who sits on her porch all day drinking mint juleps and reading feminist theory. I hope the label, one day, can fade away because it isnt vital like it is today. Tiq: Yeah, the term nonbinary reinforces the binary. Meredith: I dont think I would have medically transitioned had I been a baby trans person today. It doesnt mean I regret having done it 14 years ago (!!!), because at that moment thats how I wanted to be trans, but I happen to be one of those people whose gender shifts a lot in relation to my environment and Ive learned to be cool with that. Jacob: Yeah, those spoiled brats who grew up with tumblr are lucky! They have like twenty different labels for their gender identity by the time theyre fifteen. Okay I have another fun question about bodies, and its one that I legitimately need advice on. How have yall learned to navigate intimacy, flirting, and all of that without relying on the binary and feeling good in your bodies? I feel like, as trans folks, we say dont reduce us to our bodies! and yes, dont do that, but also I have a body and I need to figure out how to be intimate with it in a way that feels good! Meredith: Ive always been a weirdly overconfident dater so its never been a *huge* issue from me in all my identities (of course Ive had my share of bad times / heartbreak but who hasnt?). The thing that I tend to tell people is that when you meet a stranger, they dont know you, so theyre learning how to be with you based on how you are. So if youre the type of person who, whatever your body / identity is and youre like, here I am and Im lovable and fuckable, its much more likely for the other person to be attracted to you, than if you didnt give off that vibe. Jacob: I think youre right about that, Meredith. I was at a Game of Thrones toga party the other day and was wearing these big ol heels and a cute skirt and little else and was flirting with all of these boys that, according to conventions of gay male culture, ostensibly shouldntve been flirting back. But the confidence that I had really overpowered the scripts that weve been given about who is desirable/lovable/fuckable and that was super nice. Right now, the idea of sealing the deal and being naked with someone is scary because, when I dont have the signifiers of my femme identity on my body anymore, Im worried that people are just going to look at me and be like okay so once you have your dress off youre kind of just a man again. Meredith: Of course its harder to be confident when the world is being shitty, as it so often is with trans people, but I guess Ive been fortunate to have a super-supportive family and grew up in a small town where everyone was super-nice to me even though I was, not just feminine but albino. So it wasnt ingrained in me that there was anything wrong with me, and I know thats a struggle for a lot of trans folks. Tiq: Ive never felt as good in my body good until the relationship Im in now. Ive been able to be present in my trans body during intimacy because I have a partner who isnt invested in binary ideas of how my body should look or perform. I started my transition ten years ago and its taken until now to be in a healthy place in my body. I dont know if I would have ever arrived at this point without the outside affirmation. Nico: Tiq, I feel the same way. In being intimate with other people who were not invested in the binary idea of gender or intimacy or relationships, it really opened the possibility for me to be intimate in a way that isnt worried at all about social constructs. And Jacob, I hear you on how much of our identity is attributed to how we dress or what we put on, and its so scary when you get to that moment where youre naked and youre like Okay. Here I am. Ive always been so scared of that moment. People will attribute my fatness to womanhood and when Im naked, it makes it really obvious who is about that life and who isnt. But honestly, my fat queer body is always being squeezed into a tiny idea of who I am and how Im allegedly (or actually) hiding that from other people. This idea of existing in the world and then getting naked and how that moment is where youre being sort of proven guilty of lying. Its so violent, and we know so many examples of how that moment has made people think they were entitled to hurting, and killing trans people. Meredith: Such realness, Nico. For me its this experience of taking it for granted that naked me is part of who I am and the other person should recognize that, and then having moments of sheer disappointment. Nico: Tuh! Disappointment! Meredith: But maybe Im just an eternal optimist because I seem to keep doing it, just feeling like theyre attracted to me clothed so they should be attracted to me naked, and remembering the people for whom that was true. So basically, are we agreeing this trapped in your body thing is bogus, or is only applicable to a segment of trans people or what? Is it even *most* trans people? Tiq: I think it is applicable to some trans people. I dont want to invalidate anyones experience. But I also think that being trapped in the wrong body speaks to socially-enforced gender binary ideology. Jacob: I think were all trapped in our bodies. Were all just pink fluffy unicorns on the inside, pink fluffy unicorns who are forced to live in these weird human forms. That is my concluding thought. View this image  Cartoon Network Nico: I agree, I dont want to discredit other folkss narrative but I do think so much of that born in the wrong body is ultimately about still fitting into this neatly packaged idea of gender. Either youre cis and youre fine or youre trans and its okay because youre working really hard to look and conform to the opposite gender. This makes it easier to consume, easier to accept than accepting something that destroys and challenges cisness, and all things gender-related like being a person who just wants to do whatever the fuck they want with their body and societys definitions just not being enough. Jacob: Quick sound-off. If you had to pick one character from the Powerpuff Girls who best represents your gender identity who would it be? Nico: I would be the Taino Boricua person they didnt think of. But low-key Buttercup. Just like a more representative, inclusive Buttercup lol. Jacob: Im Him (but I use they/them pronouns) Tiq: Buttercup! Of course. Meredith: Im just a happy transgender unicorn is what I am! Nico: Yes you are, Meredith! Yes you are.

aS"Dan Patrick told Texas superintendents to not enact President Obamas policy on transgender bathrooms. View this image  Texas Lt. Governor Dan Patrick told school superintendents not to obey President Barack Obamas transgender bathroom policy, adding that the state will not be blackmailed by the federal government. On Friday, the Obama administration sent guidelines to public schools saying they cannot discriminate against transgender students When a school provides sex-segregated activities and facilities, transgender students must be allowed to participate in such activities and access such facilities consistent with their gender identity, says a copy of the letter obtained by BuzzFeed News. The rules apply to restrooms, locker rooms, sports teams, fraternities, sororities, housing, and more. Patrick called Obamas guidelines a huge mistake that will lead to bullying, but not of the transgender kids, the straight kids. He added that the new policy would be the end of public education because this will make parents opt to home-school their children or send them to private schools. Parents are not going to send their 14-year-old daughters into the shower or the bathroom with 14-year-old boys, he said. Its not going to happen. The lieutenant governor went on to say that not enacting the policy will not affect businesses and the economy. When asked by a reporter about musicians canceling concerts because of the policy as was done in North Carolina by Bruce Springsteen Patrick said big deal, so some artist doesnt want to come to an area. Theyll fill the date with someone else who does. This will not impact business, Patrick said. The business community will figure this out real quick. Patrick did not confirm whether he plans to file a lawsuit against the federal government but said hes been talking with the attorney general. This is very new, he said. We have to talk through this. Lets be very clear what our position is; were not going to be blackmailed by the president and were not going to sell out of children for 30 pieces of silver 3.

aS"So simple. So colorful. Slaaaaayyyyy. A drag queen is commonly called vestida (dressed), from where the title of the series comes. What I do is to strip them from their clothes and then get them desvestidas (undressed). This is where the male part becomes evident, and a game of double identity between masculine and feminine is generated, photographer Luis Aguirre says. View this image  Luis Arturo Aguirre I remember the first time I saw a drag queen, Aguirre said about the series origins. It was a moment that shocked me and stayed in my memory. I was seven or eight years old, with an aunt to do some shopping in the central market in Acapulco. We passed a fruit stand and there he was with his curly hair, very dark skin, strong arms, eyelids painted with electric blue eye shadow and his red lips. Psale Gerita! he said to my aunt. I dont really know if his voice or his body caused me confusion or amazement. Aunt, what is he? I asked. Ah, he is a drag queen, she answered me. There was no more answers than that and I didnt ask more questions. The project stems from my amazement at drag queens. The ability to become such incredibly beautiful women amazes me. Through fillings they give new forms to their bodies; with wigs and makeup they change their factions and feminize their looks.

aS"The Department of Health and Human Services issued a final rule under Obamacare on Friday that prohibits denying health care or health coverage on the basis of gender identity. View this image  Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Mathews Burwell, right, and Barack Obama. AP / Evan Vucci Just hours after the Obama administration on Friday stood up for transgender students, it took unprecedented steps to protect transgender patients. Transgender people must be provided transition-related services and cannot be denied health care by providers or professionals who receive federal funding, according to a final rule announced Friday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The rule specifically bans the denial of coverage or health care itself on the basis of gender identity. The rule, which comprises several regulations, was formed under Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, which includes first-of-its-kind civil rights protections in health care for several classes of people including a ban on discrimination on the basis of sex. In protecting transgender people, federal officials cite legal trends in both courts and federal agencies to conclude the ban on sex discrimination encompasses gender identity. The policies apply to providers and insurance carriers that serve millions of Americans. During a comment period last fall, some groups requested that the rule should exempt faith-based providers from providing particular services, such as services related to gender transition, that are inconsistent with their religious beliefs, the rule says. However, it continues, federal officials decided against including a blanket religious exemption, instead noting that existing federal laws that protect religious freedom were already sufficient. LGBT advocates had hailed an earlier draft of the rule, which was released last September, for telegraphing the unprecedented new federal protections for LGBT people. By including gender identity in the regulations, they said, insurance and service providers would have to cover drugs, surgeries, and other services associated with some transgender peoples gender transitions. While the final rule does not explicitly ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, the guidance does cover sex stereotyping. The rule suggests that legal trends on that issue may cover gay, lesbian, and bisexual patients. In a press release Friday, the Department of Health and Human Services said its civil rights office will evaluate complaints that allege sex discrimination related to an individuals sexual orientation to determine if they involve the sorts of stereotyping that can be addressed under 1557. HHS supports prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination as a matter of policy and will continue to monitor legal developments on this issue.

aS"My family and I are incredibly hurt. Facebook: angus.mccormack.5 Angus McCormack arrived at the Sacred Heart Cathedral in Bendigo, Victoria, on May 6 to attend the annual Foundation Day Service run by his former high school, Girton Grammar. However, just after his arrival, McCormack was asked to leave by deputy head Robyn MacCulloch, as he was dressed inappropriately. Not wanting to create a scene, McCormack says he left immediately. My family and I are incredibly hurt by the actions, he wrote on Facebook, in a post that has since garnered thousands of likes, shares, and comments. This kind of discrimination against any person regardless of their gender, race, sexual orientation or beliefs is just utterly appalling. He was attending the event as a guest of his father, Christopher McCormack, who was on the Girton Grammar School board but has now resigned. View this image  Angus McCormack / Via Facebook: angus.mccormack.5 Prior to the event, the school had requested in an email to Christopher McCormack that his son wear a suit, as they would be seated at the front of the church. I was originally considering rocking a dress and some killer heels! Angus McCormack wrote. However, I decided to tone down my appearance and be respectful to their wishes. Therefore, I decided to wear minimal makeup, a single small earring, neat black leather pants, a white shirt with a black bow tie and black designer jacket. A suit by any definition of the word, although not in the typical commercial fabrics. View this image  Headmaster's Welcome / Girton Grammar / Via youtube.com At no time, past or present, has Angus been discriminated against on grounds of sexuality in any way by Girton Grammar School, the statement read. According to the statement, McCormack was informed his attire was inappropriate, but not asked to immediately leave. Angus may have felt that he had no choice but to leave, Maruff said. His quick departure left no opportunity for an alternative outcome to be achieved. On Thursday, Maruff told the Bendigo Advertiser that although he had not seen McCormacks attire, it was inappropriate for a person in the VIP party at the event. What we would call lounge suit would be the appropriate attire, he said.

aS"Shes directed Mel Gibson, Jennifer Lawrence, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, and herself. Heres what Jodie Foster has learned along the way. View this image  Jodie Foster Mario Anzuoni / Reuters Jodie Foster has been in the entertainment industry for 50 of her 53 years, going from a Coppertone commercial at age 3 to series television and then to film. She was 14 years old when she was first nominated for an Oscar for playing a prostitute in Martin Scorseses Taxi Driver and 26 when she won Best Actress for the first time, for the 1988 movie The Accused. She won again soon after for playing Clarice Starling the character who created an entirely new archetype for a female hero in 1991s The Silence of the Lambs. Given Fosters background, it is not surprising that she wanted to direct movies from a young age. In a recent interview in Beverly Hills, she called her childhood self a power-hungry 7-year-old who had learned early that directing was the way to get to realize the full vision of the film, and having every part of you expressed. She was not only in movies, but she was also a film buff. My mom took me to all these European films, Foster said. Lina Wertmller: That was the first time I had ever seen there was a woman director, and I loved those movies, and I would see them over and over and over again. And so Foster started paying attention, she said, and saying, Why did he do that? Why did he choose this? View this image  Jack OConnell as Kyle, with George Clooney as Lee. TriStar Pictures The fourth movie that Foster has directed, Money Monster, a hostage thriller reminiscent of 70s films such as Dog Day Afternoon, will be released on May 13. It co-stars George Clooney as Lee Gates, a cynical finance channel shill, who touts stocks without considering the consequences; Julia Roberts as Patty Fenn, the producer who has grown out of working with him; and Jack OConnell as Kyle, the angry, duped regular guy who blew his only cash on one of Lees tips, and seizes control of the station, with a bomb and a gun, on live television. Foster sat down with BuzzFeed News to discuss her directing career so far. She was open about how her films have reflected her life, and quick to laugh. She claimed she still enjoys being interviewed, even after all this time. I like talking about the movies, she said. Who else am I going to talk to about them? Little Man Tate (1991) View this image  Adam Hann-Byrd, Jodie Foster. Orion Pictures Corp/Courtesy Everett Collection Little Man Tate tells the story of a 7-year-old prodigy named Fred Tate (Adam Hann-Byrd) living in semi-squalor in Cincinnati with his waitress mother, Dede (Foster). Foster had been sent the script, written by Scott Frank, as an actor, but it piqued her interest as a possible first directing project. They laughed about that, she said, without elaborating on who they were. She persisted, and found a way to get the movie financed with her directing and co-starring. Foster was 27 at the time, and credits her age with having the confidence, or maybe the bravado, not to question whether it was wise to direct both herself and a child who had never acted before. (Hann-Byrd had been discovered in a regular school, not through an agency.) The good news about being 27 years old is youre pretty unconscious, and you dont think about how hard it is what youre undertaking, she said. View this image  Foster Orion Pictures Corp/Courtesy Everett Collection Foster certainly had her own abundant experiences with directors as a child to guide her especially on what not to do. There were lots of directors that worked with me that annoyed me, so I tried to avoid those techniques, she said. Later, she added: Theres nothing that I love more than a director who knows what they want. But I especially didnt want to be manipulated or bullied. And bad things happen to me when Im bullied or manipulated. Its the one area where I really rebel, and my way of rebellion is I just get cold. I get cold and totally unemotional and I will not act. Freds story was particularly important to Foster. Though Dede, a single parent, is devoted to him, Fred is not thriving in public school, nor does he have any friends (his greatest desire). When a school for gifted children discovers Fred who excels both at math and in the arts Dede becomes competitive with Jane (Dianne Wiest), the condescending, socially inept head of the school. Their dynamic hurts Fred, but by the movies end, Dede and Jane find a balance that serves both his mind and heart. Its a warm, sweet, intimate film that Roger Ebert described as the kind of movie you enjoy watching; its about interesting people finding out about themselves. Foster saw her own past dilemmas in the arc of Little Man Tate. Its a personal movie even though it was written by somebody else; I feel like its an auteur film, she said. I really saw myself as somebody who was pulled in two different directions, Foster continued, describing her bifurcated childhood. I had this weird emotional intelligence about people, and why they do what they do and trying to figure out how to help take care of people. But I also really felt great joy, and lived in the world of my intellect. Though Little Man Tate shows the audience some of Freds talents, theyre not the focus of the film his awkward, poignant attempts to fit into the world are. It was a deliberate choice of Fosters. Some of the criticism of the movie was, like, Wait a minute, this is a movie about a child genius: Why dont we talk about all the amazing things he does? Why dont we talk about his joy with math? she said. I was, like, Well, I was a prodigy, and I dont want to talk about that. I want to talk about how lonely I was. View this image  Dianne Wiest, Hann-Byrd, Foster. Orion Pictures Corp/Courtesy Everett Collection But Foster is also critical of her directing work. With Wiest, she said, she tried to control her performance too much. Jane, a brilliant snob who begins to discover her maternal side with Fred, was a different sort of role for Wiest, who had played spaced-out, warm-hearted characters in Footloose, Hannah and Her Sisters, and Parenthood. She has this beautiful, kind of bubbling way about her where she kind of discovers the lines in the moment, Foster said of Wiest and that couldnt be the case with Jane. I forced Dianne to be so meticulous and so rigid, and I know it wasnt her instinct, said Foster. And I still feel bad about it. But I think its a great performance. Nevertheless, she said, I always apologize every time I see her. Though Foster said the movie was nave, very plodding and black and white, and that she made her points in a big way, shes still proud of her directorial debut. I think more than anything else, it just has a lot of heart, Foster said. And mostly because it came from a really personal place: the theme of being alone, and knowing that youre different, and knowing that youre never going to belong, and youre never going to be like everybody else. I think that was a theme in my life as a young person. It is as I grew up. And I was just starting to understand that then. Home for the Holidays (1995) View this image  Holly Hunter, Robert Downey Jr. Paramount/Courtesy Everett Collection After directing Little Man Tate as well as winning that second Best Actress Oscar for The Silence of the Lambs Foster formed a production company, Egg, and entered into a deal with PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, a studio that eventually merged with Universal. Failed moguldom! she said with a loud laugh. I was following a path, and I cant say I think it was a mistake? But it was a lot of energy output, and I think the energy would have been better spent in other places. When youre young, you try things. She added: I think people thought I wanted to make big, mainstream movies, and the truth is I didnt. I just wanted to make movies that were relevant to me. Nell in 1994 was the first film that Foster and Egg produced, and it was set to be released just as she began to prepare to direct her next feature, Home for the Holidays, a drama/comedy about one loud, messy familys Thanksgiving weekend. Foster developed and starred in Nell, in addition to producing. It was an immersive performance, with Foster playing the title role of a young woman who had lived in isolation with her mother and created her own language before being discovered by doctors. Nell was tough, she said. People did not respond to the movie, they didnt like the movie. And I was really out there. I really put everything on the line. Foster would go on to be nominated for Best Actress again for Nell, but as she absorbed the criticism of the movie, she dove into Home for the Holidays. It was a good way of curing the ills of an unsuccessful movie, she said. Foster had bought Home for the Holidays after another company decided not to make it. It was based on a short story by Chris Radant, and she would be only behind the camera this time: no acting. View this image  From left: Steve Guttenberg, Charles Durning, Anne Bancroft, Cynthia Stevenson, Dylan McDermott, and Hunter. Paramount The film stars Holly Hunter as Claudia, an art restorer in Chicago who is fired from her museum job just as she is about to head to her parents house for Thanksgiving. Once there, she is infantilized if lovingly by her eccentric parents, played by Anne Bancroft and Charles Durning. It was a large ensemble: The cast also included Robert Downey Jr. as Tommy, Claudias charismatic, mercurial, gay brother; Dylan McDermott as Tommys friend and Claudias love interest; Cynthia Stevenson as Joanne, Claudia and Tommys sourpuss sister; Claire Danes as Claudias sophisticated teenage daughter; and various other family members of all embarrassing stripes. With this crowd, the script ended up changing significantly during the rehearsal period before the movie began shooting, and Foster worked closely with screenwriter W.D. Richter (The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension). So much of the overlapping dialogue and their dynamic with each other was really important, mostly for shaping the screenplay, Foster said. At this late stage, as the actors, Richter, and Foster workshopped the script, the focus of the movie became the warm relationship between Claudia and Tommy. Hunter, Foster said, loved to react to other people. And so, it was about engineering things for Holly to react to she was the person reacting to all this craziness around her. View this image  Downey Paramount Downey was in his wild-man days then, and was steps away from going into rehab (one of many times in the years to come). Yet the open process during Home for the Holidays served his talents well. He really fleshed out that character in a way that I wouldnt have been able to, Foster said. In her and Downeys hands, Tommy ended up being one of the most fully developed, realistic LGBT characters popular culture had yet seen: He is the object of his parents silent homophobia, and of his sister Joannes more vicious strain, but he has found joy in his home life with his husband Home for the Holidays features one of the first same-sex weddings in film. (Foster came out of her own glass closet in 2013 at the Golden Globe Awards.) Hes a verbal guy who can live performatively on the outside of his body, Foster said of Downey and the creation of Tommy. But theres also such pain in that character, knowing that hell never really be able to talk to his father, and that his mother is busy ignoring who he really is. The only person he connects to is his sister, mostly because shes an outsider as well. And they will forever be eating Thanksgiving dinner alone in the kitchen without everybody else there. The Beaver (2011) View this image  Mel Gibson Summit Entertainment Foster would not direct again for years, but she certainly tried: Flora Plum, a drama set in a 1930s circus, was first announced in 1999 and was to film the next year, starring Danes and Russell Crowe. But it was scrapped after Crowe injured himself right before shooting began, and Fosters subsequent efforts to get the movie going again did not work. As recently as 2008, she thought she still yearned to do it until she realized that she actually didnt. That was many years of my life, she said. And that was just a testament to a bad part of my personality too that I cant let things go, and I just keep banging myself against a wall over and over and over again! To the point where, 10 years down the line, I get that movie financed I finally get that movie financed, again, for the third time and Im about to get to the point where theyre dropping the money into the escrow. And I go, like, Wait a minute. I feel like I already made this movie. I feel like I grew out of this movie now! Between Home for the Holidays and The Beaver, Foster also had two sons, who are now in their teens. I was really present for their lives, she said. And maybe because Im so focused overly, hyperfocused on one thing I think I was scared of leaving them, and focusing on that other thing. She continued: And I cant regret that. I dont regret that I was there every single day for every single thing that they did. And acting allowed me to do that. I couldnt do that being a director. During the 2000s, she was in such movies as David Finchers Panic Room (2002), Spike Lees Inside Man (2006), and more but the acting lessened too. I burned out a little, Foster said. Im not going to be one of those actors whos like, Oh, yeah, Im only going to give you five days, and we cant work past 5, and my kids going to be in my trailer. I only shoot in L.A. Thats not going to be me! Im going to commit 100%. Otherwise, I dont know how to be good. It means that I only did one movie every three years. Despite knowing why she made the choices she did, and what she was doing instead, Foster said she feels bad about how rarely she has directed. Thats a big failure in my life, you know? she said. I cant believe that Ive directed so little, and Ive been in the business for so long, and I did my first movie when I was 27. View this image  Riley Thomas Stewart and Gibson. Summit Entertainment The Beaver by Kyle Killen was on the 2008 Black List, Franklin Leonards annual survey of the most popular unproduced screenplays (as picked by Hollywood executives). It was the story of a depressed CEO named Walter Black whose breakdown is so acute that he is revived only when he begins speaking through a beaver puppet he wears on his hand. Before Foster signed on to direct, it was geared to be more of a comedy, and Steve Carell was set to star in it. Foster did not see The Beaver that way. That was a very strong choice that I made that I know was not for everybody, she said. The movie that I loved was the drama about a man whos so broken and hates himself so much that he has to put a puppet on his hand in order to figure out how to survive. I wanted the darkness of it, and I wanted the emptiness of it to reflect who he was. I wanted it to be a film about mental illness. Foster wanted Mel Gibson her good friend, with whom she had starred in 1994s Maverick to play Walter. Gibsons anti-Semitic outburst during a 2006 DUI arrest had put him on the fringes of the entertainment industry; and even before that, he had not starred in a movie since 2002s Signs. But he was Fosters first choice. He knows how to do comedy, and he has a light touch and hes lovable. But he would really understand this movie from its darkest place. And thats really what I wanted to push him to do, she said. Despite not liking acting in the films she directs, she cast herself as Walters estranged wife, Meredith. I wanted to know that the person playing opposite him was going to honor the performance that he was giving and was going to be believable, and had the strength to stand opposite Mel Gibson, she said. Anton Yelchin played Porter, their high schoolage son who despises Walter, and Riley Thomas Stewart was cast as Henry, their younger kid, who loves Walter and yearns for his attention. View this image  Jennifer Lawrence Summit Entertainment Foster had difficulty finding someone to play Norah, Porters love interest, until she came across Jennifer Lawrences casting tape. It was 2009, and Lawrence would break out in Winters Bone the next year, but at that point, she had mostly been on television. Foster called her audition extraordinary, and it in fact made her realize that the character had been written wrong. On paper, Norah was the class valedictorian and a cheerleader and shes got all this banter, Foster said. And youre, like, Who is that? I mean, who in the world is that! Thats just some male fantasy. And it was weird having this one actress play all these perfect things it was annoying, actually. Foster went back to the script to write it for Lawrence. I made her less verbal, she said. Shes best when shes unconscious, when shes not an intellectual. So I took all of the Woody Allen out of the character. Toward the end of the movie, Walter feels so trapped by the beaver even though it has brought him back to himself and his family, and has made him a success in business again that he cuts his arm off, and barely survives. I wanted it to be moving, and I wanted to get to the end of the movie and understand why he had to cut his arm off, she said. The tone of the movie, deeply sad, yet also funny and hopeful, was difficult to strike. How did she do it on a daily basis? I dont know. Imperfectly. And Im sure lots of people would say I did a terrible job, Foster said. The Beaver might have been a tough sell for audiences under any circumstances, but it turned out not to matter. As Foster was doing reshoots in 2010 to prepare for its fall release where it would have been positioned as an Oscar movie, Gibson told her that tapes of him screaming at his ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva were going to come out soon. In the tapes, published by RadarOnline, Gibson admitted to hitting Grigorieva while she held their child, threatened her, and used vile epithets throughout. The Beaver no longer stood a chance with mainstream audiences. View this image  Foster and Gibson. Summit Entertainment/Courtesy Everett Collection Foster, who has remained friends with Gibson and strenuously defended him over the years, said her first reaction to the tapes was that Summit, the studio behind The Beaver, would just shelve the movie and it wouldnt come out. Instead, the film was delayed: It premiered at the SXSW Film Festival in March 2011, and then opened in limited release two months later. According to Box Office Mojo, it grossed less than $1 million domestically, with an additional $5.4 million worldwide, on a budget of $21 million. Yet in what might be the most unexpected bright side of all time, Foster said, Once the studio knew that they had a limited release and they were never going to be able to release the movie well anyway, they left me completely alone. Yeah, whatever score you want! Gibsons meltdown had destroyed what would have been an attempt at a comeback for him, as well as a probable push for a Best Actor nomination for his layered, tragic performance. But, Foster said, I actually got to make the movie I wanted to make. And that is reward in itself. I won the big prize. And I got such an extraordinary performance out of him. And I have a DVD. The Beaver was the final chapter in what Foster thinks of as sort of a trilogy her autobiographical first three movies. Early years as a prodigy, middle years of being torn with your family and trying to figure out who you are, and then that middle-age crisis, she said. She has spoken in the past about depression being a part of her life, and yes, The Beaver reflected that. A spiritual crisis, and the creativity that comes from a spiritual crisis. That was such a big part of my life, and I had a lot to say about that, Foster said. As an allegory, that film was totally me. And he is reborn at the end of the film, she continued. He has to become a new person that is a small, frail, not very grand person thats missing an arm in order to reconnect and remember who he was. And remember his relationships. Orange Is the New Black (2013 and 2014) and House of Cards (2014) View this image  Laverne Cox on Orange Is the New Black. Netflix In recent years, Foster has directed three episodes of television for Netflix and she really likes it. Its just a way of keeping your hand in, she said. I like serving a creator, and going, You do a thriller? Great, I can do a thriller. Because Ive done all kinds of movies, so its easy for me to go back and forth and to honor their system. Having worked with Fincher on Panic Room, for instance, Foster felt confident that she knew what he would want visually for a Season 2 episode of House of Cards. She directed Chapter 22, in which the Underwoods ascent is threatened by Claires affair being exposed; it was also the episode in which Francis had to cut ties with Freddy, his favorite barbecue artist. When you work for David Fincher, you know its all prime lenses, she said. And there will be no red! You know what the template is, and I love serving that template. Both of the Orange Is the New Black episodes she directed were pivotal for the series. The second one, Thirsty Bird, was the Season 2 premiere in which Piper (Taylor Schilling), having beaten the shit out of Pennsatucky (Taryn Manning) in the first season finale, finds herself on a plane to what is eventually revealed to be a Chicago prison to testify in a trial. Viewers are meant to be as confused as Piper for awhile, and its disorienting: The only familiar faces in the episode are Schillings and Laura Prepons as Alex Vause. To do something with almost an entirely new cast, and, real sets, hardly any built sets at all, was like doing my own pilot, which was nice, Foster said. View this image  Netflix For Fosters first Orange Is the New Black episode Lesbian Request Denied, the third episode of Season 1 she was nominated for both a Directors Guild of America Award and an Emmy. Lesbian Request Denied made clear early in Orange Is the New Blacks life that, because of its portrayal of the varied, tragicomic world of American women in prison, it would be like nothing that has ever been on television before. The episode featured the backstory of Sophia (Laverne Cox), the transgender inmate who went from firefighter to convict as she paid for her transition through fraud. It was sad, moving, and surprising and the episodes humor came in the form of Suzanne Crazy Eyes Warrens (Uzo Aduba) relentless obsession with Piper. Chocolate and vanilla swirl, swirl, Suzanne sings to Piper, in a much-quoted and GIFd line. (I cast Crazy Eyes. I cast Uzo! said Foster.) With comedy-drama, it takes awhile to figure out what the tone of it is, Foster said of Orange Is the New Black. Thats what I do for a living, I do comedy-dramas. So I feel like they were finding their way a little bit, and that episode maybe kick-started them in a certain direction. And did Foster think it was funny that she of all people was directing an episode called Lesbian Request Denied? It was fantastic, Foster said. I laughed. It was almost as good as making a movie called The Beaver. Money Monster (2016) View this image  Clooney TriStar Pictures Money Monster is different from anything Foster has previously directed. Its a large-scale thriller with an explicitly political spine with major movie stars in the lead roles. She was attached to the project during the script stage, and liked that it was both a real thinking mans movie and a general public movie. Kyle has strapped a bomb on Lee, and has a gun pointed at him, but of course as the movie goes on, the audience sees that he is not only right about Lees character, but about the criminality of modern finance. And Lee, in turn, has a chance to be redeemed. Its commentary on the terrifying realities of the financial world resonated with Foster. Its so many layers and so much modern social relevance about whats going on today with entertainment and politics and finances and technology and how all those things are put together in this weird mishmash, she said. That being said, for me its really about these small character pieces, and the theater of these two men, and the woman thats producing their survival, she continued. And their dynamic and their relationship and how they change these two guys looking at failure. They start off thinking theyre the opposites, and yet they have so much in common. Because they hate themselves. (When it was pointed out to Foster that she had similarly extolled self-hatred in the Walter character in The Beaver, she said with a laugh, I do like that as a theme!) View this image  Roberts TriStar Pictures Filming the movie presented a number of technical challenges. It unfolds in slightly fudged real-time, and Patty is watching Lee and Kyle on monitors in the control room from which she produces the show. Foster said she realized as she prepared to shoot the movie that meant that all of the scenes on the set needed to be shot first and in sequence in order for Patty to talk to Lee through an earpiece, and to react to what is happening between him and Kyle. It also meant filming whats on the monitors themselves during Roberts scenes. And they all have to be correct; its not like we can change them, Foster said. Another logistical difficulty was that Roberts had only eight days available to film, so Foster had to use the actors time judiciously. Luckily, Roberts came prepared. I dont know whether shes pretending that its all effortless, and it doesnt take any energy at all and its all just fine, Foster said. She knows everything about television broadcasting, shes got every single line written down, she knows everyone elses lines, she knows which buttons shes pushing at what time. Shes got the whole thing worked out in the earpiece. Shes amazing. And then shes, you know, knitting and talking shit. Foster was also grateful to be able to rely on Roberts and Clooneys real-life camaraderie to make the PattyLee friendship believable it does, after all, provide Money Monsters emotional core. Shes sort of his Jiminy Cricket, Foster said. This virtual intimacy that they have is weirdly closer than if they were standing in the same room together. Theres that chemistry they have that I have nothing to do with, thats just like a god chemistry between the two of them, Foster continued. They finish each others sentences, and you just know theyre brother and sister. You cant manufacture that. View this image  Roberts and Foster. TriStar Pictures With its helicopters and police vans and hundreds of extras, Money Monster isnt the sort of film that is often directed by a woman. And the recent questions and criticisms about the lack of female directors in the mainstream entertainment industry is an issue on Fosters mind. Its been a prickly path, she said, especially once Hollywoods output became a global business. Theyre looking to keep their risks as small as possible, because theyve got a lot of risks on the line, Foster said of studio executives. And I guess women are risks. And as thats gone on, thats why its a less diverse canvas than its ever been in the mainstream movie industry. Even when studios have been run by women, it didnt change anything the lists were still the same when it came down to it, she said. Foster does feel that things are changing. But, she said, Its a complicated issue. The discussion is a little simple. And were not going to get there with quotas. You cant legislate how art is done, she added. And you also have to embrace the fact that men and women are different, that we lead differently, that we are interested in different things. For someone who literally grew up in Hollywood, it is an uncomfortable topic for Foster, who prizes loyalty so much. She is frank about the dilemma she feels. Its hard for me, she said, because these guys, these old guys those are the guys that gave me my opportunities, that believed in me, and that brought me up like their daughter. I was always surrounded by men. And I was surrounded by cigar-chomping sexist men, too. Who loved me! Who took care of me, and believed in me. So its hard. Its not my nature to be She paused. To kick anyone in the face. Of course she wants things to change, though, even if the process is slow. You cant go into an elevator without encountering sexism; its part of being a woman, Foster said. And I dont need to eradicate it in a way. I just need to be able to make small steps so we can change the culture little by little. View this image  Foster in The Silence of the Lambs. Orion Pictures Corp. Of course, she already has. She played a kickass tomboy in Freaky Friday; a rape survivor who wouldnt give up in The Accused; an FBI trainee who faced down a serial killer in The Silence of the Lambs; and an intrepid mother who would do anything to save her daughter in Panic Room. If those steps toward changing audiences perception of women once happened mostly in front of the camera, Foster is now focused on making a lasting impact as a director. I feel like my whole life has worked up to this. Yeah, Im a young director. Ive only done four movies, and I have a lot to learn, and Im excited about that, she said. Ill always act. But I want it to be special. Id like to try new things as an actor, and in order to do that, I cant burn out on doing the old things over and over. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

A few weeks before prom we went into the local tuxedo store and picked out what kind I wanted with Miya supporting me and leaving all the decisions up to me. It made me feel bomb AF knowing I looked better than all the boys there, especially when I had the prettiest date.

aS'The guidance is not legally binding, but it reinforces the administrations position that it will take legal action against violators. View this image  AP / Susan Walsh Amid a national debate over transgender peoples access to restrooms, the Obama administration sent guidelines to public schools on Friday saying they cannot discriminate against transgender students in a wide range of settings from restrooms to sports teams. When a school provides sex-segregated activities and facilities, transgender students must be allowed to participate in such activities and access such facilities consistent with their gender identity, says a copy of the letter obtained by BuzzFeed News. The rules apply to restrooms, locker rooms, sports teams, fraternities, sororities, housing, and more. According to the guidance, school officials cannot require that a transgender student provide identifying documents, such as a birth certificate, or undergo any form of medical validation to qualify. There is no medical diagnosis or treatment requirement that students must meet as a prerequisite to being treated consistent with their gender identity, says the letter to school administrators. It isnt the first time the Obama administration has asserted Title IX of the Education Act of 1972, which bans discrimination on the basis of sex, bans transgender discrimination as a form of sex discrimination. However, the guidance to be issued Friday by the Department of Education and Department of Justice is the strongest, most direct set of instructions to date that spells out the various settings schools should implement those standards across the country. Federal education guidelines apply to public districts serving K-12 students, public universities, and other education facilities receiving federal money. The guidance is not legally binding; however, it reinforces the administrations position that it will take legal action against violators. But several Republican governors resisted the guidance. Like Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, Utah Gov. Gary Herbert issued a statement calling the policy federal overreach. Herbert added, If we have to fight this order, we will not hesitate to do so. Opposition was even more blunt from Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant and Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who instructed state education officials to disregard the guidance. The Mississippi Department of Education should disregard the Obama administration\'s outrageous bathroom directive. As Gov., I recommend that school districts disregard @POTUS\'s guidance on gender identification in schools. >> https://t.co/mFxgtOcbml The Education Department did not immediately respond to BuzzFeed News request to comment on governors digging in their heels. In a statement issued Thursday, Catherine E. Lhamon, Department of Education Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights, had said, This guidance answers questions schools have been asking, with a goal to ensure that all students are treated equally consistent with their gender identity. LGBT advocates hailed the guidance. Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, said she was thrilled after some legislators and anti-trans extremists have been encouraging schools to deny transgender students basic educational opportunities by preying on baseless fears and cooking up confusion about what federal law requires. Meanwhile, the federal government is tangled in three lawsuits in North Carolina, where state officials have claimed transgender students pose a safety threat in restroom and locker rooms. The lawmakers there banned transgender people from using bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity in public schools. North Carolina governor Pat McCrory responded to the guidance in a statement on Friday saying that the executive branch is overreaching its authority. Now, both the federal courts and the U.S. Congress must intercede to stop this massive executive branch overreach, which clearly oversteps constitutional authority, McCrory wrote. Gov. McCrory says executive branch "does not have the authority to be the final arbiter" on bathrooms. #ncpol #HB2 Two sets of public officials sued the federal government last week, arguing Title IX does not include transgender protections, and that the laws scope must be resolved by federal courts. The Justice Department responded by suing state officials. For years, the Obama administration has ramped up its efforts to apply Title IX to transgender students. In 2013, education and justice department officials announced a settlement agreement that resolved a complaint filed on behalf of a transgender student who faced discrimination a California school district. The next year, federal officials issued guidance under Title IX that protects students on the basis of gender identity in cases of sexual violence. Since then, the agencies have advanced their Title IX interpretation by pushing several school districts into compliance. In courts again citing Title IX federal attorneys filed an amicus brief before the 4th Circuit Court in October backing a transgender boy trying to overturn a Virginia county school districts policy. The court found in April that the department enjoyed deference to apply Title IX that way. The guidance states that a school must not treat a transgender student differently from the way it treats other students of the same gender identity. The Departments interpretation is consistent with courts and other agencies interpretations of Federal laws prohibiting sex discrimination.

aS"Gov. Charlie Baker has indicated he will sign the bill into law, which would buck a trend of states attempting to restrict transgender rights. View this image  Gov. Charlie Baker, top left, and Senate President Stanley Rosenberg, center, with House Speaker Robert DeLeo. AP / Steven Senne The Massachusetts House on Wednesday joined the Senate in passing a bill that would protect transgender people in places of public accommodation including in restrooms that match their gender identity. While the House and Senate versions must be reconciled in a conference committee, the bill is now one step closer to the desk of Gov. Charlie Baker, who has indicated he plans to sign it into law. The bill also shows Massachusetts lawmakers willingness to diverge from several other states that advanced legislation this year to curtail transgender peoples access to restrooms. In the months before the vote, Democrats had argued the bill advanced basic civil rights for transgender people, and blocked several amendments from Republicans that would have weakened the legislation. It is our responsibility to advance these provisions when there is clearly evidence that transgender people can and are being discriminated against, Senate President Stanley Rosenberg, a Democrat, told BuzzFeed News. State lawmakers also overcame concerns that had held the bill back in years past, specifically, a fear that banning transgender discrimination in places of public accommodation would allow transgender sex predators to prowl womens restrooms. Conservative critics of LGBT rights have suggested men could abuse legal protections by simply claiming to be transgender. But House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo told reporters in May that he liked the bill as passed by a joint judiciary committee, suggesting he was prepared to bring the legislation to a floor vote. And Tuesday, Baker told the Boston Globe, If the House bill were to pass in its current form, yeah, I would sign it. However, the Republican governor was not always so outspoken. He was booed off stage in April after expressing ambivalence about the measure. Lizzy Guyton, a spokesman for Baker, told BuzzFeed News in a statement in May that the governor will carefully review a bill should the legislature act, adding that he believes no one should be discriminated against based on gender identity. The governor also supports existing state laws banning transgender discrimination in housing and employment, Guyton added. Those arguments provided the impetus for North Carolinas legislature to pass a law in March banning transgender people from using restrooms that match their gender identity in public buildings and schools. A law passed this year in Mississippi allows transgender people to be banned from restrooms based on religious objections. In North Dakota, the legislature passed a bill that restricted transgender people in schools this year, before the governor vetoed the bill, and in Tennessee, lawmakers advanced similar legislation. So what allows Massachusetts to zig while others zag? Massachusetts Senate Bill 735, along with its companion bill in the House, would ban discrimination on the basis of gender identity in places of public accommodation. In doing so, it would expand existing state laws that ban discrimination based on a wide range of characteristics including sexual orientation and race. It applies in all public businesses and venues, from transit facilities to restaurants. Protecting trans people in these public places has been the missing tooth in the states otherwise full row of LGBT protections. It is a glaring omission right now, Sonia Chang-Daz, the bills prime senate sponsor, told BuzzFeed News. She said that unfounded fears about bathrooms had held back the protections from a 2011 bill to protect transgender people in housing and employment. Chang-Daz said lawmakers appear ready to fill in the last gap after transgender advocates and individuals have come up, person by person, to tell their story to make this issue real for legislators who are not familiar with them. Concerns about bathrooms are red herring, noting that violence and discrimination against transgender people is well studied, she added. In the 17 states and 225 cities with similar protections for gender identity in places of public accommodation, there are no documented examples of the laws being used by transgender people or those posing as transgender for nefarious purposes in restrooms or locker rooms. In contrast, according to a 2013 study by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, 70% of survey respondents reported being denied access, verbally harassed, or physically assaulted in public restrooms. Meanwhile, research conducted by Massachusetts-based 2014 Fenway Health shows 65% of transgender people reported discrimination in public accommodation settings in the previous year. Freedom for All Americans, a founding partner of Freedom Massachusetts, which advocates for the bills passage, said in a statement that state senators set a high bar for the rest of the nation on what being a champion for LGBT equality looks like. The House version of the bill would require that the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination create rules to prevent abuse essentially, ensuring that people do not claim to be transgender for unlawful purposes. The state attorney generals office, meanwhile, would need provide guidance for law enforcement dealing with anyone who asserts gender identity for an improper purpose. The senate had rejected similar amendments. Before the Senate vote, Rosenberg had said those regulations were unnecessary, but added that they address a set of fears that are actually just that theyre fears as opposed to evidence of problem.

aS'You say it best when you say nothing at all. View this image  Stefan Postles / Getty Images The GLORIAs, an acronym for the unwieldy Gay and Lesbian Outrageous, Ridiculous and Ignorant comment Awards, is an annual event organised by NSW Labor MLC Penny Sharpe. Mock awards are handed out to the people who made the most offensive comments about LGBT people, as voted by members of the community. This year, 60 nominations were whittled down to 32 for the colourful night, hosted by Melbourne comedian, Kirsty Webeck, with entertainment from Sydney drag queen, Barbara Blacksheep. #TheGLORIAs halftime show. Complete with "Gloria" lipsync. In February, Turnbull failed to condemn comments made by backbencher MP George Christensen likening the Safe Schools Coalition to paedophile grooming, calling for all parties to use measured language instead. Since Christensens comments, anti-marriage equality groups have increasingly adopted rhetoric that compares the Safe Schools Coalition and the LGBT community in general to paedophiles. Can\'t remember exact saying, but bad stuff happens when good men do nothing. Turnbull would do well to remember this. #TheGlorias Rubio took out the International category for comments made in 2006 describing gay adoption as a social experiment. Rubio declined to address the comments when they arose in the media after he announced his presidential run last year. The Media GLORIA went to 2CHs Kel Richards for describing the Safe Schools Coalition as disgusting gay and lesbian propaganda, while Shelton took out the Religion category for saying on Sky News that he worries people might think he is gay if same-sex marriage becomes legal. Pacquiaos comments describing same-sex couples as worse than animals won him the coveted Sports award. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Loretta Lynch compared historic racial segregation of bathrooms to the anti-transgender bathroom law in North Carolina. CNN North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory on Wednesday tried to turn the tables on the federal governments top prosecutor, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, by saying her comparison of Jim Crow segregation to his states law banning transgender people from certain bathrooms was an insult. Its an insult, and its a political statement instead of a legal statement, the governor said on CNN, referring to comments that Lynch delivered while announcing a federal civil rights lawsuit against McCrory and other state officials on Monday. Lynch had invoked policies used to ban people of color from certain public spaces in a speech that alleged illegal discrimination against transgender people in North Carolina. It was not so very long ago that states, including North Carolina, had signs above restrooms, water fountains and on public accommodations keeping people out based upon a distinction without a difference, she said. But McCrory rebutted Wednesday, Whether a boy can go into girls restroom to correlate that to the civil rights movement is totally irresponsible for the chief legal officer of the United States of America. The North Carolina law bans transgender people from using restrooms that align with their gender identity in government-run buildings and schools. The Justice Department warned the state last week that the law violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bans discrimination on the basis of sex in the workplace. McCrory in turn sued the Justice Department, asking a federal court to clarify the civil rights laws scope. But in a rejoinder, Lynch filed the U.S. governments own suit against McCrory and other state officials. Speaking to CNNs Jake Tapper, McCrory blamed liberals for creating a national political debate when the the Charlotte City Council passed an LGBT nondiscrimination ordinance in spring. State officials not only nullified the policy by passing House Bill 2, they went further by also adding new state regulations for bathrooms. North Carolina has, for whatever reason, become the target of the left on this issue, he said. This is an agenda of the far left. Despite the Justice Departments position since 2014, McCrory also asserted on Wednesday that federal officials were imposing new rules this month banning transgender discrimination under Title VII. This is a new, sensitive issue for people on all sides, he said, adding, Now the Justice Department is making a civil-rights claim that every employer and every university must have gender expression and gender identity for bathrooms. To have the Justice Department come out with a massive interpretation of the Civil Rights Act for every employer is something that I think needs clarification from the federal courts. However, the Justice Departments argument is not new to North Carolina. In December 2014, Attorney General Eric Holder announced this was the governments position going forward in employment litigation. I have determined that the best reading of Title VIIs prohibition of sex discrimination is that it encompasses discrimination based on gender identity, including transgender status, Attorney General Eric Holder wrote at the time. Saying that he was asking courts for clarity, McCrory added, we will follow the law. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The bill will end Italys status as the only country in Western Europe with no legal protections for same-sex couples. View this image  Tiziana Fabi / AFP / Getty Images The lower house of Italys Parliament voted overwhelmingly to enact a bill to create a civil union status for same-sex couples on Wednesday, La Repubblica reported, a vote that will end Italys status as the last country in Western Europe that provides no legal recognition for gay and lesbian relationships. The Senate endorsed the legislation after a bitter debate in February in a vote that Prime Minister Matteo Renzi secured after agreeing to cut key provisions from the bill. The most significant was dropping a section that would have allowed for adopting a partners child, which a coalition of LGBT rights groups condemned as a deep betrayal. The path in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, was smoother thanks to Renzis Democratic Party holds a much larger majority. The bill was adopted by a vote of 372 to 51 with 99 abstentions on Wednesday evening. Italy has long lagged its peers in offering protections for same-sex couples; every large EU member state in Western Europe except Germany has established full marriage equality, and Germany has long provided for a partnership status with similar legal benefits. The Italian Supreme Court and Europes top human rights court have both ruled Italy must adopt such legislation, but lawmakers could not summon the votes in parliament. LGBT rights advocates vowed after passage of the Senate version that they would return to the courts to challenge gaps in protections between the new legislation and marriage. Though polls have shown nearly half of Italians support marriage equality and an overwhelming majority of Italians support some form of legal protections, the hard road to passage reflects the continued influence of the conservative Catholic hierarchy in Italian politics.

aS"Chuck Hughes, a board member who voted to allow pepper spray on campus citing bathroom bill concerns, told BuzzFeed News that he will now vote to put it back on the prohibited items list. View this image  Supporters of House Bill 2 at a rally at the North Carolina State Capitol in Raleigh, N.C. Gerry Broome / AP A school board in North Carolina, which voted to adopt a policy allowing pepper sprays in high schools, is now rethinking its decision after feedback from the community, a board member told BuzzFeed News Wednesday. The Rowan-Salisbury Board voted Monday to amend its policy prohibiting high school students from carrying pepper sprays on campus, the Salisbury Post first reported. However, Chuck Hughes, a board member who voted in favor of the policy, told BuzzFeed News he will personally vote against it in the next session on May 23, after he realized that the cons far outweighed the pros. He also said that many board members he had talked to will think this over again. During Mondays session, Hughes was reported to come out in favor of allowing sprays citing HB2 concerns. According to the Salisbury Post, he said, Depending on how the courts rule on the bathroom issues, it may be a pretty valuable tool to have on the female students if they go to the bathroom, not knowing who may come in. Hughes backtracked Wednesday, telling BuzzFeed News that his comments were inappropriate and that they had nothing do with the LGBT community. I was not thinking about the LGBT issue, Hughes said. Perverts and pedophiles taking advantage of this law in bathrooms was my major concern. North Carolina and the Department of Justice have sued each other over House Bill 2 (HB2), which was passed into law in March and bans transgender people access to restrooms that match their gender identity in government buildings and schools. The law has sparked protests and several companies and performers have refused to work in North Carolina. Hughes said he thought of pepper sprays as a defensive tool when he voted to allow it on campuses but he realized it could also be misused by students. The LGBT issue has never been a problem to my knowledge, Hughes said. People have a different sexual identity, they go about their business. You dont even know that a transgender is in your bathroom. Theyre not there to create havoc. But perverts are. Hughes said he was not homophobic and that the LGBT community had rights to be protected. Theyre not the ones to look out for, he said. My statement was misinterpreted and when I hear other people talking about it, I can see how it was misinterpreted. He said he could see teenage boys pretending that their gender identity was female to enter bathrooms as a joke. He said that after hearing the negatives from the community on allowing students to carry pepper sprays, the cons outweighed the pros and that he put more faith in teens than perhaps I should have. Hughes said the board had the opportunity to hear from the community and would take their feedback into consideration during their next session where they will vote on the policy after a second reading. Were a strong board and were going to reevaluate this and maybe change it, Hughes said. I personally will vote to put pepper spray back into the prohibited items list along with razor blades, guns, knives, and other items that are not okay to take on school campuses.

aS"Heres a first look at the unique resource. View this image  Maya Newell She did rowing at school, and had two dads and a mum, and every week, right up until Year 10, she would ask her dad to stand on the other side of the river, separate to where the other parents would watch, because she didnt feel comfortable being out at school, Newell said. After hearing a teacher stop a student from saying Thats so gay, it occurred to Kate for the first time that people at school might actually be supportive of her family. It wasnt until that moment that she felt she could do this at school and it wouldnt be a big deal. She remembers the moment in their family when she asked her dad to stand on the other side of the bank with everyone else, said Newell. View this image  The poster distributed to Australian schools.

Lets face it, launching an education resource when your film is banned during school hours is problematic, she said. So we had to rectify that situation, and Im proud to say the department of education is really supportive of the resource. The Victorian government has publicly lent its support to the School Action Toolkit. The NSW department of education issued a statement to BuzzFeed News stating they do not endorse externally produced resources.

aS"From height to receding hairlines. View this image  Do a quick Google image search for wedding weight loss, for example, and the results will be 99% female. The photos show women in lace wedding dresses with measuring tapes around their waists; before and after photos of ladies proudly showing off all the spare fabric their pre-wedding diets gave them. Setting aside the pressure this puts on women who, I dont know, maybe just want to get married and be happy, it creates a vacuum for men who might be grappling with body image issues of their own. When I put out a call for men to share via the BuzzFeed Community how they were affected by their their body insecurities before and during their weddings, I received dozens of responses. Men, it turns out, deal with a lot weight, height, hair loss, too much hair, excess sweat but rarely have the space to discuss it, or even feel that theyre not alone. Here are three of their stories. View this image  Paul and his wife, Nicole, got married in February 2015 after dating for five years. Paul hoped to lose weight before his wedding. How has your weight affected you throughout your life? Im about 511 and Ive always fluctuated around 250 pounds, plus or minus 20 pounds. Its only bothered me in the same way itd bother anyone youre much harder on yourself than anybody else is. Especially in high school and in early college, it affected my confidence in approaching any romantic interest. As you get older, you realize that weight isnt all that there is to people. Especially after I graduated from undergrad, I became more accepting of who I was at that time. Its good to strive for improvement, but you have to have self-respect and acceptance for yourself. I met my wife just after I finished my first year of law school. How did your concerns about your weight affect you as you prepared for your wedding? The joke after I got engaged was about me going on a wedding diet. Even when we went shopping for the engagement ring, the joke in the background was like, Whens the diet going to start? When you get married, all you do is open yourself up to unsolicited advice from people about everything. I guess it didnt bother me because as a guy, youre exposed to things like King of Queens you know, the guy is a fat, funny slob with a hot, young wife. The trope that it doesnt matter what guys look like because no one cares is everywhere. Even the dadbod trend was about embracing that whole mentality. The whole thing is really, really strange. It wasnt too worried about losing weight, but I wanted to look the best I could for my wedding day, because those are the pictures everyone looks at. I used apps like Fitbit to figure out what I was eating, what my target would be. By the wedding, Id lost 57 pounds. As the wedding approached, the anxiety would increase that I wasnt making it a priority. At the three-month mark, I realized some massive change wasnt going to occur, so it became more about feeling good than hitting a number I thought would look good. Abbey Moore Photography / Via abbeymoore.net Abbey Moore Photography / Via abbeymoore.net How did you feel about it on your wedding day? Im very pleased with how everything turned out. I dont remember much from the wedding; it was a blur. On the day itself, I wasnt bemoaning that I shouldve lost more weight. I was just in the moment, so it didnt bother me too much. The pictures look good, I felt good, and now I look back and I feel good about it How tight does my jacket look? was not anywhere on that list. Sure, in some photos, I look and think, Thats not a great angle, but not every photo is going to be a pleasant one. I dont think anyone is 100% happy with the all of the pictures taken of them. How do you think men experience body image issues differently than women? Body image issues are the same for weddings as they are in general there are mass-produced, heavily sexualized [images of] women in advertisements for everything. Wedding magazines and everything make women think they should look that way when they get married, too. Men are kind of told it doesnt matter how you look, as long as youre funny or have a hot wife. Men dont really talk about anything thats important. Male friendships are predicated on different experiences than female relationships are; men dont turn to each other for emotional support. When it came to wedding stuff, my guy friends and I only talked about the bachelor party, and if I were to bring up my weight, it would be about losing it in general, not for the wedding. I didnt feel alone or anything I had support from my fianc and my family when I was trying to lose weight but I think men should be more open to speaking to each other about anything. View this image  Trevor and his wife, Karen, married in August 2012 after five years together. Trevor was self-conscious about his receding hairline before their wedding. When did you first notice you were losing your hair? Karen and I met on Halloween of 2007, and I noticed that I was losing my hair right around the time that we met. I used to get a regular short and tight haircut once or twice a year and then grow it out to your standard young skater punk long hair flop. And then every time I got it cut short I started to notice that it took longer and longer for the front part to grow back, and it was coming back thinner every time. It was a huge bummer, especially because I wasnt even 30 yet. I loved being able to grow my hair longer, I felt so cool. I tried for a little while to do buzz cuts but I have a funky-shaped head so I wasnt really feeling it. How did your concerns about your hairline affect you as you prepared for your wedding? I thought about it a lot right from the beginning of our engagement. I mean, I cant speak for all dudes, but I personally had put a fair amount of thought into what my wedding would be like as I grew up. I never pictured me being balding. This is gonna sound lame, but I always pictured an Uncle Jesse from Full House when he married Aunt Becky type of hair situation. I considered going back to the buzz cut but again, I hate the way my bare head looks. I also considered trying Rogaine or something, but that stuff is expensive and Ive always heard such mixed reviews about how well it works. View this image  How did you feel about it on your wedding day? Honestly, it crossed my mind when I was getting ready and then I didnt think about it one time the rest of the day. There is so much happening on your wedding day, especially if you have a bigger wedding (I think we had around 150 guests) that all of the smaller things kind of fall by the wayside. I just didnt have time to think about it. In terms of the love I felt, and the love I was feeling for my gorgeous bride that day, it affected me none. Sometimes when I look at our wedding pictures I cringe a little about it, and its still an issue that I have. But whaddayagonnado, amiright? Has any of this affected your relationship with your wife? Shes always been super kind about it and always says Im being silly and its not that bad. Which is nice to hear, but you know when you get an idea in your head regarding something you dont like about your appearance? It can be hard for others to convince you otherwise. It really sucks that we, as a society, put such an unrealistic picture of what it is to be good-looking out there. Like I mentioned my lame Full House comparison, I used to have [that idea in] my head. Well, I am no John Stamos, that is for sure. But damn it, I dont need to be. Im Trevor fucking Dunham and thats all I need to be. And it seems to be good enough for my wife. View this image  Alex and his wife Christy got married in March 2016. Alex is 50, and his wife is 53. How has your height affected you throughout your life? Most of the women I have dated have been much taller than I am, usually around 56 or 57. I was always extremely self-conscious. It made me feel weak. To me, it felt like people I dated would be overprotective of me, like they were thinking, Hey, I have to protect the small one. Thats OK sometimes, but not all the time. Thats not how I felt inside, so that was very frustrating for me. I am strong even though I am small. Christy and I met about a year and a half ago. I was speaking at a LGBT conference at the University of Utah. She was attending a class I was speaking in, and we talked afterwards and formed a friendship. As time went on, we acknowledged our connection, which was really special. Alex, who is transgender, started transitioning in November 2011. Before I transitioned, I was insecure about everything about my body; everything I felt was much more intense. Growing up assigned female, it was still hard to be as short as I am. I wanted to hang out with the guys, but I always felt less than. I got shoved into a locker in high school because I fit inside it. I liked playing basketball, but I never got picked because I was small. It felt like my height always put me at a disadvantage. When I decided to transition, it was hard. In the guy world, there are alpha dogs, the super manly ones. I wondered where I would fit in, and I was nervous. I am very, very short in the guy world. As I transitioned, though, it changed. I have become much more secure and confident now that I feel like my soul and body are connected. It is so much easier to get through. It isnt always about height anymore; I have bigger things to worry about. Still, I do sometimes feel insecure about it. When youre smaller than your wife is, people look at that. As Ive transitioned, I get the short jokes from guys. I get roused about it, but I take it all in good fun. Alex Florence Alex Florence How did your concerns about your height affect you as you prepared for your wedding? I was pretty conscious of it for a few reasons. You look at the magazines and see tuxes on 6-foot-tall model guys with big biceps. I knew I wasnt going to look like that. I thought, Am I going to look like a squat guy in their dads suit? Are people going to think its too big? Or that I really found something that worked for me? I will always have to get things tailored so that theyre not too long, but I was concerned that my suit wasnt going to come out right. I wondered if I was going to look like I have broad shoulders, with that V-shape look from the shoulders down. How did you feel about it on your wedding day? I was conscious about everything up to the moment the wedding happened, and at that moment, I was like, Eh, whatever. Up to the day we were getting married, I was like, Am I going to look short? Shes going to be wearing heels. She did buy heels, but she ended up taking them off because she knew it was something that made me feel, for that moment, less masculine. During the wedding, I was wondering if I I looked handsome in my suit, if it fit the way it should fit a guy. You know, straight down in the hips, with broad enough shoulders. Once I saw some of the candid pics, I was like, Damn, I look handsome! It looks so much better than what was in my head! Thats what I was going for! I was really happy about it. A lot of people complimented me on my suit, and I looked nice. I cleaned up well. Im small, but I worked it. I looked like I felt really confident and thats what I wanted, thats what I hoped for. How does your height affect your relationship with your wife? Shes very conscious of my feelings; she helps me feel better when I have dysphoric feelings, like if I look guy-ish or not. When we first started dating, she wore flat shoes a lot, but our height difference isnt super noticeable shes only three inches taller than I am. Discussing my height wasnt the first thing we talked about, but after a while, I told her I feel smaller sometimes, especially when people asked if I was her son. Shes older than I am (even though she doesnt look it), and I look younger than my age, but I thought that was happening because I look short. Now shell do things like walk on the lower part of the slope when were walking so our height is even, or hold me tighter when there are bigger guys around. She says, I love you, and nothing about you embarrasses me at all. How do you think men experience body image issues differently than women? Ive learned that in guy world, you dont talk about your feelings. With weddings, everyone goes through their own stress. I thought that when I transitioned, my body image issues would go away, but they just transferred somewhere else. The media says I should have a six-pack and look a certain way, and I have to be secure with the fact that I never will. Height-wise, this is something I cant change. I have to accept it. Im going to have bad days or moments. On your wedding day, you have to be secure and focus on whats important youre marrying the love of your life.

aS"Wed barely had time to relax in the safety of being a legal family when our own legislature sucker-punched us, one of the women fighting the new Mississippi law tells BuzzFeed News. View this image  Joce Pritchett and Carla Webb, who live in Mississippi, married in Maine in 2013. Mississippi is facing a new challenge to its law that allows state officials to recuse themselves from authorizing same-sex marriages. The same lawyers who challenged Mississippis marriage ban on behalf of a pair of same-sex couples were back in federal court on Tuesday, asking a federal judge to limit the effect of Mississippis new anti-LGBT religious refusal law on same-sex couples. [T]here can be no such thing as separate, but (un)equal marriage for gay and lesbian couples in Mississippi, the lawyers write in Tuesdays filing. The Supreme Court could not have been clearer about this when it said in Obergefell that states must allow same-sex couples to marry on the same terms and conditions as all other couples. The effort led by Roberta Kaplan who represented Edith Windsor in her successful challenge to the Defense of Marriage Act addresses only one provision of HB 1523, which was signed into law by Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant earlier this year: the recusal provision. The move stands in contrast to the more broad challenge the ACLU filed to on Monday, in which the organization is asking a federal judge to stop the entire new law from going into effect at all. The recusal provision being addressed in Tuesdays filing allows government officials who have the authority to authorize or license marriages to recuse themselves from doing so for same-sex couples based on sincerely held religious beliefs, so long as those who wish to recuse themselves provide notice to the State Registrar of Vital Records of the Mississippi Department of Health. While HB 1523 states that the authorization and licensing of any legally valid marriage [shall] not [be] impeded or delayed as a result of any recusal, the motion states, it leaves the manner of doing so completely up to the person who recused him or herself, and provides no enforcement mechanism for making sure that there is no delay or impediment. For the Campaign for Southern Equality and the two same-sex couples who had sued to end the marriage ban in the first place, the new law HB 1523 was a slap in the face, as Joce Pritchett, one of the plaintiffs told BuzzFeed News. Wed barely had time to relax in the safety of being a legal family when our own legislature sucker-punched us, Pritchett wrote. These are the people we elected to protect us. To say that county clerks can choose not to issue us licenses but continue to issue licenses to straight couples in line behind us is incredibly unfair. And so, on Tuesday, lawyers for the couples and the organization asked the judge in their marriage case to reopen that case to expand the permanent injunction he issued last year against Mississippis marriage ban. The lawyers explain in the filing that they are pursuing this unusual path to challenging HB 1523 because the new law once again seeks to limit the access of gay and lesbian Mississippians to the institution of marriage on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples. After Bryant signed the bill into law, Kaplan sought information from the Department of Health about how they would enforce the recusal provision. An attorney for the Department of Health told Kaplan in a letter dated May 4, The Office of Vital Records is not an agent, officer, subsidiary, or employee of the only parties to [this] lawsuit, i.e., Governor Phil Bryant, Attorney General Jim Hood, and the Circuit Clerk of Hinds County. The Office of Vital Records is not subject to the order you seek to enforce. As such, and while noting that she disagrees with the states interpretation, Kaplan is asking Reeves to expand his injunction to cover the Department of Health explicitly. Additionally, Tuesdays filing asks Reeves to order that all recusals are posted publicly and that a plan is in place to ensure that the authorization and licensing of legally valid marriages shall not be impeded or delayed. Finally, the filing asks for the expanded injunction to include a provision ordering that those seeking a recusal under the new law not be permitted to issue marriage licenses to any couples. [A]lthough the most recent efforts by the State of Mississippi to disregard the constitutional rights of LGBT Mississippians through HB 1523 may be somewhat more subtle than the steel-hard, inflexible, undeviating official policy of the past, the lawyers write, quoting from a 1963 appeals court case ordering the end to racial segregation in bus and railway terminals, the underlying impulse is exactly the same. Asked why, after having gone through the initial lawsuit, Pritchett and her family were taking on the new law as well, she told BuzzFeed News they did have several sleepless nights over the decision to do so. Mississippi is not a place that goes quietly into change. Our marriage license may have claw marks all over it when we die but it will be no less valid, Pritchett wrote. In short, were doing this because we can. Mississippi will not change without federal help, and our kids, our friends and our friends kids deserve nothing less than full equality under the law.

aS"Looking in the mirror, on the days Im brave enough to do it, can shatter my exquisitely constructed sense of myself. View this image  The emotional and physical discomfort associated with gender dysphoria can be nearly impossible to describe to someone who has never experienced it. This particular type of dysphoria is often defined as a condition where an individual experiences discomfort or distress because their gender identity doesnt match the gender they were assigned at birth. But what does gender dysphoria really feel like? What does it look like? We asked people to illustrate their dysphoria in whatever form they preferred. Here are some of the art submissions we received: View this image  Im not particularly good at drawing, so I included an example of some of the needlework I do. I find it much easier to get across what I want using threads. For me, my assigned gender has always been a box I was put into without my permission. Its restricting, and suffocating, and for most of my life it completely obscured who I was, like a cloud of pink that hides my inner colors from the world. It often feels like Ill never really be able to break out of the box, so instead I do my best to change its colors and make the box a place I can survive in. Some days are better than others, and Im getting better and better at pushing the pink back, but its always trying to reclaim lost ground. Its still all some people will ever be able to see when they look at me. Cael View this image  Being trapped in the wrong body was never a phrase that really stuck with me because I think that sets my body in the wrong light. There are a lot of things my body does really well its just that it had the wrong set of building blocks when it was developing its look. I sympathize with my body because not only me, but everyone around me, keeps drilling on it because of a few little mistakes it has made even if it tries really hard to correct those mistakes. Lets just all give my body a break. Dont act like every single one of you doesnt have something about your body you dont like. Mine just happens to be a little more contradictory to what I am. Felix View this image  To me, dysphoria comes mostly from peoples gazes and words. They see me as a girl and call me as such even in the most innocent way simply because they dont know. Being called that, because of my body shape, feels like being trapped into a tight envelope made out of girl stereotypes and expectations. A girl suit that is slowly choking me. The more they call me girl, the more the girl suit takes over, covering my real self, my real colors. Pimelex View this image  Dysphoria isnt just one thing for me, its a combination of things I think are happening and the things that are actually happening, and they build throughout the day. Id be getting ready to leave the house for work or some recreational fun with friends or errands, and while getting ready I catch a hard edge on my face in my reflection and I automatically imagine what people see as I walk down the streetand I just want to lay down and drink. But Ive made a commitment, so I have to leave the house. As Im walking people tend to stare at me and I feel like Im ass-naked walking on a sidewalk to nowhere with disapproving eyes watching me, judging me the whole way. That builds to the point where Im light-headed and dizzy and I cant tell if Im asleep or awake shrouded in a dark haze. Once I reach my destination, whether thats a store or a bar or the pharmacy, and they ask for ID (and my ID still has my birth name and the wrong gender on it) I can see the change in their expression, hear it in their voice, or see the surprise in their eyes. Feels like my ID just mutters off a bunch of manly, masculine nonsense, and my heart drops into my diaphragm, and Im just likeDAMN, CLOCKED!!! Its enough to drive you mad, but there are folks who bring you back down and remind you that youre more than your dysphoria and this too shall pass. Wriply View this image  When seeing my dysphoria run through my body I try my hardest to detach myself from social conditioning. Im not supposed to be wearing lipstick or eyeliner while having cute little hairs on my chin and lips. I must be quiet. I must be a magical femme who does all the emotional labor. My masculinity and I can only meet in privacy. My emotional labor ends up being split between femme labor and surviving a white-cis-hetero world while being a brown non-binary trans person. Thats a lot. The binary is a lot. My masculinity is as feminine as it can get. I cant and wont dare separate my masculinity away from my femininity Its difficult to water myself when everything outside of myself, I cant control. Only thing I can control is my self-care. So what do I do!? I hold onto some lavender that I gently put on my palms. I whisper affirmations and inhale the lavender. I let my body experience the emotions it needs to feel better, to grow, nurture itself. I wear my emotions while simultaneously making myself as visible as possible externally. I wont dare be invisible when I continue to exist under these painful circumstances. I will celebrate my sadness by crying more, by loving myself more radically. I wont dare let anyone condition and normalize their phobias and gender roles onto me. I will dare exist as a magical Trans Non-Binary femmeboi. I will dare question the binary. Car-oh View this image  I wake up in the morning and run my hands over my body. It never feels exactly the way it should. Looking in the mirror, on the days Im brave enough to do it, can shatter my exquisitely constructed sense of myself. My clothes are never, ever right. Showering is the most jarring part of my day when I soap my thighs and chest and do my damnedest to hold on to the mental picture I have of who I really am and not the baggy, chubby, soft version of myself I feel under the running water. Wiley Reading View this image  I am usually fairly self-conscious about my raw appearance, but I had an urge to illustrate how I feel about my body from my inner perspective, and it became an honest portrait of myself. A mixture of what I look like and how I feel. When I think of my chest as it currently is, I feel incredibly awkward. Its almost as if I have these water balloons stuck on me and I cant take them off. I hope someday I can resolve thatbut until then, it is a thing I find myself occasionally struggling with. Some days are better than others. Anonymous View this image  Dysphoria for me is feeling like a tangled mess. Everything is tangled, and I feel disgusting in my skin. I hear the ringing in my ears, my head wont stop buzzing, and my face burns with embarrassment because of how round my face is or because how short I am or because my hips are wider than a boys. I feel like crying, and I hate myself and the body I was born with. I keep reminding myself how feminine I sound or how no one will ever use my preferred pronouns because of my appearance. I wish I had been born into a different body. I wish I didnt feel so tangled. Anonymous View this image  My dysphoria is not feeling like a man because the only affirmations I get are at school. My dysphoria is binding every day just so I can focus on my schoolwork because I cant look down at my paper without seeing my breasts. Dysphoria, for me, is feeling invalid because the questioning never goes away because the idea that I am not a man is beaten into me daily with purposeful misgendering and verbal assaults.

I identify as non-binary and genderqueer, so for me, deciding on a medical intervention for my dysphoria did not feel as simple as the most common narratives you hear for trans people the body I was born to have or the way I see myself inside or anything like that. I dont feel that there is a right way for any body to be, and I value the ways that bodies are queer, unreadable, and unruly. So it helped me a lot to sort through my feelings without words, just trying to exist in my body, pay attention, and make some art. Jesse Harold View this image  A loose self-portrait displaying my wish to rid of my dysphoria: social, physical, and mental. Jay Atlas Alexander View this image  Gender dysphoria is sadness. Its paranoia, depression, anxiety, envy, disgust, anger; its all of the emotions no one likes to feel. Gender dysphoria is changing 10 times before leaving the house and still not feeling comfortable in your own skin. Gender dysphoria is not wanting to get out of bed. Gender dysphoria is feeling hopeless and lost. There is nothing beautiful about gender dysphoria, it is the ugliest and saddest Ive ever felt and I would never wish these feelings upon even my most hated enemies. Jonny gisellekcwestart.tumblr.com gisellekcwestart.tumblr.com This piece showcases someone trapped by the wishes of others, the confines of society, and the internal and ever present struggle to be happy. This piece has helped me to share one of the most hidden parts of myself, a piece Ive kept caged in aid of others comfort. But my happiness and health are now front and center and here I am. I hope that this helps speak to others who feel as I do. My chest surrounds a lot of dysphoria for me, and I am trying to find ways to be comfortable in my skin. These pieces show just how much of a difference wearing a binder does for me. It lets me feel a little less caged in. Giselle KC-West View this image  My mind copes with dysphoria in strange ways. I am a transmasculine person, and I almost always feel disconnected from my body, like I dont have one or like Im not even in my body. Because my brain doesnt seem to recognize my body as my own, I dont feel intense dysphoria about what seems wrong about it. In my drawing, the cloud around my head represents my soul, or my consciousness, floating above my body. This is how I feel just about every day; throughout school, during my free time, and even when Im doing things that I enjoy. I feel like Im floating above my body, detached from it. The red marks on my body are my struggle with dermatillomania, or skin-picking. Every day, I cave in to the feeling that I need to pick and rub my skin. Through some research, I found out that these types of disorders are often associated with body dysphoria and dysmorphia. The marks in my drawing are in the exact places that they are on my real body. I included them to show that dysphoria is so much more than just feeling uncomfortable it can have a major impact on a persons everyday life. Anonymous View this image  Everything reminding me of my body is like a very big punch on my face, whether its things I notice on me (body features, voice, etc.) or things that I notice I dont have but cis women do. I feel like every day, every minute I have to struggle, and I feel like all of these things are dragging me down, threatening my mental health. Yet, at the same time, I have to put on a mask and pretend everythings all right, so nobody knows whats happening under the surface.

aS"In an interview with BuzzFeed News, Anthony Fauci, longtime head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, talked about the best AIDS president, the real threat of Zika, and what hell do if Trump wins. View this image  Jared Harrell / BuzzFeed News In 1984, as the AIDS epidemic erupted, Anthony Fauci took the helm of the federal research institute devoted to fighting infectious disease, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. At the time, Ronald Reagan wouldnt even say the word AIDS publicly. Behind the scenes there was pretty much the realization this was something we need to respond to, Fauci told BuzzFeed News science editor Virginia Hughes. But publicly he was very disappointing. Reagan only spoke up about AIDS late in his second term under the prodding of movie star Elizabeth Taylor, Fauci added, who essentially almost embarrassed him, really laid it on the line that he needed to talk about it. Fauci, 75, has served under five presidents during his tenure, leading the U.S. governments response to every outbreak from AIDS to Ebola to Zika. His interview with BuzzFeed News on Monday comes as Americans await the start of a summer mosquito season that threatens to bring the tropical Zika virus linked to devastating birth defects to the U.S. In terms of risk to Americans, he said, Zika is less threatening than a pandemic flu, and far scarier than Ebola. If you look at Zika broadly, then it is very mild illness for most of us, he said. For pregnant women it is a potential disaster. The World Health Organization has predicted that more than 2,500 infants in Brazil will develop microcephaly, the severe shrunken brain birth defect, as a result of their mothers infection with Zika virus in the last year. The virus has spread to 35 countries and regions, and public health experts dread a repeat of this birth defect epidemic across South America and the Caribbean. Puerto Rico, for example, is already reporting hundreds of cases transmitted by mosquito bites, and is expected to see 700,000 people infected with Zika. How do you treat this in a country where 60% of the pregnancies are unintended, where women dont have access to contraception, where the Catholic Church doesnt want anything to do with terminating a pregnancy? Fauci asked. Ultimately, vaccination for Zika virus will become a standard part of childhood in South America and the Caribbean, Fauci said. But scientists have to create the vaccine first, with safety tests of an experimental inoculation set to start in September. The advent of Zika reinforces the key difficulty of Faucis job, he said: getting across the difference between the real but scant threat of a new disease he called fears of Ebola spreading to America in 2015 overblown against the risks, like car wrecks and hospital-borne infections, that we face everyday. In last years Ebola outbreak, when Fauci and National Institutes of Health personnel cared for two people sick with the disease at the Maryland NIH campus, he recalled, some parents were afraid of letting their kids play at a daycare center where a nurses child played. During the AIDS crisis of the 1980s, he said, people asked him if their gay waiter would give them what was then called Gay-Related Immune Deficiency. The chances of that happening was infinitesimally small compared to you chance of walking outside the restaurant and being hit by a truck, Fauci said. When a new risk occurs in life, it instinctively occupies more attention than the other risks we face. What really keeps Fauci awake at night are fears of a highly infectious disease, like the flu, with a high mortality rate. The deadly Spanish Flu outbreak of 1918 that killed perhaps 50 million people had a mortality rate of less than 2%, Fauci noted. An infectious disease that is 10% lethal would be a total global catastrophe. Of the Presidents he has served, Fauci said George W. Bush was the most supportive of public health, calling for the five-year, $15 billion plan, the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), in his 2003 State of the Union address. The development of drug combination therapy for HIV had turned what was once terrifying and deadly for Americans into a manageable disease by Bushs administration, while leaving millions of Africans at risk. He said to me that as a rich nation we have a moral obligation to do something, Fauci said. For those of you who dont like George W. Bush, he really said that. And Bush followed through, with PEPFAR continuing and likely saving the lives of 9 million people in Africa by now. President Clinton, in contrast, disappointed Fauci by failing to support federal funding of needle exchanges after it was shown to dramatically reduce HIV infections among drug abusers, Fauci said. He didnt do it. And to this day he says that he should have. The current president, Obama, has been constrained by a Congress opposed to his ideas, Fauci said, alluding to an ongoing dispute over the administrations $1.9 billion request for funds to develop a Zika vaccine and support mosquito eradication. The request is stalled in Congress, where some have called for federal agencies to divert unspent Ebola funds to the Zika response. And what about a President Trump? Fauci says he would stick around. Im not a political appointee, he said. Im a scientist and a public health official. Ive been one before they all came, Ill be one when they all leave Im not going to quit depending on whos president.

aS"Governor Pattrick McCrory sued the federal government on Monday after it challenged a bathroom law in his state. Hours later, the DOJ shot back with its own suit. Gerry Broome / AP North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory, facing a Department of Justice deadline to decide if his state would not comply with an anti-LGBT bathroom law, defiantly sued the federal agency on Monday and hours later the DOJ responded with its own suit against the state. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the law which was passed in March and bans transgender people access to restrooms that match their gender identity in government buildings and schools violates federal civil rights laws which prohibit discrimination in the workplace on the basis of sex. The law known as HB2 created state-sponsored discrimination against transgender individuals, who simply seek to engage in the most private of functions in a place of safety and security a right taken for granted by most of us, Lynch said at a news conference Monday afternoon. McCrory, in his lawsuit, called the Justice Departments stance a baseless and blatant overreach, and sued Lynch and U.S. Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta for their radical interpretation of Title VII which would prevent plaintiffs from protecting the bodily privacy rights of state employees while accommodating the needs of transgendered state employees. The Department of Justice lawsuit says HB2 stigmatizes and singles out transgender employees, results in their isolation and exclusion, and perpetuates a sense that they are not worthy of equal treatment and respect. The Justice Department is seeking a statewide ban on the law and has retained options of curtailing federal funding to the states Department of Public Safety and the University of North Carolina. This action is about a great deal more than just bathrooms, Lynch said. This is about the dignity and respect we accord our fellow citizens and the laws that we, as a people and as a country, have enacted to protect them indeed, to protect all of us. Here are the three claims raised in today's DOJ complaint against NC: https://t.co/bNAAwDnbQZ Following letters the Department of Justice sent to the McCrory last week, the federal agency had given the governor until Monday, May 9, to respond with a solution to remedy the situation. McCrory claims that transgendered people are not protected under Title VII and that a court, and not the Department of Justice, should dictate what laws require. This is an attempt to unilaterally rewrite long-established federal civil rights laws in a manner that is wholly inconsistent with the intent of Congress and disregards decades of statutory interpretation by the courts, McCrorys lawsuit reads. In a press conference Monday afternoon, McCrory said the issue has raised major privacy concerns about males entering female facilities or females entering male facilities a scenario which has never been documented in the 17 states and 225 cities that currently ban transgender discrimination. McCrory said the Department of Justices letter was a substantial request with serious implication, and he only had three business days to respond. He asked the Department of Justice for a two week extension but was denied unless he publicly stated that he agreed with the federal agencys interpretation of the law. McCrory is asking the courts to clarify federal law as North Carolina does not treat transgender employees differently from non-transgender employees, according to the lawsuit. Were taking the Obama admin to court. They're bypassing Congress, attempting to rewrite law & policies for the whole country, not just NC. Our lawsuit seeks to ensure that NC continues to receive federal funding until the courts clarify federal law & resolve this national issue. Lynch delivered impassioned remarks in favor of transgender people both in the suit and during her news conference. She compared HB2 to Jim Crow laws and same-sex marriage bans and said none of us can stand by when a state enters the business of legislating identity. We see you, Lynch said directly to transgender people, we stand with you; and we will do everything we can to protect you going forward. An individuals sex consists of multiple factors, which may not always be in alignment. Among those factors are hormones, external genitalia, internal reproductive organs, chromosomes, and gender identity, which is an individuals internal sense of being male or female, the lawsuit said. The Attorney General of Texas released a statement standing with McCrory. Last year, Houston voters repealed a city law that protected LGBT people from discrimination.

aS"1,179,811       VIEWS Things are about to get messy. FYI: Despite these horrifying anecdotes, anal sex can also be very enjoyable if you and your partner(s) are into it. Check out some helpful advice here. I met up with a guy from Grindr, and he had the biggest penis Id ever seen. I had to take his penis out of my ass because it hurt so bad, and he said, Damn, you made a mess. I saw what looked like a gallon of beef stew, and the smell soon followed. He started puking all down my back, and it ran into my hair, eyes, his bed, and the floor. His sister knocked on the door to see what was going on, and he started freaking out. He ran into the bathroom while I, still covered in poop and puke, tried to put on my clothes. It was impossible to leave with any dignity. DutchMN When I was in high school, my boyfriend and I were hooking up in his car, and he suggested we do anal. I agreed, but felt nervous about it because I had no idea what itd be like. So he put it in and my asshole was not down I ended up shitting all over him. I immediately started crying while he was wiping his shit-covered dick off with my sock. chloep4 View this image  I have a heart condition where I faint when I get hurt. I dont tell many people, cause I dont think everyone needs to know. Well, my boyfriend was slamming into me during sex once and slipped out, and when he tried to ram it back in, he accidentally went in the wrong hole. I screamed and tried to run to the bathroom I didnt want to faint in front of him. But I didnt make it; I passed out on his bedroom floor and woke up to hear him screaming for his MOM to come help! brittanyd26 I kept telling my now ex-boyfriend that I didnt like anal because it always hurt too much. But he kept whining, so I said fuck it. Well, Id eaten a big bowl of grapes that day, and sure enough, he entered me and I let out a fart so juicy he felt it vibrate on his thing. He never asked for it again. danielleh66 View this image  I was on my period and we wanted to have sex, so we decided on anal. About 20 minutes earlier, I had the urge to poop, but never did. We got hot and heavy, I was getting rammed into the wall, hurt my shoulder, ended up completely pooping on his wiener, and because it was so rough, I bled for two days out of my butt. kmkluk It was my first time ever trying anal sex with my boyfriend. We had a few drinks, and he finally convinced me to try it. He used some lube, but within two minutes, my ass was on FIRE I had an allergic reaction to the lube he chose! It has forever scarred me from trying again. abbeyl4 View this image  I was seeing this very laid-back, nice guy and decided he was the first I should share anal with. We were going at it, and I took it well. Suddenly, he pulled out and calmly walked away. I stayed there, my ass invitingly in the air, waiting for him to return. When he finally did, he silently wiped my ass with a paper towel. Apparently poop had gotten all over it and his penis. hollyc4 I was experimenting with my partner, and it initially wasnt as bad as Id anticipated. But as he was pulling out, he moved too quickly, and I just started leaking runny cum diarrhea. I ran naked to the toilet, and there was poo on his thighs and all over our bed and floor leading to the bathroom. chelseakc18 View this image  I hooked up with a guy on Grindr. We banged in his car, and once wed finished, we couldnt find the condom. We spent ages looking for it before I decided to just leave and go home. Turns out the condom was hanging out of my butthole like a rubbery blue tail. robertw42 I was having sex with my ex, and after we finished and cleaned up, we got into bed. He pointed at something, and goes, Whats that? It was the littlest poop. It had fallen out of one of our butts and was just there on the bed, staring at me. The next time I went to his place, he had a douche set waiting in his bathroom. craigjohnm View this image  My man and I used to live with housemates, so wed sneak into the forest to have sex. One day we were in our forest place, and he put it in my butt. After he pulled out, his dick and my butt were all covered in jizzy, liquid poop. We had to clean up as best we could, using leaves and my hoodie. I then had to transport my poopy hoodie all the way home to wash it. Pearl Black, Facebook The first (and only) time my husband and I did it, I got super emotional afterward because I saw a piece of shit on the floor next to the bed and thought it was mine. I was hysterical crying and basically screaming. I blame it on the super-sensitive nerves he penetrated. And after all of it I learned the shit on the floor was from one of our dogs. Katherine Leigh Lyles, Facebook View this image  My boyfriend came home drunk and wanted anal. We had done it once before, but we were both sober and careful to go slow and use lube. This time he was so drunk, he poured lube ALL OVER my ass and shoved his dick right in! It hurt so bad I had to stop him after a minute or two. The next morning he went to the bathroom and found SHIT under his foreskin that had been there all night! sarahm4 We were attempting shower sex, and he mistook the back door for the front door when he just went for it. Wed never tried anal before, so my body went into shock and I passed out right there, in the shower. laurab4 View this image  We did anal for 20 minutes, and afterward I felt ~not quite right~. When I got to the toilet, the seat was down, and it had a soft-close lid so by the time the lid was down, Id pooped all over the floor. There was runny shit down my leg and it smelled awful, but I didnt know what to do. There was no shower in the bathroom, and I couldnt bear to escape, so I had to use half a roll of toilet paper to wash the floor, and washed my leg in the sink. I went back to his room 15 minutes later, pretending nothing happened. Bridget May Jackson, Facebook View this image  Note: Submissions have been edited for length and/or clarity.

View this image  Bellerive Lindisfarne Parish The booklet, distributed to Catholic schoolchildren and congregations across Australia, outlines the Churchs opposition to same-sex marriage and parenting. Martine Delaney submitted a complaint over the Dont Mess With Marriage booklet in September last year, contending that the booklet was insulting, offensive and humiliating towards same-sex attracted people. After the conciliation process broke down, Delaney withdrew her complaint last week due to the cost of a tribunal hearing and her fear that traditional marriage activists would continue to cite the case as evidence their voices were being shut down. View this image  Martine Delaney She did not remove any Church teachings or beliefs, and mostly inserted words such as we hold and we believe before various statements. View this image  Martine Delaney In a statement last week, the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference said they entered the negotiations in good faith. In order to have a flourishing democratic society, it is fundamental that all citizens have the freedom to express different convictions according to their judgements, beliefs or faith in a way that respects the dignity of all persons, the statement read. View this image  Martine Delaney View this image  Martine Delaney I went to a lot of trouble to actually rework that document to make sure it wasnt making quasi-scientific statements of fact about the parenting abilities of same-sex couples, but it was still very clearly the Church saying we dont agree, and we dont support changes to the Marriage Act, she said. The Church did not accept the proposed changes and offered a counter proposal in which both parties would state their regret that people had misinterpreted their intentions. The document remains online unaltered. The reality is, if this went on for years before it was resolved in the tribunal during that time, you would have people screaming that they couldnt speak for fear of lawsuits, that they were the persecuted Christians who couldnt speak their minds, Delaney said.

aS"Double the mommas, double the love. The struggle of having two moms  View this image  Wendy, 34 I call them my moms or my Ms. Daisies since I drive them around. The best part about having two moms is that I have been fortunate to learn from both of them equally. I have learned how to be an extremely strong, independent female, while also strengthening my femininity as each of my moms have contrasting and complementary characteristics that I can grow from. Not many girls can say they had two positive female role models in their life. I have been fortunate to have two moms for most of my life, ever since I was about 4 years old. My moms really exposed me to having a sense of adventure and being open to travel and learn about new cultures and people. It was always like a girls weekend when we would be together. Now that we are older, its like hanging with the girls. View this image  Thank you for helping me become the woman I am today. Happy Mothers Day moms! View this image  Seth, 16 I grew up calling Nina Mom and Stacy Pop.  The best part of having two moms, is having two parents. Their gender does not change how much they love me. I only know this style of family, and from what Ive seen its not that different from heterosexual families. Mothers day is pretty interesting in my house, we generally just have a day of appreciation for everything my parents do, nothing frilly, just love. I love how compassionate, hard working, kind, and helpful they are. I also love how they were the couple that sued the state of Vermont and helped make same-sex unions legal in the first state to have any sort of LGBTQ union. View this image  View this image  Kaley, 25 I call both of our moms mom. If they are both in the same room, I call them Mom and Jojo. The best part about having two moms is having two loving, strong, and resilient women to look up to. Throughout our lives they have been such strong leaders in our community and have modeled a beautiful partnership that I aspire to one day have. This past year has been one of the hardest years of our lives after losing my little brother and because of that our bonds have become stronger. My family has also experienced the strength and love of our community first hand. I have felt the depth of connection and support from the web of relationships my moms created to support our family and am so thankful for our larger COLAGE and LGBTQ family. I love my moms for their endless strength and resiliency in the face of tragedy and adversity. View this image  Their love has not gone unnoticed and I am so thankful for their support. Moms, I know if Joseph were here he would want you to know how special you both are. We love you Mom and Jojo. View this image  Heather Griffiths, 30 My dad (now Kimberly) came out as transgender about a year ago and things changed in our family I believe for the better. The best part about having two moms and a stepmom is my different but equally special relationships with all of them. Kimberly and Heather's stepmom, Sally, at her 30th birthday dinner. Heather's biological mom cuddling with her nephew Cody. My biological mom, Kathleen, is my best friend. We have always been very close and I share everything with her. We take vacations just the two of us and spend a lot of time talking. My Stepmom Sally and I havent always had the easiest relationship I was very young when she married my Dad and I of course went through a bit if a rebellious teen phase and we werent always as close. That only strengthened our relationship to what it is today. She is my mom, my friend, and provides a completely different perspective and advice than my mom. I am so thankful to have her in my life and most thankful my dad has her in her life. My dad (who I still call dad in private were a work in progress), who is now, or maybe has always really been a woman, is a special relationship. I grew up with her as my goofy dad who taught me about music and life and acceptance. She is now for all intents and purposes my mom. One of them! We are currently trying to figure out a name that fits her and is still a term we can use, other than her name, thats parental. Weve looked things up and have found some cute ones like Mad (mom and dad mixed) or Moppa (momma and poppa mixed), but none feel exactly right for us. Everyone is constantly changing and evolving as is our family. View this image  View this image  Erica, 22 Mothers Day is extra special to me its also extra work!

My stepmom is the good kind, not the evil Disney kind. What I love about my moms is that they wear matching costumes on Halloween. Last year they were gum-ball machines, and the year before? Bananas. View this image  Ava, 15 I love having two moms because they are both cool, quirky, fun loving people just like all normal families are in this day and age. However, I do NOT like having two moms on mothers day. This Mothers Day, like every other Mothers Day, will be double the work for my sister and I. Again, having two moms is great, (most of the time) but what was obviously looked past in the creation of this alleged holiday is the fact that two moms is double the work! Luckily, our parents arent that high-maintenance and they let us off the hook with nice cards and breakfast in bed. Firstly, its hard to please them because they are SO different. Sometimes I wish my parents were both just stereotypical lesbians who would be cool if I let them watch sports and talk about the new way to style their short hair. But no, of course I get stuck with one mom who would rather be shopping, and one mom who would rather be watching tennis. View this image  I hope we make you proud this Mothers Day, Love Ava.

aS"BuzzFeed News Investigation: The police complaints watchdog is being urged to launch an inquiry after a new victim revealed how he had twice reported being raped as a child in the notorious London apartment block but officers have declined to investigate. View this image  Lynzy Billing / BuzzFeed / SWNS The independent police complaints watchdog is facing calls to investigate how two forces handled the case of a sexual abuse survivor who reported that he was raped as a child in Dolphin Square, the apartment block at the centre of the Westminster paedophile scandal. In a case that raises fresh questions about the former Metropolitan police inquiries into historical abuse, the survivor, David, has spoken out for the first time about his 30-year search for answers after being abused as child by a well-connected Lincolnshire landowner who, he told police, took him to Dolphin Square at least 10 times in the early 1980s. In March the Mets Operation Midland, which was set up to investigate historical claims, was shut down. But in an attempt to highlight the alleged mishandling of his case by detectives from both the Met and Lincolnshire forces, David has decided to waive his right to anonymity and allow his real first name and photograph to be published alongside his account. David, now 49, told BuzzFeed News how he was groomed in Lincolnshire in 1982 when he was 15 by Gordon Dawson, who took him to dinners in London with Dawsons friends. Among them, David was told, were MPs, businessmen, senior military officers, and members of the General Synod. After these dinners, David said, he would be raped in a Dolphin Square apartment by Dawson and other men. He reported his experiences in Dolphin Square to Lincolnshire Police in 2007, seven years before the location became infamously linked to the more extreme stories of abuse and murder. He repeated his allegations to officers from Operation Fairbank the Mets overarching inquiry into historical abuse by public figures in 2015. Last November, Justice Goddard, chair of the ongoing independent inquiry into child sexual abuse, announced that allegations involving abuse in Westminster would form part of the inquiry. Also last year, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) watchdog announced 29 investigations into allegations of cover-ups by Metropolitan police officers in cases involving sexual abuse. Davids evidence, given over two days of interviews and supported by a series of legal documents, exposes the difficulties still faced by some survivors of sexual abuse to ensure the police investigate even amid a national furore over such crimes. A six-month investigation by BuzzFeed News into the allegations found that:  Despite the seriousness of the allegations, a surviving friend of Gordon Dawsons who was present at the dinners and it is alleged also used the same apartment in which David was raped has never been interviewed by Met detectives.  In March 2015, just three months after appealing to the public for information about abuse at Dolphin Square, the Met told David the luxury apartment block was not being investigated.  In an email to David, a senior Metropolitan police officer from Operation Fairbank, Detective Sergeant James Townly, claimed it is not feasible for the police to identify every link between paedophiles, and suggested police were unwilling to investigate suspects not already known to them.  Dawson had been warned by a Lincolnshire police officer in December 2006 that he was about to be arrested over a series of earlier abuse complaints a move a top criminal lawyer said was unusual as it risked allowing the suspect to destroy evidence.  Two months later, when David reported the abuse to police, the same officer warned Dawson that he was to be rearrested. Dawson killed himself within 90 minutes of the phone call. View this image  David SWNS for BuzzFeed The police are not doing their job, David told BuzzFeed News as he called for the IPCC to investigate his case and confirmed he would be making a formal complaint to the watchdog. If we could just get the truth, answers to the questions we have, to find out what really happened why did the investigation stop so quickly? Why were things done in such a strange way? he said. I wish they treated this case with the seriousness it deserves instead of treating it like somebody had stolen a bike. Reopening the case would be the only way. He was backed by Keith Best, chief executive of the abuse victims group Survivors UK, who said there were grave errors in the investigation by Lincolnshire police and subsequent interventions from Scotland Yard that demand a new inquiry by the IPCC. Best said: There must be grave suspicion of a failure by the police to investigate fully and act appropriately in this case of undoubted, verified abuse. This follows the courage of the victim to come forward to expose what went on, as well as painstaking research by BuzzFeed. He added: The current unsatisfactory situation not only leaves considerable suspicion but also a massive discouragement to others to come forward in similar cases. Nigel Richardson, a leading criminal lawyer and expert on investigating sexual offences, said he was perplexed by the Mets failure to investigate all potential leads, such as interviewing the close friend of Dawson. It seems to me its part of their duty to carry out an investigation into those, at least to rule them out, he said. Richardson also described the warnings to Dawson by the Lincolnshire officer as odd, irregular, and unusual for an allegation of this seriousness, as they could prevent the police from seizing crucial evidence and left the complainant without protection from any potential action by the accused. Dolphin Square has been at the centre of the Westminster paedophile scandal since 2014, when two individuals claimed that the apartment block, which was once home to over 100 MPs, had been the venue for the abuse and even murder of children by VIPs during the 1970s and 1980s. But Davids evidence shows police received complaints about child abuse in Dolphin Square in 2007, seven years before they issued their appeal to the public for information. After Dawsons apparent suicide, the IPCC refused to examine the case, sending it back to Lincolnshire police to review. BuzzFeed News has learned that the internal report into the conduct of officers in the original investigation has been destroyed. In recent months, the tone of the coverage of historical abuse allegations has changed, with serious doubts raised over the claims involving Dolphin Square, and with the police unable to substantiate the chief claims surrounding it allegations made by a man known as Nick. In a statement to BuzzFeed News, a Met spokesperson said: Whilst we do not discuss identities, we can confirm that experienced officers working to Detective Sergeant Townly in SOECA [the Mets Sexual Offences, Exploitation & Child Abuse division] did review the material in this case, including speaking with relevant people. This work was subsequently reviewed by DS Townly. In the absence of new lines of enquiry, substantive allegations made, or further new witnesses the matter remains closed. The spokesperson said the Met strongly denied any suggestion that it did not sufficiently investigate allegations against individuals who were not high-profile, and said the force would investigate without fear or favour allegations reported to police. The IPCC said it had received a referral in 2007 from Lincolnshire regarding a death following police contact. Its statement continued: From the information provided as part of that referral there did not appear to be any evident misconduct matters, and no complaint was made. Therefore a local investigation was determined as the appropriate course of action. We requested at the time that if any potential misconduct matters came to light as part of the local investigation, those matters should be re-referred to us for a re-determination. We received no further referral from Lincolnshire Police, nor was a complaint made to us regarding these matters. The sexual abuse allegations and details of that investigation were not referred to us. As we do not have this information we are unable to comment further on those matters. BuzzFeed News sent a detailed list of allegations and questions to Lincolnshire police regarding their investigation. Eleven days after the deadline for a response, they replied: We will not be responding to your queries. 3.

aS"Pastor David Meredith violated United Methodist Church policies that ban ministers from being openly gay and prohibit same-sex marriage three days before the churchs international voting body will meet to consider changing church doctrine. View this image  Jim Schlachter, left, and David Meredith. Katelyn Scott Pastor David Meredith, an ordained minister of the United Methodist Church, married his boyfriend of 28 years on Saturday in a potent protest against church doctrine that bans ministers from marrying same-sex partners. I am completely aware that there are consequences, but I am not afraid, Meredith told BuzzFeed News in a phone call before the ceremony, pointing out he could be defrocked, removed from his congregation in Cincinnati, and lose his income. The wedding was, of course, primarily about his union with Jim Schlachter, he said. But, he added, if it leads to a change, it will be a big win. The timing was deliberate. With the churchs international voting body meeting Tuesday in Oregon, the high-profile marriage could persuade delegates at the General Conference to pass several proposals that would repeal the churchs anti-gay rules. Those rules ban clergy from being out homosexuals, prohibit clergy from marrying same-sex couples, and bar funding for LGBT-positive organizations. Rev. Susan Brooks Thistlethwaite, a professor of theology at the Chicago Theological Seminary, told BuzzFeed News, This is a very important moment for the United Methodist Church. I think the wedding can inspire empathy among the delegates, because you have a Methodist pastor this is one of the leaders of the church. This is someone they have ordained, and that is important to other church leaders. It was the latest example of a growing insurgency within the United Methodist Church, which has about 80 million followers. The churchs voting body shot down proposals in 2008 and 2012 to remove anti-gay policies. But now that the Supreme Court has scrapped marriage bans in the United States, many believe that high-profile acts of disobedience could have repercussions. Divisions within the church could lead to a mass exodus of progressives fed up with anti-gay rules, for example. Or, so many gay Methodists could disobey church doctrine that the rules become unenforceable. As BuzzFeed News reported last month, a Methodist minister married two gay men in North Carolina, and a formal complaint was filed within days. The local bishop launched an investigation into the minister, a straight pastor, who performed the wedding. In the past few years, another pastor was defrocked and a bishop faced an investigation for their roles in marrying gay couples. The church is at a boiling point over the wedding in North Carolina, and its going to boil even further, Matt Berryman, the executive director of Reconciling Ministries Network, an LGBT advocacy coalition leading the charge for changing Methodist policy on sexual orientation, told BuzzFeed News. His group has assembled hundreds of congregations that are on the record supporting LGBT rights. This wedding is a big deal because its happening right before the General Conference, he said. Its just a sign of whats to come.  The wedding in Ohio wasnt the first case of a United Methodist Church minister marrying a same-sex partner there are at least three other examples in the last decade, including one in Seattle in 2013 but the ceremony stands out for its calculated timing and geography. Held in a United Methodist Church in Columbus, it occurred in the churchs relatively conservative West Ohio Conference, where members are considered more likely to file a formal complaint. With about 7 million members in the U.S., the United Methodist Church is the largest mainline Protestant Christian denomination. Yet, unlike several other leading denominations, such as the Episcopal Church, it has not repealed its ban on same-sex weddings. And realistically, like its conventions in 2008 and 2012, the churchs General Conference appears unlikely to repeal the anti-gay rules this year. A majority of delegates represent foreign countries and the churchs large, growing African contingent is overwhelmingly opposed to LGBT inclusion. Failing to pass the proposals again would only exacerbate tensions and protest, Berryman said. If they dont change the rules, the reality is that this is just the beginning, he said. The floodgates will open and everyone should expect to see mass civil disobedience or biblical obedience after the General Conference. Weddings will be happening so frequently, the church will have to lay down its arms. Alternatively, Thistlethwaite said, the church risks losing its members. If they dont pass these proposals, I really think there will be a stampeding exodus from the United Methodist Church, because young people are just not having this anymore, she said. They are not willing to equate religion with discrimination. She added that the United Church of Christ could serve as an example: After it embraced marriage equality, some members left, but now, the policy on gay rights is an asset. Were growing, and the others are not, said Thistlethwaite, who belongs to the United Church of Christ. For his part, Pastor Meredith acknowledged that the General Conference may not pass proposals striking down anti-gay church rules. But they cant ignore it, said Meredith, who added that while he is breaking parts of canon law, he is obeying teachings of the Bible. Meredith said has never hidden the fact that he is gay from the churchs hierarchy, but he has never made it impossible for them to ignore until now. I want the policy to change, and I want the practice to change. I run the risk of losing it all, he continued. If they want me to say Im guilty, I wont say I am guilty. I will own that I am gay, but I will not own it with their language that says theres something wrong with it. I dont feel guilty for being gay. I am a better pastor and a better disciple of Jesus because of it. It doesnt feel like I am being brave or courageous, he said. Inside, it feels like I am being faithful. More than changing policy in the church, Meredith said he wants to change the Methodist churchs culture in Ohio. I hope that every person who is gay, lesbian, transgender, bisexual, or queer in the United Methodist Church will feel a sense of strength from this wedding. Having 400 Methodists at my wedding affirm, recognize, and bless 28 years of love and life together, nobody can take that away, he said. No General Conference can really harm me. No bishop can hurt me when I have the womb of the church surrounding me. The service itself was, in parts, traditional. There were church songs and a reading of the liturgy, Meredith said. But there were also some signature pieces from the gay canon, too. Our closing song is from Rent. 4. This Methodist Church Is Marrying Two Gay Men In An Act Of Civil Disobedience buzzfeed.com 5.

aS"Exclusive: In his first interview, a survivor called David reveals being groomed aged 15, being taken to dinners with MPs and then abused in the notorious Dolphin Square apartment block and the long search for justice that followed. View this image  SWNS for BuzzFeed News David was groggy when he woke up, he says. As he looked around, he knew where he was, because he had been there before: an apartment in Dolphin Square, central London. There was something else that was familiar. He was, he says now, wincing, naked. He was 15. His eyes flicker up to the right, reliving those moments in 1982 as if he were back there. Its obvious that somethings not right, he says. Its extremely painful. Memories from the night before would intrude in flashes being taken to a restaurant, to a table of men, and being told who they were: politicians, businessmen, senior members of the Church of England. Sometimes other boys his age were there too. As he looked down there would be another clue. Theres blood and bodily fluids, he says. The blood would be his, but the semen was not. He did not know then that it would take more than 30 years to try to find out whose it was. This is a story about a secret. At its heart is a man who has spent his life searching for justice but kept being denied it, blocked by forces he found hard to understand. Dominating everything, however, was a prolific child abuser with establishment connections whose name has been kept from prominence until now. When BuzzFeed News began investigating this story, the details, which pointed to a clutch of paedophiles operating across some of our most powerful institutions, seemed at first too grim and too outrageous to hold up. That was until we started examining the evidence, until the files began to surface, forced into the open through the Data Protection Act and the coroners court. These files not only corroborated Davids story, but expanded on it. There were details he wished he had not discovered. What emerged casts a different light on what we have heard. It reveals how a child from a loving family comes to fall into the hands of powerful predators, how boys like him were brought from the countryside into the capital for sexual exploitation and what is stacked against them when they come forward. Most surprising is what this case reveals about the police: how despite the prominence now afforded to sexual abuse, they continue to behave in strange and unaccountable ways. Ways that lead to troubling questions. David, now 49, sits upright in an armchair, hands gripped together, revisiting as much as he can. He has decided to forego his right to anonymity for his real first name and photograph to be used in the hope that he will, at last, be heard. We talk in a hotel room for two days. It is the start of the investigation, and as David begins it seems his story is centred on sexual abuse until something perhaps more startling appears. There are things he has never said aloud to another person.  View this image  David as a teenager outside Dalby House. David It was a family friend who first took an interest in David. His name was Gordon Dawson. In spring 1982, two months after turning 15, David moved with his parents and older brothers to Skendleby, a small, picturesque village in rural Lincolnshire. Pretty cottages punctuated the vast fields and farmland stretching out around the village. Dawsons property came within two fields of their home. David loved country life. Rarely watching television or reading newspapers, he instead preferred riding and cycling, and was, he says, unworldly for his age. He was very shy and very skinny, with a mass of dark hair atop sharp features. Davids father had previously had business dealings with Dawson, who was a landed farmer. And so when one day Dawson came to the family home to apologise for his uncle clipping Davids mothers wing mirror, there was already a connection. The visit sparked a close friendship between Dawson and Davids parents, enabling him to pop in for a chat several times a week. He was big, broad, burly, says David, with wraparound hair, and seemed jovial, warm, and very clever. David was aware of the power and wealth Dawson enjoyed. He was a big figure locally, a local ombudsman, involved in the church and the local dioceses. Well-respected, well-connected, knew everybody. Dawson lived with his wife in Dalby House, a huge country estate set in a thousand acres of land. It was there, amid the hedgerows and woodland of the estate, that Dawson indulged in his favourite pastime: shooting. He liked to include local boys in his pursuit. He would hold days for them called the Young Boys Shoot, says David, and never expected payment. View this image  Gordon Dawson in the early 1980s. David But Dawson offered to give David free one-to-one lessons an immensely generous offer, it seemed. And so, every couple of days, he would take David out to shoot rabbits. At night they would do so from inside his car. After the shot was fired, Dawson would keep holding on to him. I felt uncomfortable, but at the time you dont know how to compute it, David says, frowning, as if frustrated with himself. Over the course of one week in early summer 1982 that discomfort escalated. I remember him putting his hand on my leg. Things would happen gradually over the night more and more touching You just freeze. I didnt have the experience to know what to do. Hes the adult, the same age as my father. By the time hes got his hand on your crotch youre just You cant breathe. You feel absolutely paralysed. You cant recognise whats going on because you dont understand. Youre powerless to stop anything and he then decides hes going to put his hand inside David stops, before forcing himself to carry on. hes going to take your zip down and then it just happens. You just want it over as quick as possible. In the darkness, surrounded by private land, Dawson, says David, raped him. He didnt know at the time what the word was for what had happened. I didnt understand. Now I look back and that was absolutely what it was. David looks up intently, as if wanting to emphasise what took place there. I could show you on the map where the first time happened, he says. He remembers coming home afterwards. I didnt know what to say to my parents. I didnt want to upset them. View this image  Rebecca Hendin / SWNS for BuzzFeed News Dawson was charming and generous, leading Davids parents to believe their neighbour was a good friend. They had no idea what he was capable of. David begins to set out the pattern of behaviour Dawson was establishing he wasnt that bothered about you touching him, it was all about him using you when two aspects emerge that provide a vital clue to the later events in London. Dawson would never ejaculate, says David, and had such a small penis that being raped by him did not cause David bleeding, significant pain, or injury. Desperate to get away from Dawson, David told his parents he hated his new school, that he was struggling there, and complained so vehemently that they eventually agreed to let him return to his old school in Cambridgeshire, a two-hour drive away. It meant staying with old friends during the week. I thought I was removing myself from the situation, he says. It would prove catastrophic. Dawson offered to pick him up on Friday nights. At first this meant stopping in country lanes on the way back to Lincolnshire. He would turn off the engine and say, Right, and that was it you would think, Get it over with, David says. But shortly afterwards, in autumn 1982, Dawson made Davids parents another offer. He would say, Ill take David to London for the weekend and well go to the theatre! I couldnt get out of it my parents would say itd be great. By this stage, says David, he was becoming increasingly withdrawn. But how was he feeling? After hours of talking, remaining as calm and controlled as possible, David suddenly doubles over. Empty, he says, his voice strangled as he rubs tears away and attempts to carry on. Thats a horrible thing he whispers, a horrible thing He apologises and tries to regain composure. Empty because theres nothing left: Its a shell. Youre completely ruined. You think everyone can see it, even though nobody can and youd die if they could. View this image  Rebecca Hendin / SWNS for BuzzFeed News David remembers the first time Dawson took him to Dolphin Square, a vast 1930s complex in Pimlico, just a few streets from Westminster. To me it was very grand, he says. The 15-year-old, unused to such a venue, thought it was a hotel, and would later refer to it as such in his police statement. He remembers an underground car park from where they would walk up steps on to street level, to an arcade of shops, and then up more staircases and corridors to reach a flat. (Years later, he says, a family friend told him it was owned by Dawson and two other men.) David can still picture the inside: Very bijoux, cottage-y, magnolia walls, but the curtains were quite pretty yellows, blues, and greens and that theme ran throughout. On these trips to London, they would go shopping. Some of the gifts photos, paintings, a briefcase would end up in police possession. Traumatised by the memories, David is unsure of the exact number of times he was taken to Dolphin Square, but says his mother has told him it was at least 10 times. There was somewhere else Dawson took David, he says. We would go to church meetings at the [General] Synod. David would sit in, bored and unaware of Dawsons precise role there. But as they walked round Dolphin Square, says David, Dawson would tell him that people from the Synod also had flats there. In the corridors of the square, they would bump into other residents, he says suited men who knew Dawson and would stop to chat. View this image  Dolphin Square Carl Court / Getty Images It was all very jolly and familiar. He was very well-regarded. And I knew that lots of MPs lived there, and people from the church, because he told me. (Reports suggest over 100 MPs have had flats in the square.) In the evenings Dawson would take him to restaurants most frequently to Motcombs, an upscale establishment in Belgravia where a table of men would be waiting. He would tell me there were people there [at the table] who had big military careers, people from the church he would say that some are from the Synod and then [also] MPs. There always seemed to be a parliament connection. Theyd always be talking about something that had come up that day in the House [of Commons]. David would be introduced to them but, still only 15, would never be told their names. He [Dawson] was very cut and dried about that. He would say, You need to stop asking so many questions. You just need to remember these people are really important and you need to not tell anyone about this. As they ate, Dawson would give David red wine, he says. Sometimes at the dinners there was someone else my age, he says boys accompanying other men there. They wouldnt be sat together. The problem for David is that his memories cut out before the end of the evenings. I cannot remember leaving a restaurant, he says, frustrated again. [It] becomes very hazy, like you disappear, drift off, and then suddenly its the next day. I knew things had happened by the time I woke up, because its one thing Gordon having anal sex with you because he was very small and all the times he abused me he never climaxed. Waking up in Dolphin Square, however, was different. He revisits the scene in his mind, his voice tightening. If I was really sore, or itd been particularly bad, then I would be worried, he says. His response by then was practical. Youve got to tidy yourself up. I was really upset if there was a mess on the sheets, because Id think, Oh god, someones going to know. So I used to take the sheets off the bed before we left and put them in the bin. He stops for a moment, suddenly seeing those times with the perspective of an adult. View this image  Rebecca Hendin / SWNS for BuzzFeed News Thats when youre completely broken. Sometimes, on waking, he would hear male voices in the flat men who would leave soon after. After disposing of the sheets, David would have a bath as soon as he could, but Dawson, he says, would often join him: I said no on many occasions but it didnt work. On the way back to Lincolnshire, Gordon would say, No ones going to believe about Dolphin Square, and I didnt really understand what he meant. Its not until now that I understand the gravitas of it. Then, I thought that referred to the fact that physically [the abuse] had been quite a big event. What he was referring to, more than likely, was the people. The gaps in Davids memories follow a set pattern: being in restaurants, and then nothing until he wakes up in Dolphin Square. An acquaintance has since suggested to David that he might have been drugged, but David doesnt know. I know I was abused by Gordon, raped by him, he says. And there were certainly other people involved, there had to be, because of the after-effects and physical ramifications, but I dont know who. David is certain about this: After being raped in Lincolnshire, he would not bleed, be in pain, or have semen on him a distinct difference to waking up in London. Another memory taunts David. In addition to the trips to Dolphin Square, Dawson took David shooting on a few occasions to Blickling Estate, a stately home with vast grounds in Norfolk. While staying in local guesthouses, Dawson would abuse David again, he says. View this image  Blickling Hall ThinkStock One night in the room they were sharing, I remember something getting going, I remember there being more than one person it wasnt just Gordon, there were two others. I remember someones face being so he gestures a few inches away from his face. I can remember being forced into the bed, trying to see, and this chaps face is here and he had white/grey hair. I remember his hair because he had a lot of it. From the age of 17, after more than two years in Dawsons grip, David finally began to get away, by refusing to see him or go to London. By then, and despite an unusually high IQ, David had dropped out of school. He retreated from people youre safe on your own spending time instead with his horses. What was going through his mind during that period? That I might be finished That my life might be over He stops and breathes for a moment. but it didnt mean it had to be wasted. David vowed that somehow he would seek justice and find a way to use what happened to help others. The determination to do so would keep him going for years, fuelling everything that was to unfold. David tried to build a life. He had a relationship and told his partner what had happened to him. He became a racehorse trainer. But all through the 1980s and 1990s he lived with the memories of Gordon Dawson and Dolphin Square. In 1996, he disclosed what happened to a woman whod lived next door to him growing up, who also knew Dawson, and whose later police statement has been seen by BuzzFeed News. Elizabeths first words were, I wondered how long it was going to be before you told me. Her husband used to say, Why does that boy come down here talking to you? And she used to say to him, Because hes got something to tell me and one day he will. It wouldnt only be Elizabeth David would tell. After more than 20 years carrying shame and memories he could not bear, David decided to fulfil the promise hed made to himself two decades earlier. Although fearful of what would happen, and having long attended a support group for abuse survivors, David finally contacted the police in February 2007. He thought he was doing the right thing. David David An investigating officer, Sergeant Geoff Harrison, came to Davids house to conduct a full interview. The interview would form the basis of Davids police statement, seen by BuzzFeed News, in which he describes, among other things, being raped by Dawson in Dolphin Square. At the time the flats were not publicly linked with sexual abuse, and Harrison, says David, was more concerned with the events in Lincolnshire. I said, Am I the only one? He [Harrison] almost laughed. He said, No, this is huge. Itll be the biggest case this country has ever seen. David says the sergeant informed him the police had been investigating Dawson for nine years; that over 20 people had come forward. The police believed Dawson had been an active paedophile for 45 years, he adds. Geoff told us to expect heavy media intrusion should [the case] go the way they would hope. It did not. Instead, a series of strange events began to occur that has baffled those who have looked at this case. What transpired, according to police documents obtained by BuzzFeed News, is that Harrison had first arrested and questioned Dawson in December 2006, after interviewing five people alleging abuse since that October alone. Dawson denied everything. But when David came forward two months later, having heard a rumour about accusations being made, the police suddenly seemed galvanised into further action, he says, and told him that with his testimony they would rearrest Dawson. Although heartened by this, David had a concern. Dawson kept a large collection of guns in his house, so David says he told the police this and asked them to remove the weapons before they rearrested him. (Officers can apply to the firearms department within their force to approve this.) I said it again and again, Youve got to do this, you cant risk anything happening. When I went to sign my statement I said, Any progress? And Geoff [Harrison] said, No, weve put in a request but unfortunately it was denied. Theyve looked at it and theyve deemed that hes not a risk. David cannot understand how someone in Dawsons position could not be considered a risk. Leading criminal lawyer Nigel Richardson, the author of a textbook on investigating sexual offences, tells BuzzFeed News: These days the police are very careful to at least go through the motions of making sure anyone arrested for a sexual offence is not a danger to themselves. But it was what happened the day after David signed his statement that would form the centre of his criticisms of police conduct. Sgt Harrison rang Dawson to warn him he was going to be rearrested. The details of the call are confirmed in a signed statement from Harrison at the time, which BuzzFeed News has obtained. The document reveals something else: Harrison did the same thing before arresting Dawson for the first time in December, in order to be considerate to his needs. View this image  Matt Tucker / BuzzFeed View this image  Matt Tucker / BuzzFeed This is not standard procedure, says Richardson, the criminal lawyer: For an allegation of this seriousness its pretty unusual. Because the police want the element of surprise they want to be able to capture any evidence. They want those things seized rather than hidden. On the second occasion that Harrison warned Dawson of his impending arrest the call took place at 4:40pm on 23 March 2007. The sergeant arranged a day convenient for Dawson to come in to the police station the following week, and informed him that he would be arrested and questioned. Harrisons statement ends: Dawson did not give me any indication for any cause for concern of his welfare or safety. I just dont understand why they would ring, says David. Why risk it? But there was another aspect to the phone call that would later stagger him. David says Harrison told Dawson who the new witness was: that it was David who had come forward. David adds that he knows this because, he says, the sergeant rang him after phoning Dawson, and told David hed disclosed to Dawson the identity of the latest accuser. Again, Richardson, the criminal lawyer, is very surprised by this: The police dont want to give people too much opportunity to think things through in their head, and at that stage they had no protection for the complainant. David says Harrison told him that Dawson, after being informed who had come forward, did not react well. In Harrisons statement he does not mention informing the suspect from whom the new allegations came. However, a letter from David to Lincolnshire police in 2007 reiterates that he had been told Dawson was informed who it was. Later that day 23 March 2007 a local friend phoned David. He said, Have you heard? David guessed. At 6pm Dawsons wife found his body alongside a rifle in a patch of woodland on their estate. Blood surrounded Dawsons face and head. The postmortem examination, seen by BuzzFeed News, revealed a single shot had entered his skull on the right side of his head. There was no sign anyone else was involved. The police, says David, did not contact him to inform him Dawson had died. For 25 years, David had kept going, sustained by the belief that somehow Dawson would be brought to account. He had won, says David. He doesnt ever have to face questions. Hes got away with it. The case was closed. Harrison, he says, stopped returning his calls. David complained to the police. He says he asked them, rhetorically, if they warn drug dealers when they are about to be arrested. Richardson, the criminal solicitor, tells BuzzFeed News: The police simply wouldnt do that in a drugs case. But when the case was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), it was sent back. Following a freedom of information request by BuzzFeed News, the IPCC said, This was not a matter that warranted our involvement and we were content it could instead be handled by the Lincolnshire police. Because the IPCC refused to look into it, a local chief inspector named Tom Bell, from Lincolnshire polices professional standards department, was tasked with investigating the conduct of officers from his own force. On the day of the inquest in May 2007, which David attended, there were several developments. A member of Davids family, who accompanied him there, told BuzzFeed News there was something interesting about the man representing the Dawson family a man named Philip Odling: that Odling was not only a close friend of the Dawson family but also an old friend of Sgt Harrison. David wonders whether, if this is true, it was right for the officer investigating a suspected serial child abuser to have had a close friend in common with him. When BuzzFeed News asked Lincolnshire police to comment on this, they refused to respond. The coroner recorded an open verdict. No suicide note had been left, and Dawsons wifes statement to the coroner, also seen by BuzzFeed News, reveals: Although my husband was low he was not taking any medication for it and everything seemed to be normal. However, it is believed Dawson took his own life. But there was more. Outside the inquest, says David, Chief Inspector Bell who was conducting the internal police investigation tapped David on the shoulder and introduced himself. He said, Can we have a chat? It appears you might have a case. Ive spoken to the head of firearms, who was completely unaware of the situation, and of Gordon Dawson. As far as Bell was concerned, says David, no request to remove the guns had been made. This left David confused and keen to find out what happened it would mean that despite the potential risk of Dawson turning a gun on himself or others, Harrison did nothing to prevent it and instead told Dawson they were coming for him. BuzzFeed News has asked Lincolnshire police, Harrison, and Bell to explain this but they have declined to do so. He [Bell] said he would be back in touch, says David. But, he adds, I never saw a report. BuzzFeed News made a freedom of information request to Lincolnshire police to retrieve Bells report from his internal investigation. It was denied. David, however, using the Data Protection Act, requested all the files of the Dawson case from Lincolnshire police. The response revealed what happened to Bells report: It has been destroyed. The letter stated this was under Management of Police Information rules, although no specific explanation was offered. Nor did the letter state when the file was destroyed. View this image  Matt Tucker / BuzzFeed Some of the files regarding the original police investigation were made available, however. Although largely redacted, what remained startled David: Some of the allegations against Dawson, which stretch back to 1964, included the sexual abuse of boys as young as 5. The few lines in the files that are still discernible the odd quote from the police interview with Dawson in December 2006, for example are all familiar: boys in his car, country lanes, shooting rabbits, trousers undone. Two capitalised words jump out in the police notes: MODUS OPERANDI. View this image  Matt Tucker / BuzzFeed In March 2015, aware that the Metropolitan police had set up various operational teams to investigate allegations of past sexual abuse by public figures, David decided to try to find out what happened to him one more time and to discover what took place during the Lincolnshire police investigation. It was just three months after the Met had appealed to the public to come forward with information about Dolphin Square. David attended an interview with two officers working within Operation Fairbank, the investigation set up to gather evidence of historical sexual abuse by politicians. Many questions remained for David: Why was Dawson forewarned of his arrest? Why were firearms not removed from his house first? Why did the case close immediately after Dawsons death? And why was he not shown the report from the internal investigation? But there were other questions, too: Why was the information about Dolphin Square David had given to Lincolnshire police in 2007 seemingly not investigated nor passed to the Metropolitan police? Why were many of Dawsons friends, including two men who, David had been told, co-owned the flat with Dawson in Dolphin Square, not interviewed? Why has there never been any attempt to find out who sat with him at those restaurants? David left the interview with the Metropolitan police officers full of optimism. They were very animated, he says. [By] the firearms issues, the investigation that never went anywhere, the fact I was never informed Dawson had died and that a 9-year case just died. They said, Youre right to be concerned. They were very keen to get stuff from Lincolnshire police. They said they would be speaking with Geoff Harrison, requesting the file, and they felt this case had to be reopened. A few days later, one of the officers sent an email to David, which he forwarded to BuzzFeed News along with all correspondence between him and the Metropolitan police. There is nothing further for us to investigate here, it said. The information that we discussed doesnt fall within the remit of [Operation] Fairbank or the Metropolitan Police. Shocked but still determined to find the truth, David emailed back setting out all of his concerns. Towards the end of the email David made a plea: I was systematically abused and raped as a child by men at Dolphin Square. All I want is some credible answers. Keystone / Getty Images Getty Five days later, on 25 March 2015, Detective Sergeant James Townly, a senior officer from Operation Fairbank, responded to Davids questions. We read the email together in the hotel room. Because David does not know exactly who the men at the restaurants were, this is not sufficient for a crime report, writes Townly. But David does know the names of the two men he was told co-owned the Dolphin Square flat with Dawson. BuzzFeed News has discovered that one of these men is still alive and that David had supplied his name to the Metropolitan police. But according to Townly, because this name, and others David has given them who may have information, are not already known to the Met, it wont investigate those either. Every investigation carried out by [the] Operation Fairbank team is examined for links to previous reports or intelligence already held, says the email, adding that Dawson and the two other men are not names that have been mentioned to us as part of Operation Fairbank. David is aghast as he reads this and switches into satire. Bring us the pictures, the videos, and the signed statements and we might look into it, he mocks. Townly continues: It is not feasible for the police to investigate every potential or convicted paedophile for links to others. In an ideal world we would very much like to identify all offenders and identify their links to other paedophiles and networks [but] sadly that does not happen. But criminal lawyer Nigel Richardson is perplexed by this. You would think they would want to track down links if they are pointed out, he says. I cant see why they wouldnt want to do that, if theyve got names and potential links. It seems to me its part of their duty to carry out an investigation into those, at least to rule them out. The police, adds David, are not doing their job. In a further point that may surprise those who have followed the allegations of child abuse surrounding Dolphin Square, Townly states: Dolphin Square as a venue is not being investigated. There are in excess of 1,000 flats at the square all of which could at one point on [sic] other in time being venues for sexual abuse. Townly concludes: Operation Fairbank is responsible for investigating allegations of child abuse involving MPs and uncovering allegations of paedophile rings which primarily involve MPs, adding, The allegations you made previously to Lincolnshire and some of what you have said recently involve neither so there is nothing for the Operation Fairbank team to investigate. Townly then attempted to recall the email some email systems allow the user to stop the message before the recipient can open it. But David had already saved the email. He sits staring at it. I feel Ive been betrayed, he says, softly. It is the story of my life. You dont treat survivors this way the police have still got a lot to learn. When the email from Townly arrived, in March 2015, it was, says David, devastating: The worst time of my life. The fight I had to control the anger was the hardest fight Id ever had. He looks down. I was concerned for my own welfare. View this image  Rebecca Hendin / SWNS for BuzzFeed News When approached by BuzzFeed News, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan police said: Experienced officers working to Detective Sergeant Townly in SOECA [the Mets Sexual Offences, Exploitation, & Child Abuse division] did review the material in this case, including speaking with relevant people. This work was subsequently reviewed by DS Townly. In the absence of new lines of enquiry, substantive allegations made, or further new witnesses, the matter remains closed. David is aghast. Why, he wonders, do the police not try to find out who else abused him and who was at those restaurants? Why cant they at least speak to the people whose names he gave them? What else could be going on here? But for David this was at least a response. When BuzzFeed News puts his allegations and questions to Lincolnshire police, a spokesperson replies 11 days after the deadline: We will not be responding. Tom Bell, now retired, also did not respond to BuzzFeed News request for comment. As BuzzFeed News two-day-long interview with David comes to an end, he falls silent. His arms hang by his side. He looks suddenly childlike and alone. As he sits in the hotel room retreating into himself, the image conjures something he said the previous day: I feel that I am still 15 years old. View this image  David as a teenager. David It invokes too a line from the personal statement he gave to Lincolnshire police in 2006 a picture of the impact of everything that has happened: I went for years without touching anybody or shaking anybodys hand. David has contemplated suicide several times. To live without justice is unbearable, he says. He likens it to an incurable cancer. More than 30 years on, as public focus shifts from survivors to celebrities, and with widespread criticisms of the Met, David still does not know who, apart from Dawson, was responsible. Before we leave, he turns for a moment in his chair to gaze out the window. The sun blazes down on the people below: shoppers, office workers, mothers with buggies. People talk about truth, honesty, and justice as if they are sweets you give away, he says, suddenly still. But they are the three most important things you will ever have.

aS"Dearly beloved Talk about a real gem. You met Pearl on one of those bar trivia nights your buddies keep dragging you to because they think you should get out more. At first you didnt even talk to her much, but as the night went on you couldnt help but notice how brilliant she is. Pearl has it all, shes independent, but makes time for you, leaving you cute little notes and really listening when you have something youre trying to sort out. Shes a great dancer who knows all right ways to make you feel ~good~. She even snorts when she laughs, which totally cracks you up. You two are perfect for each other. Congrats! Oh man, when you met Jessica at the park last spring you thought for sure that she was the one. She knew how to make you smile and even seemed to get along with your parents. Sadly, Jessicas true love isnt you, its the trees. You two were good while you lasted, but when you asked her if she wanted to move-in together and she asked if youd consider living in a hammock strung up in a Birch tree you knew this relationship was doomed. Sorry, but Linda is not the marrying type. Sure youre in love with the way she decorates her house, and damned if youre not intoxicated by the way she smells, but this is a more its-not-you-its-her situation. You see, Linda just doesnt want to be locked down. Her life is all about one word: adventure. Shes has plans to spend her entire life traveling the world, swimming in every hotel pool she can dive into on both sides of the equator, a so shes got no time to commit to you. Bens a lawyer. Bens got a big dick. Ben studied at an Ivy and so did the rest of his family. When it comes to Monopoly, Ben always wins, which sorta bums you out tbh. In fact, you spent your whole relationship with Ben trying to measure up to him, and thats no way to live. Was Ben a great date while he lasted? Sure. But when he got down on one knee and started to say, Will you marry me? you knew you need to be with someone who gives you room to love yourself. Stephens startup raised so much capital from angel investors that he bought you a car. And like, thats great, except he never took the time to ask you what kind of car you might find the most helpful or even what color youd prefer it to be. Thats the kind of guy Steve is, large gestures and grand entrances, but no attention to any of the little things. The things that matter. When Stephen (never Steve) proposed to you on a hot air balloon you knew your answer had to be no. And not just because your fear of heights (which he never bothered to even ask about) was making you nauseous. Mario may just be the best lay of your entire goddamn life. The man is a cowboy, a true-blue, rope-swinging, calf-wrangling cowboy. You met while you were on vacation in Wyoming, some boring ranch getaway your sister dragged you to, but then you saw Mario. He was washing down his horse, his muscles glistening with sweat as he squeezed water from a large sponge. He looked over at you and you almost looked away, but didnt. That week left you saddle sore and smiling, but even you knew it couldnt last. Mario never spoke a word to you, a real strong and silent type, which made it all the more surprising when he offered you his grandmothers engagement ring right before you and your sister headed to the airport. It was tough to say no, but you dont want to live a life of silence in Wyoming. Sorry, Mario. Melissa is a lot of fun, she parties hard, is amazing in bed, and can cook a helluva breakfast quiche. Butshe reads a book every. damn. day. Not just paragraphs, but full on books every day. She cant go to sleep unless shes finished one. It was cute and endearing at first, but after two years of dating, its annoying and there honestly isnt any more room in your small shared apartment for book storage. To make matters worse, she always forgets to return the books to the local library, racking up $2,456 dollars in late fees, on your library card! One afternoon, as she flips the final page, she slams her book shut and sternly says, when are you going to marry me?!?! You pause for a moment, pondering whether shes serious or not. She looks serious You say, whenever you want, whenever (not really seriously) and she jumps up, orders an Uber and before you know it youre at the justice of the peace. Enjoy that library bill and the mountain of books! You met Jayne at AA several years ago, you developed a close bond because of the shared connection of getting off the bottle. After a year you both begin to date. She just really gets you, you know? She understands the struggle, doesnt make fun of you, and especially isnt petty when it comes to you constantly leaving the toilet seat up. One day while on a scenic stroll through the neighborhood, the sun begins to set. Youve been waiting for the right time to pop the question. Jayne immediately exclaims, yes! She fumbles with her coffee cup and accidentally drops it, spilling at your feet. Within seconds you smell the pungent odor of whiskey! Horrified you look her in the eyes and notice an emptiness that you never saw before. You snatch the ring back and run away, hot tears streaming down your cheeks. Bummer. Sorry. Try again. Juanita works out twice a day. The first, a sunrise 5 am pilates class and again at a 7 pm Barrys Bootcamp class. Her body is in tip top shape but literally you never see her even though you both live together. Plus if you have to drink one more avocado, kale, pumpkin seed smoothie (her favorite meal) you might go crazy. Sex with her is great because shes so flexible, but theres a spark missing from the relationship.  One night at dinner she gets on a knee and a large rectangular box appears out of thin air. She unrolls a 24-karat gold knit yoga mat and presents it to you, a symbol of her commitment. You hesitate and she realizes, immediately angry, she rolls up the mat and storms off mumbling something about how, youll never be a downward facing dog. Pick again. Wow. When you first began dating Enrique, you were very, very skeptical. Youve never dated a perfect 10 before. He really likes you and you try every day to forget about that one-time he cheated on you. It was a mistake he swears and he was really, really drunk. The sex is amazing, so you kind of dont want to let him go and plus its been months and your trust has began to grow back.  On a vacation to the Bahamas, Enrique gets down on one knee and your blood immediately begins to pump. Your heart in your throat, you patiently wait for the words, will you marry me, to leave his lips. He quickly jumps up from tying his shoe and your face goes beet red. You try to play it off but you cant lie you definitely dodged a bullet right there. Pick again. Cliff is once divorced. He has two children, a boy and a girl. Theyre both grown now so you dont have to worry much about parenting. Cliff owns his own home, likes to travel to exotic new places and honestly is a monster catch. The only negative is his pre-mature ejaculation but apparently that can be treated so it isnt THAT much of a factor. If you love a cushy life, with a guy that genuinely loves you and worships the ground you walk on, then youve made a very, very, wise choice. If shallow better suits you (seriously, no offense taken) try again. Henrick hails from Sweden. He has an infectious smile and a promising career. When you first met, he had just moved to your town and has had his fair share of relationships. Despite his experience, hes never been married before. After a year of dating, he pops the question. He feels like its been long enough. You hesitate because you remember last Christmas when he got too drunk and threw up in your moms hydrangea. She never liked him much after that. You pause briefly to consider his proposal after a few moments you lift him up from his bended knee kiss him on the forehead and walk off into the sunset, never to see him again. Pick another.

aS"This year on the festival circuit, many queer films are probing the experiences of young people, with storylines that include transitioning, falling in love, and just plain growing up. Here are three of the best. View this image  Gotafilm Based on the acclaimed Swedish young adult novel by Jessica Schiefauer, Girls Lost is a story of gender navigation and sexual awakening, infused with a healthy dose of supernatural strangeness. Three teenagers who are viciously bullied in school Momo (Louise Nyvall), Bella (Wilma Holmen), and Kim (Tuva Jagell) take refuge from their cruel classmates in Bellas greenhouse, which belonged to her late mother. When Bella is sent a mysterious seed by mistake, she plants it; the next morning, shes surprised to discover that it has bloomed into a large black flower overnight. Later, after a particularly rough day at school, the group of best friends decide to drink the flowers juice, hoping it will give them powers to ward off their persecutors. They fall asleep and when they wake, they find that their bodies have been transformed into those of boys. The film is beautifully shot, warmed by rich, deep colors, with the fluid movements of a waking dream. Giddy moments immediately following the played-for-laughs body swap scene are among the prettiest: Momo, Bella, and Kim now played by Alexander Gustavsson, Vilgot Ostwald Vesterlund, and Emrik hlander, respectively; all uncanny casting choices for the girls male counterparts rush outside and take to their bikes, urged to put their new limbs to use. The teenagers are delighted to find theyve been newly endowed with penises, muscles, and the male privilege that allows them to float through other boys spaces without being called sluts and whores. They speed joyfully through the Swedish night, momentarily freed from the social and physical oppressions of girlhood. But, in an appropriately werewolfian twist, the spell only lasts til morning. View this image  Gotafilm For Momo and Bella, their flirtation with magic is a lark, a romp they go to school the next day, back in girls bodies, though with leftover bravado from their few hours of boyishness. But for Kim the transformation offers something entirely different. Already tomboyish in his female-assigned body, he experiences his new boys body as an extension of his deepest, truest self. But it took the physical metamorphosis for him to realize this truth in full. By night, the teenagers continue to drink the flowers magic serum, though as Kims enthusiasm waxes, Momo and Bellas inevitably wanes. In boy bodies, they start hanging out with a petty thief who goes to their school, Tony (Mandus Berg), and his ragtag crew; Kim becomes enamored with him and his rough, boozy lifestyle, which Momo and Bella view as a betrayal of their core friendship. The tender push and pull of teenage affections, articulated by across-the-board powerful performances, is one of the films greatest strengths especially where those affections are complicated, as they always are in real life (albeit less magically so), by sexuality and gender. As Kim tumbles after Tony, participating blindly in his thieving escapades, its clear that Kim is trying to parse whether his attraction to Tony is aspirational (Tony is the boy Kim wants to be) or romantic (Tony is the boy Kim wants to kiss), or a breathless mix of the two. Meanwhile, Momo is wrestling with her attraction to Kim, though she cant quite tell whether she should love him in his boy version or girl version, nor what form she herself should take so that he might love her back. The films plotting starts to unravel toward the end, in a third act which feels indulgently long and a bit too concerned with trans male aggression. The flower Kims using for his nightly transformations withers more and more each time its tapped for juice; as his need to live in boy form grows more acute, the flower grows ever closer to death. The final scenes reveal an uncomfortable collision between the films magical realism and the real-world implications of Kims tragic inability to sustain the flowers power forever, as much as he fights to save it. In the slippery space created between the the fantastical elements of body-swapping and the films grounding in the physical immediacy of sex, drugs, and teenage cruelty, Girls Lost makes no room for Kim to consider the life-saving possibilities of hormones and gender affirmation surgery someday and so, when magic abandons him, he has nowhere to turn. A disconcertingly ambiguous ending aside, Girls Lost is a wholly original take on trans teenagedom, resplendently packaged and populated with characters worth fighting for. View this image  Gotafilm Where you can see it: Girls Lost will be streamed in the U.S. and Canada through Wolfe Releasing later this year. View this image  Lama Films When Michal Vinik set out to make her debut feature, the casting took her months. For her film about queer teenage girls, Barash, she was seeking non-actor, real-life lesbians. (She ended up finding one of them, Jade Sakori who plays party-girl love interest Hershko on the street, walking arm in arm with her girlfriend.) I was seeking a certain truth I didnt see other places, Vinik said at a Q&A after Barashs screening at BFI Flare in March. I love Cate Blanchett kissing anybody, thats OK with me, she joked, referencing last years much-beloved Carol, which starred Blanchett and Rooney Mara, two straight actors. But I was looking for something different. Barashs 17-year-old titular character, Naama Barash (Sivan Noam Shimon), tries to escape being embroiled in her familys drama by tossing herself more aggressively into the Tel Aviv nightlife. She and her friends loiter outside of cars in parking lots, waiting for boys to offer them drugs and alcohol. Its only when the new girl in school the pretty, bottle-blonde Hershko, whose drawn-on left eyebrow is always a different bright color starts accompanying Naama and her friends on exploits that their partying options vibrantly expand before them. View this image  Lama Films In many ways, Barash follows the well-worn path of a lesbian coming-of-age drama: a moody, almost-not-quite-rebellious teen girl is searching for something different; then a new, edgy, experienced queer girl comes to town and starts seriously messing with her heart. But Barash manages to set itself apart from the pack, in part because it has sociopolitical conflict as its backdrop. While Naama is slipping out of class to party, theres a worry lodged at the back of her mind: Her older sister, Liora (Bar Ben Vakil), has gone missing, seemingly having abandoned her post with the Israeli army. Their father, Gidon (Dvir Benedek), drags Naama along on searches. Soon, the family learns that Liora might have run off with a Palestinian boy. As Naama navigates her budding queerness, her presumed sexual deviance parallels that of her missing sister, whose absence hangs over every sad family barbecue, every pulsating, breathless club scene. At the BFI Flare Q&A, director and writer Vinik said that she wasnt an out lesbian teenager so the film, for her, was a chance to rewrite my own history. Nowhere in the film is that revision more apparent than in a fabulous sequence where Naama and Liora are lounging outside school, casually discussing which girls theyd like to sleep with. Hot girls, it seems, are everywhere: hugging their friends, smoking cigarettes, drifting down stairwells, all in languid, sexy slow-mo from Naama and Lioras perspective. So many girls here need us to show them the light, says Liora. For everyone who didnt come out until college or beyond, its a reimagining of what high school might have been like as a playground of queer possibility. And theres a remarkably well-done sex scene, too, long and slow, sun-drenched and buzzing with excited tension. Naamas gobsmacked face when walking home from her first lesbian sexual encounter drew laughs from an audience familiar with exactly that experience: the thrill, the wonder, the knowledge that your life has been forever changed. Though the plot fizzles a little by the end, Barash feels exactly like a movie made by and with lesbians in the best way authentic, queer, feminine, exuberant. View this image  Lama Films Where you can see it: Barash is being distributed as Blush in the U.S. by Film Movement. It will screen at Outfest in Los Angeles in July 2016. Keep up with additional showtimes and festival releases here. View this image  Vivo Film To escape a life of female subservience in the remote mountain villages of northern Albania, some women and girls make a choice: to swear eternal celibacy, in exchange for the right to dress and live as men. For her debut feature, director Laura Bispuri teamed up with co-writer Francesca Manieri to adapt a novel by Elvira Dones in order to probe this phenomenon, bringing the story to life with Hana (whose adult self is deftly and remarkably performed by Alba Rohrwacher). As a child, Hana is plucked from the ravages of a winter storm responsible for killing her parents and delivered to safety by Gjergj (Bruno Shllaku), who then raises her as his own. Gjergj has a daughter, Lila (Flonja Kodheli), with whom Hana navigates preteen life in their tiny, tradition-steeped village. Gorgeous tracking shots show the girls now sisters running through the frozen white and gray swirl of Albania in bright knitted sweaters, their long hair streaming behind them. In one harrowing scene, Hana and Lila are carrying laundry home with their mother when they pass a group of men leading a woman on horseback; the woman is covered head to toe in a white veil. The girls learn that shes a bride being delivered to her groom her face is covered so that she cant see how to escape and return home. The bride is a ghostly physical manifestation of life for women here: As Hana and Lila get older, they grow ever closer to being sent away and forced into early arranged marriages, after which theyll be expected to perform strictly servile roles. The girls, now teenagers, choose two different paths to evade their fate: Lila runs off to Italy to marry for love instead of duty, while Hana who has been learning how to shoot rifles under Gjergjs gruff instruction stays behind. Im nothing outside of these mountains, she tells Lila, declining her sisters plea to come with her. In order to retain the masculine-coded freedoms shed been attempting to earn, Hana takes the vow of burrnesha, becoming a sworn virgin. The film progresses along two linear storylines, their past intercut with scenes of their present. Now grown adults, Lila has settled in Milan, while Hana is living as a man named Mark in Albania. But for Mark, even the masculine pleasures of independent living, alcohol consumption, and rifle wielding arent enough to justify the progression of life in his remote village. Gjergj, the father figure to whom he owes his rewritten life, died long ago. Hes lonely. Over a decade after seeing Lila for the last time, he sets out for Milan taking a barge across an icy blue lake which reflects the looming Albanian mountains above, in a head-spinningly beautiful long take to find her. View this image  Vivo Film Sworn Virgin is about being caught in between: Hana/Mark exists in flux, floating between genders and countries. The film eschews any sort of easy trans narrative: Mark, while having grown into his manhood in many ways, is also ever more drawn to certain aspects of the femininity and sexuality hed long ago forsworn. Lila, after at first being rattled by his sudden reappearance in her life, takes him into her home and begins helping him navigate a path toward an improvised new womanhood. Late at night, when neither are able to sleep, they camp out in the kitchen and whisper about sex which Mark is still a stranger to finding the secretive intimacy of sisters anew. Some of the films loveliest moments occur between Mark and Lilas teenage daughter, Jonida (Emily Ferratello), a surly synchronized swimmer who resents Mark for suddenly crashing into her world; she knows and cares little about the Albania her mother left behind. Mark, against Jonidas protestations, begins picking her up from her swim lessons, at a bustling pool set in dreamy, blue-washed tableaus. Lithe teenage bodies in colorful bathing suits and heavily shellacked makeup twirl around Mark while he watches them practice, every girl a physical representation of the kind of girlhood neither Lila nor Hana had been afforded. Jonida can understand Albanian but refuses to speak it, instead drowning Mark in ceaseless Italian he can barely parse, leaving them to communicate mostly in gesture. Mark carries Jonidas backpack for her. Jonida holds a new bra up to Marks chest once shes begun warming to him, suggesting he could really pull it off. Jonidas brash, mouthy girlishness sweeps up against Marks hesitant masculine stoicism, and he begins to find his way back to Hana. At once a story of the way girls can be twisted into terribly limiting roles and a story of how different kinds of girls can cope, and flourish, in full spite of those limits, Sworn Virgin is as visually captivating as it is warm, precise, and intimate. View this image  Vivo Film Where you can see it: Sworn Virgin is currently open in limited release. Its also worth checking out these other films featuring young LGBT characters currently floating around the festival circuit, all of which screened at BFI Flare: Henry Gambles Birthday Party, about a Christian teenager discovering his sexuality amidst a bustling celebration of his 17th birthday; Naz & Maalik, about two closeted Muslim teens in Brooklyn being watched by the FBI; and Closet Monster, a coming-of-age-tale featuring a talking hamster voiced by Isabella Rossellini.

Scott is into his bears and although he tops occasionally, hed prefer to be laid spreadeagled in his sling. People are always surprised that Paul is a bottom, but why? So hes 63, doesnt mean he doesnt enjoy a dick in the butt. Chris is a top. No two ways about it. Nothing will go near his back door at all, ever. He wouldnt even let you go near his ass with a pinky finger. But at least youve found the last remaining top left in the world. Lloyd is a platinum bottom. Hes never topped anything in his life, and hes happy that way. Aidan was an exclusive top until he fell in love with another exclusive top. Aidan loves his man so much, he became a power bottom overnight. Thats true love! Phil is a raging bottom. He has a massive dick, but its just for decoration because it never gets used. James likes to switch it up, but at the minute hes living out his bottom destiny. He might return to topping soon, but dont count on it. Josh topped once, when he was 19, but he didnt see what all the fuss was about. Then he found bottoming and he hasnt looked back since. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The federal government could seek a court order to gain compliance, an official with the department told BuzzFeed News. View this image  U.S. Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta. AP Tony Dejak / AP The Justice Department on Wednesday warned North Carolinas governor that a recent anti-LGBT state law violates federal civil rights laws. The state is engaging in a pattern or practice of discrimination against transgender state employees, U.S. Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta wrote in a letter to Gov. Pat McCrory. Known as HB2, the law bans transgender people access to restrooms that match their gender identity in government buildings and schools, and in doing so, violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, she added. Gupta gave McCrory until May 9 to bring North Carolina back into compliance. The governor responded in a statement Wednesday night, saying that the Obama administration has not only staked out its position for North Carolina, but for all states, universities and most employers in the U.S. The right and expectation of privacy in one of the most private areas of our personal lives is now in jeopardy. McCrory, who has repeatedly claimed that transgender people pose a threat in womens restrooms, added, We will be reviewing to determine the next steps. The law passed in March has faced widespread backlash from businesses and entertainers, and has triggered demonstrations from critics who say it protects those who engage in discrimination. View this image  Jason E. Miczek / AP Federal law prohibits workplace discrimination on the basis of sex. And both courts and the federal agency that enforces civil rights laws in the workplace have held Title VII also bans transgender discrimination, Gupta noted. With HB2, she said, McCrory and North Carolina are engaging in a pattern or practice of resistance to transgender employees of public agencies fully enjoy their Title VII rights. Access to sex-segregated restrooms and other workplace facilities consistent with gender identity is a term, condition, or privilege of employment, Gupta wrote. Denying such access to transgender individuals, whose gender identity is different from the gender assigned at birth, while affording it to similarly situated non-transgender employees, violates Title VII. Further, the Education Department has interpreted Title IX of the Education Act of 1972 which bans sex discrimination to protect transgender students restroom access rights. And Gupta noted that a federal appeals court recently recognized the departments authority to make that interpretation. Gupta is asking for confirmation that North Carolina state agencies will not comply with or implement HB2. An official with the Department of Justice, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, told BuzzFeed News the agency hopes North Carolina complies voluntarily. The DOJ prefers that states receiving federal funding will comply with U.S. law on their own so they can continue to receive the money. However, if the state does not comply, Attorney General Loretta Lynch could seek a court order to force compliance, Gupta noted. View this embed  5.

aS"The ordinance was the most far-reaching law of its type in the county and drew threats of legal action. View this image  Via youtube.com Facing uncommon national scrutiny, the city council of Oxford, Alabama, convened a special meeting on Wednesday to recall an ordinance that banned transgender people from public restrooms including in restaurants, stores, theaters that match their gender. The council voted 3-2 to repeal the policy it passed last week. It was the most far-reaching law of its type in the county, and drew threats of legal action. The council chamber was standing room only on Wednesday, with supporters of the law appearing to slightly outnumber opponents, sources present at the meeting told BuzzFeed News. The council had called the special meeting on Tuesday, after the ACLU announced it was considering suing the city. The policy which would punish violators with up to six months in jail alarmed LGBT advocates due to the wide range of venues it affected and the criminal punishments. Both the ACLU and Southern Poverty Law Center sent the city council a stern letter warning of the citys legal liability, arguing the law violated the 14th Amendment and civil rights laws that ban discrimination based on sex. The rule was aimed a Target among the largest of the citys retailers which announced a transgender-friendly restroom policy last month. Christian conservatives and legal groups have argued such policies would allow transgender women, whom they call men, to prey on women in restrooms. The Oxford City Council did the right thing by recalling its discriminatory ordinance, said Chinyere Ezie, staff attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center. We are pleased the council members came to the conclusion that nobody should be criminalized simply for using the restroom. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Theyre all gay but only one of them is right for you. Joe will take you out on a couple dates and then claim exclusivity, but in reality hes still on Grindr looking for NSA fun. Marcus claims that hes actually straight and just enjoys oral fun with guys. No matter how many times you tell him thats a little bit gay, it wont make an ounce of difference. Olivers a great guy but theres just one small problem: he doesnt douche. Douchings not for everybody, but he doesnt even use a wet wipe to clean up back there. After one accident too many and spoiling your best sheets, its best you move on to cleaner pastures. Jack says hes vers and makes out that he can top or bottom at the drop of a hat. But in realty, Jack is a strict top that wont let you anywhere near his butt. Thats OK, but its also false advertising. You started sexting Liam and he told you that his dick was 9 whole inches. You were impressed, until you finally met him and realised its closer to 5. Its not the size that matters, its the lies and deceit! On Aarons Grindr profile, he said he was 63. But when you decide to meet him for a coffee, he turns out to be 59 and if he can lie about his height, what else will he lie about in the future? Stephen is strictly Masc4Masc which means no more watching RuPaul. Nobody is worth that sacrifice. Youll say hey to Connor on Grindr and hell reply immediately, getting you all excited. Youll ask him how he is, and hell tell you hes just got back from the gym and is kind of horny. Thats when the penny drops: Connors not even a real person, hes just another Grindr bot. Callum is the perfect choice: hes handsome, hes attentive, hes romantic, not to mention hes great in bed. He really is the whole package. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Exclusive: The letter was sent to David Bulmer-Rizzi, who had died on honeymoon, but was automatically forwarded to his grieving widower. They dont realise theres a human side to this, Marco Bulmer-Rizzi told BuzzFeed News. View this image  David (left) and Marco Bulmer-Rizzi Bulmer-Rizzi The Australian immigration department has written to a dead British man to tell him he has outstayed his visa. The email entitled OVERSTAYER arrived on Wednesday in the inbox of the mans grieving husband, who had set up an automatic forwarding system to deal with his partners correspondences. David Bulmer-Rizzi died suddenly in an accident while on honeymoon in Adelaide in January. A week later, his husband, Marco Bulmer-Rizzi, travelled back to Britain with Davids ashes after informing the authorities in Australia of the death. At first I thought it was a joke, Bulmer-Rizzi told BuzzFeed News. I had to check the reference number [in the email] from when we applied for the visa to make sure it was real. you are now in Australia without a valid visa the email said, warning, It is very important you visit your nearest DIPS [Department of Immigration and Border Protection] office as soon as possible Im speechless, said Bulmer-Rizzi. Its inappropriate, insensitive, and avoidable. Bulmer-Rizzi The email follows a catalogue of humiliations for Bulmer-Rizzi, who was told shortly after his husbands death that because South Australia does not recognise overseas same-sex marriages, the death certificate would read never married and because Bulmer-Rizzi was therefore not considered the next of kin, all decisions relating to the death and funeral had to be approved by his father-in-law. The case sparked an international outcry as the story, revealed by BuzzFeed News, went viral across the globe, prompting Jay Weatherill, the premier of South Australia, to personally intervene, telephoning Bulmer-Rizzi to apologise and promising both a new death certificate and a change of the law this year to recognise foreign gay marriages. The indignities continued, however, when Bulmer-Rizzi attempted to travel back to Britain. Immigration officials in Hong Kong where same-sex marriage is also not recognised stopped him and attempted to confiscate the ashes, as they did not deem Bulmer-Rizzi the next of kin. But the email from the Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection was, he said, the final straw and exposes flaws in the already widely criticised Australian immigration system. View this image  ABC I handed Davids passport to immigration when leaving Australia and on my return to the UK because I wanted David to be recorded as being in the UK with me again, he said. I know for a fact they [UK immigration] swiped his passport at Heathrow because the official said to me, Welcome home both [of you]. Bulmer-Rizzi remembers this, he said, because the brief exchange made him cry. He was carrying Davids ashes in order that they could at least be together on the journey home. However, he said, Obviously they [the Australian officials] didnt record the fact that I had handed over Davids passport when I left Australia. And the South Australia register office that issued me Davids interim death certificate should have told immigration. The South Australia government should have some sort of information sharing system with immigration. Or someone at the airport should have said, This is what you need to do. Bulmer-Rizzi has written to the office of the South Australia premier to inform it of his predicament, and to ask for its help in the matter. It is not, he said, simply a matter of insensitivity. View this image  Bulmer-Rizzi Davids visa application is linked together with mine because we applied together, and we share the same surname and address and I dont know how that would play out when I go back to Australia later in the year, he said, adding that most of all what distresses him is the thought of another injustice, of his husbands name erroneously being on a list of illegal immigrants. He has one final concern regarding the email, an echo of what happened in January when his marriage was not recognised. Im terrified they [Australian immigration] are going to ask me to fill out a form asking for my relationship status who I am in relation to David. The denial, yet again, of his relationship is too much for him, he said: They dont realise theres a human side to this. I cant deal with it. I cannot grieve, I cant even try to focus on the fact Ive lost David, because Im bombarded with bullshit, with endless letters, emails red tape. Bulmer-Rizzi said he simply wants to be left alone to grieve. And, he said, I want them to remove Davids name from that list. Thats it.  UPDATE Following the publication of this story, a spokesperson from the Department of Immigration and Border Protection told BuzzFeed News: Officials from the Department of Immigration and Border Protection have written to Mr Marco Bulmer-Rizzi to apologise for any distress caused by correspondence sent to his late husband. Officials have also offered to discuss the matter personally with Mr Bulmer-Rizzi if he wishes...The Department makes extensive efforts to match its records with facts of death files from state and territory authorities and with its own records on repatriated bodies. The Department will examine the circumstances of this case in an effort to identify ways to further improve its processes. The Department sincerely regrets any distress caused to the family and loved ones of Mr Bulmer-Rizzi. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .

aS"Some procedures have been cancelled as doctors look for alternate facilities. View this image  A fire was set at Centre Mtropolitain de Chirurgie in Montreal at 8:45 p.m., police told BuzzFeed Canada. While the sprinkler system stopped the fire from spreading, TVA reports the water and smoke caused several hundred thousand dollars of damage. No injuries were reported and police are now seeking a man in connection with the blaze. The cosmetic surgery clinic is home to Canadas only doctor performing more complex gender-affirming surgeries like vaginoplasty and phalloplasty. Led by Dr. Pierre Brassard, transgender patients from across the country are referred to the clinic. With wait times already spanning years and thats after the wait for a referral theres concern the fire damage could make the situation even worse. Dr. Brassards office declined to comment on how patients could be affected, but transgender Canadians and their allies are concerned about the potential impact and motivations. and now every trans person in Canada waiting for surgeries just had their clinic set on fire. Delays will be awful because of this will there be a national outcry? The only surgeon in Canada working with trans people has their clinic targeted by arson. This clinic is the ONLY one that takes OHIP funding for most trans surgeries. It's a much bigger story than you are reporting. @mtlgazette Montreal police spokesperson Manuel Couture told BuzzFeed Canada the case has not been transferred to the hate crimes unit. Be assured that if we have any information or any doubt, it will be transferred to our hate crimes unit, said Couture. Whatever the motive, it shows how few resources are available to transgender Canadians seeking surgery. Regardless of the reason why, there is definitely an impact on trans folks who are looking for gender affirming surgeries, said Gabrielle Bouchard, trans advocacy coordinator for the Centre for Gender Advocacy in Montreal. Bouchard told BuzzFeed Canada its not surprising that a single clinic holds such significance given the lack of doctors trained in gender-affirming surgeries. But its the people currently waiting for their surgery date who may be affected most. Imagine if you have to wait up to two years to get authorization, said Bouchard. Then the only clinic that is able to do so goes up in flames. Trans Canadians in distress can reach out to Trans Lifeline at (877) 330-6366. Surgeries scheduled between May 3 and May 6 have been cancelled as the clinic works to repair the damage. While these repairs are taking place, the CMC has taken steps to temporarily transfer its activities in order to avoid surgery cancellations and delays for its clients, said the statement. They also said employees are clients will be informed of further developments. In the mean time, the clinic is working with authorities investigating the cause of the fire and additional security measures have been put in place. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The ACLU had suggested it may sue the city of Oxford. View this image  Via youtube.com The city council in Oxford, Alabama which drew threats of a lawsuit by passing the most extreme anti-transgender restroom ordinance in the country last week will meet Wednesday to consider potentially repealing the policy. Kristi Durham, an aide to the cityclerk, told BuzzFeed News that the council requested a special call meeting to discuss potentially recalling the ordinance. This is a positive sign. Its clear they have been getting a lot more reaction than they anticipated, Randall Marshal, legal director of the ACLU of Alabama, told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday afternoon. As BuzzFeed News reported last week, the ACLU has been weighing a possible lawsuit against the city, saying the ordinance may raise constitutional and civil rights concerns. The policy would ban transgender people from using any public restrooms that match their gender identity including in restaurants, theaters, and other businesses open to the public and would punish violators with up to six months in jail or a $500 fine. No other city or state in the country has passed such a bill. However, City Clerk Shirley Henson told BuzzFeed News that the bill has not actually become law. Its still pending, she said, explaining that it requires the mayors signature, which she has not yet received. But Henson was uncertain about procedure for enacting the ordinance. She did not know if it could be enacted without the mayors signature whether, for example, it would become law automatically after a certain time frame if it were not vetoed. The Oxford mayor, police chief, and five council members did not responded to repeated calls and emails from BuzzFeed News asking about the ordinance or how it could be enforced in the past past week. As the Anniston Star reported, the Oxford City Council was reacting to an announcement from the retailer Target which has a store in the city to let customers use restrooms corresponding with their gender identity. Council President Steven Waits said he was acting not out of concerns for the 0.3 percent of the population who identify as transgender, but to protect our women and children. However, in 17 states and more than 200 cities that protect transgender people in public facilities, there are no documented cases of nondiscrimination laws being used to promote or defend predatory behavior in restrooms. The Oxford ordinance would make it a crime for a person to utilize a multiple occupancy facility designated for use by the opposite biological sex. It defines biological sex as the physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a persons birth certificate. Marshal, who hopes the council repeals the ordinance, said he believe officials are reacting to concerns that the city would wind up being in the business of monitoring bathrooms.

aS"Michael Merichko was arrested and charged in Illinois for creating a disturbance to protest Targets policy on transgender peoples use of bathrooms. View this image  An active shooter situation at a Target store in Illinois Monday turned out to be a man creating a disturbance over the retail chains policy on transgender people using bathrooms, authorities said. Michael Merichko, 39, was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct after he caused a disturbance inside the store while protesting Targets policy on transgender bathrooms, the Bradley Police Department said in a press release. On Monday afternoon, police responded to a 911 call reporting an active shooter inside the store in the village of Bradley. Local police along with several other jurisdictions reported to the scene. There were no shots fired and no weapons recovered at the scene, police said. They confronted Merichko outside the store and took him into custody without incident. Investigators said he did not make threats of shooting anyone in the store. Authorities are looking into why the 911 call reported an active shooter. Merichkos actions provoked a breach of peace causing panic among store employees and customers, police said. View this image  On April 19, Target posted a statement on its website to take a stand in the recent debate around inclusivity sparked by a spate of anti-LGBT laws in states such as Mississippi and North Carolina which ban transgender people from using certain restrooms. We welcome transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity, Target said in its statement. We believe that everyoneevery team member, every guest, and every communitydeserves to be protected from discrimination, and treated equally. Since the announcement, more than a million people have signed a petition by the American Family Association (AFA) calling for a boycott of Target for its bathroom policy. Targets policy is exactly how sexual predators get access to their victims, the petition said. View this embed  In a nearly 14-minute Facebook video posted on April 25, Merichko appears to describe another similar encounter at Target where police officers were called after he asked an employee about the new bathroom law. Heres the concern, Merichko says he told the Target employee after she explained that Target welcomes transgender employees and guests to use the restroom that corresponds with their gender identity. I am a husband, and I am a father. And I have a wife and a daughter. I do not want some wicked pervert in the same bathroom as my wife or my daughter, someone who self-identifies at that time as woman. Thats a problem, dont you think, Merichko says he told the employee. Merichko says that he was walking around the Target store holding his Bible and reading and memorizing scriptures to himself. He says that after police officers questioned him he told them that he disapproved of Targets transgender bathroom law and that the Bible 110% disagreed with this so-called law. He says that he would go in the bathroom with his wife and daughter and stand guard to prevent some wicked pervert from laying a hand on them.

aS"Mississippi was the last state in the nation that prohibited adoption by gay couples, so, in all 50 states, gay couples are allowed to adopt kids as it should be, Roberta Kaplan, lead lawyer in the case, told BuzzFeed News. View this image  Roberta Kaplan AP / Emily Wagster Pettus A deadline passed at midnight Tuesday for Mississippi officials to appeal a federal court ruling that found the states law banning adoption by same-sex couples was unconstitutional. By failing to continue defending the law, it is effectively dead. Mississippi was the last state in the nation that prohibited adoption by gay couples, so in all 50 states, gay couples are allowed to adopt kids, as it should be, Roberta Kaplan, lead lawyer in the case, told BuzzFeed News. As far as the state is concerned, gay couples and their kids cant be treated differently than anyone else. It is the latest judicial reverberation of the U.S. Supreme Courts 2015 ruling that struck down state bans on same-sex couples marriages. In March, U.S. District Court Judge Daniel P. Jordan III granted a preliminary injunction that blocked the Mississippis Department of Human Services from enforcing the adoption ban. In his decision, Jordan cited the high courts ruling on marriage, writing, The majority of the United States Supreme Court dictates the law of the land, and lower courts are bound to follow it In this case, that means that [the adoption ban] violates the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. Susan Hrostowski, one of the plaintiffs in the case along with her wife, Kathryn Garner, told BuzzFeed News, Ive been waiting 16 years to be able to adopt my son, so Im overjoyed about that. The couple and son plan to see a judge Friday. Im hoping the judge will just do it right there, she said. But not purely celebratory, Hrostowski was also frustrated that top state officials defended the ban so long, even after the Supreme Courts marriage ruling last June. She said the ban like a Mississippi law that protects people with religious objections to same-sex marriage was meant to distract from the states poor economy and weakening infrastructure. They make the heterosexuals feel superior to the LGBT people, and then the public wont mind when they are dismantling the rest of the state, she said of the governor and legislative leaders. She also took umbrage with religious arguments against gays and lesbians being used to justify the adoption ban. A goodly number of Christians are tired of being painted with that brush, so were standing up, said Hrostowski, who is also an Episcopal priest. Kaplan, who also litigated the landmark case that resulted in the end of the Defense of Marriage Act, said that she and lawyers for the state may submit a formal request asking the court to convert Marchs preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction against enforcing the adoption ban. The lawsuit was brought by the Campaign for Southern Equality and the Family Equality Council, along with several same-sex couples trying to adopt through the foster care system or private adoptions. There are a lot of children in the foster care system, and children in shelters, who need good, loving homes, said Hrostowski. There are many gay and lesbians who could be their parents. Research has shown time and time again we make fine parents. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"In a shift of tactics, a national LGBT group is putting a transgender man front and center in its new commercial criticizing North Carolinas anti-LGBT law. View this image  Freedom for All Americans / Via youtube.com In a shift of tactics, a national LGBT groups new commercial features a transgender man front and center in a 60-second spot criticizing North Carolinas law that says people can only use restrooms in government buildings that reflect their birth sex. It focuses on Zeke Christopoulos, a transgender man who discusses his gender transition with two colleagues and decries the law that mandates he use the womens restroom. Matt McTighe, executive director of Freedom for All Americans, which produced the commercial, told BuzzFeed News on Monday, This is clearly a piece that has been missing. We need to humanize this issue, and to educate people on who transgender people really are. It shows a different approach, he added. View this image  Via youtube.com National LGBT groups have had an incoherent strategy for representing transgender people in heated policy debates even when transgender people and their rights are at the very crosshairs of criticism. Specifically, LGBT advocates have faced blistering attacks arguing that if LGBT discrimination were banned letting transgender people use restrooms corresponding to their gender identity they will prey on women in public restrooms. Last fall in Houston, the specter of men in womens bathrooms was the driving force of an effort to repeal the citys LGBT nondiscrimination ordinance. That attack continued through this weekend, when Ted Cruz criticized those who think grown men should be allowed to use the little girls restroom. But LGBT groups largely avoided talking about transgender people or restrooms in Houston, instead pivoting to broad themes in their TV ads about fairness there particularly about veterans. The LGBT campaign in Houston, which was backed by the Human Rights Campaign and Freedom for All Americans, lost in a landslide. Now with the transgender bathroom argument getting national attention in the wake of the North Carolina law McTighe believes that an evolution, not a shift of tactics requires confronting the oppositions messages more directly. That involves putting transgender people in mass-media campaigns and attempting to reframe the issue from there. View this image  Via youtube.com Appearing alongside Christopoulos, Patricia Hickling Beckham notes she was briefly uncomfortable when she learned Christopoulos was transgender. But she then notes the paradox of a law forcing him to use the womens restroom. A law that forces Zeke to use the womens restroom is totally inappropriate, Beckham says in the ad, which does not specifically address the issue of predators in restrooms. McTighe expects the spot to run on cable starting next week, part of an effort to influence North Carolina lawmakers and the general public during the current legislative session. View this image  Via youtube.com Like other Republican leaders in the state capitol, Gov. Pat McCrory has consistently referred to transgender women as men who pose a threat in public restrooms. However, in 17 states and more than 200 cities that protect transgender people in public facilities, there are no documented cases of nondiscrimination laws being used to promote or defend predatory behavior in restrooms. McTighe said that the ad is based on research conducted in focus groups and online audiences last fall. The organization found people were inclined to support LGBT rights after seeing transgender people with co-workers. View this image  In Zekes case, he is a transgender man he is a man and its clear what bathroom he should be using, McTighe said. And the flip side of this law in North Carolina is that it would force him to use the womens bathroom. Its absurd, not to mention has enforceability problems. Much like same-sex marriage advocates found they could counteract criticism about gay lifestyles being taught in schools with narratives about loving couples, he said, campaigns for LGBT nondiscrimination are slowly figuring out messages to respond to attacks over transgender women in womens bathrooms. We needed an additional way to frame this issue that is more personal and more powerful than the attacks that our opponents are throwing at us, McTighe said. Still, he said, There is a lot more research that needs to be done, but we are really starting to figure out how to engage on this issue. youtube.com  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"LGBT young adults are nearly twice as likely to use tobacco as others, in part because the coming-out process can be so stressful. View this image  This Free Life / Via youtube.com View this image  This Free Life / Via youtube.com View this image  This Free Life / Via youtube.com youtube.com View this image  This Free Life / Via Facebook: thisfreelife We know LGBT young adults in this country are nearly twice as likely to use tobacco as other young adults, said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDAs Center for Tobacco Products, in a statement. As a result, tens of thousands of LGBT people die from smoking-related illnesses each year. The federal agency says the higher smoking rates in the LGBT community can be attributed in part to the stresses of coming out. The coming out process is a unique tobacco-use risk factor for LGBT young adults due to the actual and perceived social stigma, discrimination, and anxiety experienced during this process, the FDA said. Tara Goodin, a spokeswoman for the FDA, told BuzzFeed News the campaign targeted 18- to 24-year-olds because these were the most common ages for people to come out and begin exploring their new community. As such, theyre also more exposed to social smoking environments in clubs and bars, she said. youtube.com youtube.com The $35.7 million campaign is seeking to lower those rates through advertising and social media promotion in 12 U.S. markets, including major cities such as San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, and Miami. After three years, survey data in these markets will be compared with 12 control markets to analyze the success of the campaign. Facebook: video.php One Facebook video produced by the campaign is steeped in imagery that will be familiar to many in the YouTube generation, including snippets of coming-out films, video confessions, and proposals.

aS"The position of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Loretta Lynch says, should always be toward inclusion and equality. From Black Lives Matter to transgender protections to efforts at improving the lives of people released from prison, Lynch tells BuzzFeed News how she is working to give effect to that mission. View this image  Attorney General Loretta Lynch, right, talks with her deputy chief of staff Shirlethia Franklin, left, and counselor James Cadogan during a flight to the Talladega Federal Correctional Institution in Talladega, Ala., on Friday, April 29, 2016. Evan Vucci / AP Attorney General Loretta Lynch is already more than halfway through her expected time as the head of the Justice Department. Shes only been there a year. She has a limited period of time to make her mark on the office in a period dominated by crises, from attacks from Charleston to San Bernardino to police protests from Chicago to Baltimore. Quietly, beneath that series of events, she has an overarching mission: When it comes to the Department of Justice, she said in a wide-ranging interview with BuzzFeed News, the position on a whole host of issues should always be toward inclusion and equality. From police accountability to the national re-examination of criminal justice priorities to LGBT anti-discrimination efforts to Black Lives Matter protests, Lynch kept returning to an aim of advancing inclusion and equality in describing her efforts at the helm of the Justice Department. The interview came at the tail end of an unusual trip intended as capstone to Justice Departments National Reentry Week: Lynch, a sitting attorney general, visited a medium-security federal prison in Talladega, Alabama, on Friday. Then she flew to Mobile, Alabama, to meet with the U.S. Attorney, Kenyen Brown, for a few events aimed at promoting reentry programs that Brown has long backed. View this image  Attorney General Loretta Lynch, left, shakes hands with Derrick Cash during a visit to Talladega Federal Correctional Institution on Friday, April 29, 2016, in Talladega, Ala. Evan Vucci / AP One of the benefits of being attorney general is that you get to pick a week and name it something, she joked to a group of inmates at a substance abuse treatment program in Talladega. This was Lynch trying to wrest control of the news cycle and push an affirmative story how the Justice Department is trying to reintegrate people who have served time back into society. Its what we call re-entry, but what is really helping people get back home, Lynch told a group of inmates in a classroom at the start of her tour of the prison. Later, she spent about a half-hour with five inmates in a sit-down roundtable discussion, talking about the programs they participate in, the work-related certifications theyve obtained, and how several of the men maintain connections with their children and grandchildren. We sit in Washington, and we try and figure out what works and what doesnt work, she told the inmates, but in order to do that we have to hear from people who are actually in the programs. Both prison and Justice Department staffers spoke constantly about how unusual it is for men serving sometimes lengthy prison sentences many for violent crimes to be given direct access to the attorney general of the United States. The unusual nature of the visit was clear throughout the morning. When Lynch asked if she could walk out into the rows of inmate workers at a facility where inmates were making Army trousers, she was told that she could not. Almost one in three Americans has had some contact with the criminal justice system, she said on the flight home of what she called a critical juncture for discussion of reentry issues. When you reach that saturation point, people begin to understand, in a very visceral way, the difficulties of reentry. The current moment in which drug sentencing laws are being reexamined, and the federal government is removing initial hiring questions about criminal background for many jobs could be a huge shift in criminal justice policy. But it also can prove to be tricky politics. The relatively nascent coalition between progressives, libertarians or libertarian-minded conservatives, and some corporate interests to transform the criminal justice system is fairly untested on a national political scale. Saying that were reexamining things, Lynch said: I think thats a very, very good thing. I think its something we always have to be committed to doing: Are the choices that we made in the past still the right ones for today? View this image  Attorney General Loretta Lynch tours a factory where inmates work during a visit to the Talladega Federal Correctional Institution in Talladega, Ala., on Friday, April 29, 2016. Evan Vucci / AP While the Justice Department directed attention this past week at the reentry process, much of the public attention over the past year and a half when it comes to criminal justice issues since the police shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri has been on the police side of the process. Does the attorney general think the country is learning from the events including attention paid to other police-involved shootings since then? I do, she said. I actually do. Because of the ever-present video capabilities that many people have on their phones today, Lynch said, [W]e do have viral videos of extremely difficult acts to watch people being shot, people losing their life, being harmed it has caused a lot of turmoil because people are rightfully frustrated. While she called it unfortunate that it took painful moments like Browns death or those of others including Freddie Gray, Tamir Rice, and Sandra Bland to draw attention to different elements of black peoples interactions with police forces across the country, Lynch said that now the issues cannot be ignored. Because now, people who have for whatever reason, this is not part of their experience that have tended to say, No, this isnt a problem, I dont think its as bad as you say, Oh, it cant be that serious. No one can really hide behind that shield anymore, and so we have to face this, Lynch said. I always liken it to the civil rights era, when television showed what was happening to the marchers, particularly the kids actually, in parts of this state drawing national attention to it, and people had to come up with solutions. View this image  Steve Helber / AP Those videos, and the moments of protest created in their wake, Lynch said, have led to a conversation, the likes of which we really havent been able to have, on the issues of community involvement, police accountability, race and the criminal justice system, the economy and the criminal justice system, poverty, joblessness, all these things are being talked about. Lynch sounded an optimistic note, too, saying, [W]e see law enforcement stepping up and being accountable, we see local law enforcement dealing with officers who have crossed the line, we see community members being involved in police training and police discussions. Whether all police efforts at stepping up and being accountable are going well is another question. Last week, after news came out that the City of Cleveland had reach a $6 million settlement with the family of Rice shot by police seconds after they drove up to the 12-year-old, who was carrying a toy gun the Cleveland police union responded that they hoped the family would use some of the money to help educate the youth of Cleveland in the dangers associated with the mishandling of both real and facsimile firearms. The videos have also galvanized a new generation of activists loosely organized under the phrase Black Lives Matter that have dominated the 2016 campaign and thrust forward criminal justice issues into the national discourse. The activists have not always been received with universal warmth. President Obama recently said that, for the Black Lives Matter movement, you cant just keep on yelling after youve gotten the attention of those in leadership positions. Earlier in the month, former President Clinton who last year apologized for some of the tough-on-crime policies he pursued as president had an aggressive, and at points dismissive, response to protesters challenging him on actions taken by his administration and a term, superpredator, once used by his wife in the 1990s. Lynch isnt frustrated with the Black Lives Matter activists. I dont comment on what other people say about the movement or anything like that, because they have their own perspective, she said, but what I would say is that we, in this country, have a strong tradition of a protest movement being often the forefront, raising issues, airing issues, bringing them to the light, bringing them to the forefront, and that its an incredibly important role to play particularly when young people are involved with them, because they will continue that work. That work, she continued, has many dimensions. I think activists are needed in a whole variety of fronts, saying that people are needed to raise those issues, to talk about policy about those issues, and to implement policy that is adopted in response to such discussions. Theres a whole lot of work out there to be done and I think the protest movement is an important part of that. Criminal justice issues, of course, arent the only issues getting the attorney generals attention. Over the weekend, Ted Cruz locked in an uphill battle with Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination attacked Trump on Meet the Press for, in his words, agreeing with Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton that grown men should be allowed to use little girls restrooms. Thats not how Loretta Lynch would put it. Lynchs Justice Department is one of the key agencies advancing that Obama administration position first adopted by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that sex discrimination bans for the workplace and schools should be read to include a ban on anti-transgender discrimination, including allowing people to use restrooms that correspond with their gender identity. The Justice Department decided under Attorney General Eric Holder that Title VIIs ban on sex discrimination covered gender identity, and Lynchs Justice Department filed a brief before a federal appeals court supporting a students claim regarding the education argument. Lynch said the department is very gratified that the court recently affirmed the departments position. To me, this is really an issue of equality and fundamental fairness and what kind of a society do we want to be, she said, unprompted. We decided over 200 years ago that we wanted to be an inclusive society, and we wanted to guarantee equal rights for all. For that to mean something, we have to be careful, we have to be vigilant, so that when people, for whatever reason, are either [made to] feel like theyre on the outside a particular group or are placed on the outside, that that doesnt happen. And transgender issues are no different, to me, in that regard. She said she believes that the among the roles of the Justice Department is to protect the vulnerable: the elderly, children, and human-trafficking victims. Our transgender family members and friends are also incredibly vulnerable to discrimination, in terms of the laws that we see, but also to abuse, she said. Lynch called the Shepard-Byrd Hate Crimes Prevention Act a tool to deal with that when transgender people are being targeted. But then, this to me is all a part of the whole: If were going to have the view that were going to protect everyone in this society equally, we have to mean it. Asked if that would include the Justice Department similarly adopting the view of the EEOC that sexual orientation-based discrimination is a type of sex discrimination barred under existing civil rights laws, Lynch hedged on the issue. Were looking at that issue, also, and well definitely come to a conclusion soon as to what position to take, she said. But I think that overall, the position on a whole host of issues should always be toward inclusion and equality. The issue is that there isnt much time left. Obama will leave office in less than a year. View this image  Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP Lynch made it clear that shes going to keep pressing forward at advancing her mission of increasing inclusivity and equality the next endeavor is a review of women in the criminal justice system. The men in the Talledega prison talked a lot about the effect of the programs that theyre in on their families, Lynch said. We find that, when you incarcerate a woman whos a mother, it really does tear a family apart. So, we want to see: What are we doing to keep them connected? Outside of that new initiative, Lynch said that she aims to carry through initiatives that she and Holder before her have begun over the next nine months. If the tenor of news lately is fairly dark, Loretta Lynch is optimistic about the effect of the things that already have happened and that programs she has put in place will go on beyond her time running the department. We now have discussions on these really hard, very difficult issues that have been difficult to have before and were having more of a conversation than ever, she said. Its not a perfect situation by a long shot. There is still tension, there is still mistrust between law enforcement and community members, but what we see is situations where we come together and build bridges, it can be done. For example, she said efforts like the projects highlighted during National Reentry Week, law enforcement and community empowerment efforts, and other police training efforts will continue over the remaining months and, she hopes, into the next administration. I dont know whats going to happen in the cases that were talking about, for example, in the Title VII field, she said. But I think, for me, when you look at the direction of the law, it always moves toward equality. It is slow and painful. Many times it is difficult. We dont get there overnight. But I think the work that were doing here, and over the next nine months is going to contribute to that.

aS"James Parker describes himself as a happily married heterosexual dad. View this image  Sydney University Catholic Society / Via Facebook: events At an event run by the Catholic Society on Wednesday, students will hear from James Parker, a writer and speaker who has previously been involved in the Journey Into Manhood conversion program run through the UK group, People Can Change. In 2014, Parker wrote a piece for the International Business Times titled Gay Conversion: I Slept With Over 200 Men, Now Im a Happily Married Heterosexual Dad. I dont miss the gay lifestyle I left behind when I visited my ex-boyfriend, five years after therapy, it brought to home to me the drawbacks of that life, Parker wrote. His voice had become camp and weak, and he had even contracted HIV. Gay conversion therapy has been condemned by the Royal Australia and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists and the Australian Psychological Society. In 2015, a report from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called for nations to ban the practice and described it as unethical, unscientific and ineffective and, and may be tantamount to torture. View this image  Georg Tamm I would have been OK with them inviting a priest, discussing why men and women are made for each other according to the Catholic scripture. That would have made sense to me, he said. But I dont see the pertinence of inviting someone who is supposedly a patient of successful ex-gay therapy, when it has no scientific merit and is actually quite dangerous. Quite frankly, the Catholic Society doesnt seem to care about the welfare of those students, he said. Im upset that this is not a message of love and tolerance. I think this is pushing people away from the Catholic Church at a time when we need people to take the religion seriously and do good things with it. View this image  Samuel Kubani / AFP / Getty Images  Jones and his co-officer Marcus Wong sent a letter to the student union president, Alisha Aitken-Radburn, on Sunday night. Tamm wrote to director of student support services Jordi Austin and was contacted by the vice chancellors office, who thanked him for bringing the event to their attention and said they too would contact Aitken-Radburn. Aitken-Radburn told BuzzFeed News she had received one formal letter of complaint and the board of the student union would discuss the matter on Monday afternoon. The Catholic Society does not seek to outcast or preach hate against any students on campus, regardless of their beliefs and identities. However, we are entitled to present the Catholic perspective on complementarity and the assumption it endorses gay conversion therapy is not correct. View this image  Sydney University Catholic Society / Via Facebook: events View this image  Sydney University Catholic Society This talk is about the complementarity of men and women, it is not intended as gay conversion therapy, wrote Tamer. Of course, there are different opinions and schools of thought on the matter of gender identity and compatibility, and thats understandable everyone is entitled to present their view. I am amazed by the biased and close-minded comments made on this event page, another person wrote.

aS"Keith Farnish and his 17-year-old non-binary child Kaelin told BuzzFeed News what its like when you cant open a bank account or apply to university without ticking the male or female box. That isnt equality. View this image  Keith, left, and Kaelin Swns.com / Katielee Arrowsmith The father of a 17-year-old student is campaigning to change Britains banks because he cannot find one that will give his child, who identifies as genderqueer and non-binary, an account because all the online application forms require customers to be either male or female. Keith Farnish, 45, told BuzzFeed News that he and Kaelin, who live in a small village in the Scottish Borders, have gone to bank after bank in a quest to find just one that will allow them to join up without having to tick one of two gender boxes. When youre filling something in and you dont identify as male or female and you only see those two boxes then you dont see yourself there, said Farnish. You are absent. That must hurt, and thats what makes me angry. Theres no reason for it. It doesnt need to be like this. Their attempts to open an account came during a wider mission to reconcile all official documents relating to Kaelin who uses the pronouns they, their, and them that exposed another barrier for anyone who doesnt identify as male or female: You cannot apply to university unless you tick one or the other. But it was their battle with banks that prompted the Farnishes to speak out. Kaelin needed a new account because their existing one used the female name they were given at birth, which has since been changed by deed poll and, said Kaelin, in order that that they could pay the deposit for their university accommodation in September. They first approached the Co-operative Bank widely seen as a progressive alternative and the bank their dad has been with for years. The online form said male or female, said Farnish, and had all the standard titles i.e. Mr, Mrs, Miss etc. Many non-binary and transgender people prefer the title Mx instead, as it doesnt denote a gender, but this was not an option, he said. Initially, Kaelin took action. Swns.com / Katielee Arrowsmith swns.com I phoned them up, Kaelin told BuzzFeed News. And the guy said, Well get back in touch with you within two weeks, because someone else has complained about this as well. But I got nothing back from them. Then Kaelins father intervened. I made a formal complaint, said Farnish. I got a letter back from the Co-op and the essence of it was, Were going to have to spend money [changing this] so were not going to. Disappointed, they abandoned the Co-op, hoping to find success elsewhere. While Kaelin was at school, Farnish looked up First Direct online, found the same problem, and then phoned the bank, asking if it would allow Kaelin to register without registering as male or female. The person I spoke to was like, We could look into it. And I said, Well, whats the position now? [And they replied,] We cant do that at the moment, but if you want you could do something over the phone where you have to put male or female initially and then afterwards we can take it off. But you cant do it online. Farnish said: A lot of people will try to sign up and yes, they too could go into branches and perhaps do some kind of fudge and work it out somehow, but thats not how it should work. That is not equality. And so Farnish set about looking for alternatives, hoping that with so much choice in personal banking there must be one that did not discriminate against non-binary people. He searched through seven more online bank account application forms. Barclays, he said. HSBC. Santander. Halifax. TSB. And Lloyds. Every single one requires gender to be male or female. Why are they collecting this information at all? Why is gender important? There are other ways of identifying people. Only the Royal Bank of Scotland, which was holding Kaelins old account, would allow an application without gender. But, said Farnish, even then the bank does not allow for Mx as a title, and they will still have to go into the branch to change the name. Its another reminder, said Kaelin. A reminder that youre different. But I dont think Im particularly different to other people I just dont fit male or female, I drift somewhere in the middle. So going on to the websites and seeing that, its disheartening. Even people who havent grasped the concept of non-binary or havent met anyone whos non-binary will know that transgender people exist. View this image  Swns.com / Katielee Arrowsmith Not being able to find a bank account might not seem on its own like a crucial issue, said Kaelins father, but is indicative of a world that demands a strict divide down gender lines, making life, in countless everyday ways, difficult for anyone who falls between those lines. Its not life and death, he said. But, actually, embracing your identity and being comfortable in that identity? In many cases it is. The timing was particularly unfortunate. Kaelin came out to their family and friends in March last year and after changing their name wanted to ensure that every official file had their new name and reflected their correct gender identity. It was a new start, said Kaelin. Like, Im going to leave the old me behind and everythings going to be fine. But then it just hit a brick wall at the first hurdle. There have been other walls for Kaelin. In particular, when applying to university through UCAS (the University and Colleges Admissions Service), which runs the application system for higher education. You have to pick male or female, said Kaelin about what happens when you sign up. I complained to my school, who got in touch with them, and Ive emailed a couple of times. But, they said, it didnt work. UCAS Kaelin ended up ticking the male box, because if you want to go to university you have to say youre male or female, said Farnish, who stepped in again, contacting UCAS in a bid to help his child. But this time he came armed with something else. I ripped the code off [the UCAS website], I rewrote it it took me a minute to do another box. I then tweeted it back to them and said, This is what it can look like. No response. Farnish said he also discussed the situation with UCAS, but, They basically said, Were not going to do it, because its too difficult. The UCAS online application does now allow for Mx as a title, but still asks applicants to check the male or female box. For Farnish, attempting to overcome these obstacles for the sake of Kaelin is his duty as a father. Im a parent that cares, he said. As far as Im concerned whatever my child does, I will support them, and something as fundamental as their identity its who they are how can I deny that? How can I not want to defend that to the hilt? I would like Kaelin to be seen as a person and not be judged for who they are. There are wider implications, too, he said. People are people. It shouldnt matter who youre attracted to, it shouldnt matter what the contents of your pants are, none of this should make any difference. Gender is more than just whats between your legs. We have to take the whole person into account. Farnish admitted that for him and Kaelins mother, there was an adjustment process when their child came out last year learning, for example, to use they rather than she. It takes a while to get your head round, but actually none of this is a big deal, or should be a big deal, he said. Its a steep learning curve for parents to see your child, someone youve always known, as a particular identity and to see that as far as youre concerned changed. But as far as the trans person is concerned, theyre simply being who they always were. Kaelin, to whom BuzzFeed News spoke separately, echoed this. View this image  Swns.com / Katielee Arrowsmith It took a couple of months for them to come to terms with everything, said Kaelin. It was like a whole new thing they hadnt experienced before, so it was a bit of a shock but I came out originally as bisexual when I was 12 or 13, so theyve known I was a bit queer for quite a while! And theyve been wonderful. Its a shame some people dont receive the same amount of support. Kaelin remains optimistic, however, as despite their experiences with banks and UCAS, some organisations have responded well to requests to change personal details. Ive managed to change my name at my GP. They still use my biological sex thats understandable from a medical point of view but my title has been changed from Miss to Mx. And Ive talked to my GP about my gender and shes like, Yeah, cool. That was good. Kaelin has also found people at school to be generally supportive, although most people dont use the correct pronouns for me. But hey, were getting there. And as Kaelin grapples with the reactions of other people and the responses of institutions, they are keen to point out the positives elsewhere to being out as non-binary. Ill meet someone and talk to them and notice Ive completely messed with what they thought the whole of society was based on, said Kaelin. I had a 10-year-old come up and say, Are you a boy or a girl? And I said, Im neither. And his jaw dropped to the floor and was like, What? You can be that? Also Ive had people come up and say they dont feel comfortable identifying as something, or theyre wanting to change pronouns, and being able to give that support is cool. Its not all sadness and confusion. Kaelins dad will continue fighting on their behalf until the world accepts his child as he does. Farnish said he wants a complete sea change in the way banks and other organisations operate. I would hate to be in their situation, he said. Maybe in a few years time it will be a lot easier. I would like Kaelin to be just be seen as a person and not be judged for who they are. He stopped for a moment to consider what judging others means, and when it is justified. There is no cause for judgment unless youve committed a crime. A spokesperson for the Co-operative Bank told BuzzFeed News: Regrettably, due to system restrictions we arent yet able use MX titles when opening customer accounts but we can amend their title on debit cards and other correspondence on request once the account is set up. Ben Jordan, senior policy executive at UCAS, said: We already offer the gender neutral Mx as a Title option and this is just the starting point for us. UCAS is currently re-developing its Apply service, and as part of this, we will be adding further options for answering the Gender selection question, beyond male and female. First Direct told BuzzFeed News: We work hard to promote gender diversity right across the bank, and are currently working on plans to include other gender options in our application processes in the near future.

aS"605,234       VIEWS To protest anti-trans bathroom bills, some attractive, cis-passing trans people have taken selfies to show the absurdity of having to use a restroom that doesnt match their gender identity. But do cis allies who share these images express allegiance to established gender roles as a condition of their support? View this image  Sarah McBride, James Sheffield, Brae Carnes, Michael Hughes In the wake of North Carolinas HB2 bill, which bars transgender people from entering government-run restrooms that correspond with our self-determined gender, many trans folks have been fighting back against the policing of our basic bodily functions. One method of protest thats being used to great effect lately: taking selfies. Often posing in public restrooms that correspond with their assigned gender, trans people are attempting to poke holes in the logic that spurred HB2 (and other similar bills across the country). One man, James Sheffield, posted a tweet that became the template for this strategy, though the tactic has been employed before and since. The shock factor of seeing a hyper-masculine man being legally compelled to use the womens restroom has opened many cis peoples eyes to the absurdity of the law. And just last week, a new type of viral image emerged when transgender advocate Sarah McBride posted an Instagram selfie in the womens room of a North Carolina government building, which took off on Facebook. But for all the warranted attention these selfies are bringing to the plight of trans people in North Carolina, is it all the right kind of attention? Many of these posts were met with encouragement and approval from both trans people and cisgender allies, though there were a number of articles that noted how, in particular, images of cis-passing trans men in womens rooms stoke the fears of cis men who dont want men sharing restrooms with their wives and daughters strikingly similar to the paternalistic fear mongering thats perpetuated the bathroom predator myth to begin with. View this image  James Sheffield / Via Twitter: @JayShef Meanwhile, a selfie like McBrides showing a conventionally attractive white woman who is not visually identifiable as trans inspired many people who shared it to express disdain that someone who looked exactly what one would expect a woman to look would be barred from entering a womens room. But the fact that she looks indistinguishable from a cisgender woman renders that image unrepresentative of what many, if not most, trans people go through in public restrooms. Even as her attempt to humanize the struggle of trans people has proven convincing to a broader public, the way her image is being shared advances the idea that trans people are only deserving of bathroom safety if we present as normal, respectable, and indistinguishable from cis people. The reality is that anti-trans bathroom laws cannot be adequately captured by our presence in any bathroom rather, it can be captured most fully by our absence. The biggest impact of the law is not on cis-passing trans men or women, but on non-passing trans people, especially women of color; gender-nonconforming people who feel uncomfortable in either bathroom; and other trans people who avoid using public restrooms entirely. When these selfies showing hyper-feminine or hyper-masculine gender presentations float to the top of social media timelines as they go viral, the images present narratives that have little bearing on the lives of trans people who are most affected. At best, bathroom selfies by cis-passing trans people open up discussion about the pitfalls of anti-trans bathroom legislation. But at worst, they perpetuate the myth that the issue of trans bathroom use can be solved by simply allowing only the people who look like the right gender to safely use the bathroom of their choice. As BuzzFeed News reported, McBride posted a selfie on Instagram Tuesday from the womens bathroom of a North Carolina government building, after spending several days in the state speaking to trans people about how the law has affected their lives. In the caption that accompanies her post, McBride talks about how trans women are portrayed as perverts and men dressed as women by people who support anti-trans bathroom laws. Then she wrote, Im just a person. We are all just people. Trying to pee in peace, and concluded her message with: Stop this. We are good people. The Facebook post that accompanied her Instagram has been shared more than 40,000 times as of this writing. View on Instagram Instagram: @sarahemcbride Given McBrides own desire to tell the stories of a range of trans people in North Carolina, its clear that shes invested in combatting discrimination for all trans people. As she herself wrote in a comment to her post: I also want to be mindful of the privilege that I have of being able to go back to a place where Im not barred from govt restrooms. I want to be mindful of the fact that the impact of these laws disproportionately impacts young trans people, trans people of color, and trans people with disabilities. Yet as McBrides image continues to be shared outside of her immediate control, its clear that a significant segment of the public her message has reached feels more comfortable welcoming trans women who look like her into the womens room than those who do not. Among the hundreds of comments that have flooded McBrides image on social media are dozens that commend her appearance. As a young, cis-passing, and feminine-presenting white trans woman, McBride serves as a non-confrontational model for the segment of trans people who live their lives being perceived as cisgender, able to frequently use public restrooms undisturbed and unnoticed. More than simply commending her beauty, many of the reactions to McBrides image either implicitly or explicitly exclude other trans people. Sarah looks like a woman and should be able to go into the ladies room to pee, wrote one commenter, and another gave this appraisal along with their support: You dont look like a pervert and you dont look like a man either. These cis commenters are implying that they very well might not be as supportive of McBride if she looked less like a woman and clearly they view themselves as the arbiters of this judgment. Transfeminine people who look like men remain unwelcome in the womens room, as they have been even before the spate of anti-LGBT legislation targeting bathroom use. In a study published in 2013 by Jody L. Herman from UCLAs Williams Institute, the most recent and comprehensive to date, the author demonstrates the already significant existing impact of the lack of restroom accessibility on trans peoples lives. Through a survey of 93 transgender people in the Washington D.C. area, Herman found that more than two-thirds of her respondents reported experiencing verbal harassment, 18% had been denied access, and 9% had been physically assaulted in public restrooms. The study also shows that nonbinary or genderqueer-identified people were significantly more likely to experience problems in public restrooms, and that male-to-female trans people were more likely to be physically assaulted, with one reporting that she was sexually assaulted when she tried to use the mens room. According to Herman, these experiences have had far-reaching effects for trans people. Respondents reported having to miss school or quit jobs because they were denied access to restrooms, and more than half reported having avoided going out in public due to concerns about restroom accessibility. These are the actual, day-to-day impact of the lack of safe public restrooms in trans peoples lives which are only amplified by laws that attempt to deny us access to restrooms that correspond with our gender identity. Details about how, exactly, laws like North Carolinas would be enforced are muddled, with police departments across the state unclear about how people who violate the law would be identified, charged, and penalized. But regardless of how the law is enforced, the hostile environment in which it was conceived is enough to negatively impact the trans population in a major way. Selfies of cis-passing trans people in public restrooms simply cannot communicate the fears of the most vulnerable segments of the trans population and the people who post them, often acknowledging their privilege, arent necessarily attempting to speak for everyone. But as these images continue to be shared and commented on outside of the posters control, many of the people who express support for their subjects also articulate allegiance to established gender roles as a condition of their support. Focusing on trans people who are, for the most part, able to use restrooms without much trouble risks sending a message to cis people that trans people who present in socially acceptable ways are the ones most deserving of safety and support. Many of us are unable to present in these ways, whether because of our gender expression, our physical makeup, or our lack of access to gender-affirming medical procedures. Neither stoking cis peoples fears, nor comforting them with palatable images of good trans people, will assure safe restroom use for the entire trans population. It is only by asserting all trans peoples right to have equal and unimpeded access to public life, regardless of our gender identity or presentation, that we can hope to ensure a future where every trans person can use public restrooms in peace.

aS"The Dept. Of Education released thousands of pages of documents on private religious schools that have been granted exemptions from laws banning sex-based discrimination in schools, even though they receive federal money. View this image  Acting Education Secretary John King Jr. and President Barack Obama AP / Andrew Harnik / AP The Department of Education on Friday published thousands of pages of documents on religious schools applying for, and receiving, permission to discriminate against LGBT people and women even though the schools continue to receive federal education funds. Dorie Nolt, a spokesperson for the department, told BuzzFeed News, Due to exceptional public demand for more information on this topic, we are posting documents related to this on our website to provide transparency around this issue. The records are available on a department webpage that includes records from 232 religious schools, including their applications to be exempt from civil rights laws banning sex-based discrimination in school, and letters from federal officials granting those requests. It also includes records from another 31 schools with pending requests. It appears no request has ever been denied. The cache is made public as applications for waivers have spiked in recent years an apparent backlash to the Obama administration interpreting bans on sex discrimination to also include bans on transgender discrimination. Since BuzzFeed News reported on the increasing number of exemptions in mid-December, it appears 16 more religious schools have applied for waivers. Among the applications is a letter from Spring Arbor University President Brent Ellis, who requested in 2014 to allow the University religious freedom to discriminate on the basis of sex, including gender identity, and sexual orientation, in regard to housing, living arrangements, restrooms, locker rooms, and athletics. The request was granted on those terms. Although some of the documents had been disclosed previously through records requests, the mass release of up-to-date documents comes four months after eight U.S. senators, including Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, requested more transparency into the practice of granting waivers from Title IX of the Education Act. The 1972 law prohibits publicly funded schools from engaging in sex-based discrimination. However, it also provides an exemption for religious schools. By obtaining a waiver, the schools can discriminate even while taking in funding though Pell grants, federal student loans, or other federal sources. Sen. Wyden told BuzzFeed News on Friday that by publishing the documents, The Department of Education is helping students and parents get all the facts before they decide where to invest their higher education dollars. Everyone should have the right to get an education at a school that respects and protects their core rights to be who they are and love who they want, he added. Although Title IX waivers were moderately popular in the 1970s and 80s, they were rarely sought in the past two decades. Before the Obama administration, it was generally by schools that wanted to ban women from seminary schools or oppose abortion. Under the Obama administration, however, applicants have overwhelmingly sought to ban or discriminate against LGBT students or faculty. The increase in recent applications, and their shift in focus, is an apparent response to the Obama administrations 2014 interpretation of Title IX, which asserted that transgender discrimination is illegal sex discrimination. Since then, federal officials have walked a fine line between enforcing Title IX and granting exemptions to religious schools, as required by the law. We at the Department of Education vigorously enforce Title IXs prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sex, including gender identity, in every applicable school, said Nolt. We are committed to protecting every student Congress gave us jurisdiction to protect, to the fullest extent of the law. However, Congress did exempt from Title IXs protection institutions that are controlled by religious organizations, to the extent that Title IX conflicts with their religious tenets. The assistant secretary for civil rights at the Education Department, Catherine Lhamon, told senators in January that her office would post the waiver requests and the governments reply letters online.

aS"A letter to the Justice Department and White House said an anti-LGBT law passed in March violates civil rights laws in education. View this image  AP / Pablo Martinez Monsivais The countrys top LGBT legal organizations urged federal officials on Thursday to make it clear that passing anti-LGBT laws like one in North Carolina will jeopardize their federal education funding. In their letter to White House counsel Neil Eggleston and U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, the five groups write, This administration must make definitively clear that wholesale requirements of sex discrimination like [North Carolinas] HB 2 will put federal funding at risk. North Carolina which is slated to receive $4.5 billion in federal education funds next year passed a law in March that, among other measures, bans transgender students from using school facilities that correspond with their gender identity. However, under the Obama administration, federal agencies have asserted that prohibiting a transgender student from restrooms that match their gender violates Title IX of the Education Act of 1972, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex. In the face of such a categorical violation of federal sex discrimination laws, the normal remedial process of filing complaints with federal civil rights agencies is wholly insufficient, said the letter. It was sent by the American Civil Liberties Union, GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, Lambda Legal, National Center for Lesbian Rights, and Transgender Law Center. A Justice Department spokesperson told BuzzFeed News, The department has received and is reviewing the letter. The Department of Education said in an early April statement to BuzzFeed News that it is reviewing North Carolinas new law to determine any potential impact on the states federal education funding. However, a month after the governor signed it into law, administration officials have not announced the results of their review. James Esseks, director of the ACLUs LGBT Project, told BuzzFeed News that if the administration is willing to challenge school districts that discriminate against transgender students, it should also crack down on states that pass discriminatory laws against transgender students. The Department of Education has pressed several school districts into settlements. And in courts, the Department of Justice has supported transgender students lawsuits against school districts. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals recently agreed with the administrations interpretation of Title IX. But the groups noting legislation in Mississippi, South Dakota, and Tennessee argue that officials must also use the power of the purse with states. We are talking about official discrimination required by the state, said Esseks, arguing North Carolina should lose federal education funds. This is something that is egregious and demands a different kind of response. View this embed  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Cities bidding on the leagues events must have laws in place to protect participants from discrimination. View this image  David J. Phillip / AP The NCAA board of governors announced new measures to protect participants from discrimination, including requiring cities bidding to host an event to demonstrate how they will provide a safe environment for everyone involved. At its quarterly meeting in Indianapolis Wednesday, the board decided to adopt the new requirements for sites hosting on NCAA events in all divisions including the Mens and Womens Final Fours and education events such as leadership conferences. The higher education community is a diverse mix of people from different racial, ethnic, religious, and sexual orientation backgrounds, Kirk Shulz, president of Kansas State University and chair of the board of governors said in a statement. So it is important that we assure that the community including student athletes and fans will always enjoy the experience of competing and watching at NCAA championships without concerns of discrimination. The decision comes after laws were passed in several states allowing residents to refuse services to someone based on their gender identity or sexual orientation. We need to make sure our student athletes are competing in venues and competing in states that have an inclusive environment for all of our student athletes, our fans, and our coaches, Shulz said. Wednesdays announcement is another showcase of the associations values, according to the statement, like the 2001 ban on championship events from states where governments display the Confederate flag. Board members feel the measure will provide assurance that anyone associated with an NCAA championship event whether they are working, playing or cheering will be treated with fairness and respect, the statement reads.

aS"The ordinance in Oxford, Alabama, appears to be the first in the country to criminalize transgender people who use restrooms that match their gender identity in places of public accommodation. View this image  Via youtube.com The American Civil Liberties Union is considering a legal challenge to a city ordinance in Oxford, Alabama, that bans transgender people from using public restrooms that match their gender identity including in restaurants, theaters, and other businesses open to the public. Violators face up to up to six months in jail or a $500 fine. Randall Marshal, legal director of the ACLU of Alabama, said the affiliate is looking at the ordinance and is interested in any potential challenge. He added that criminal penalties prescribed by the ordinance passed Tuesday night increase the chances of a constitutional challenge. There is apparently no comparable city or state law in the United States, said Chase Strangio, a staff attorney for the ACLUs national office, who noted that it applies in a wide range of public venues. It seems that this kind of law comes pretty close to just criminalizing the status of being transgender, which simply cannot be squared with Constitution or, I would hope, our basic moral decency as human beings, Strangio told BuzzFeed News on Wednesday. He added that the ordinance raises serious legal questions, saying, It is plainly sex discrimination when the government acts to expel transgender people from engaging in public life solely because trans people by definition dont conform to expectations of gender norms. The Oxford ordinance makes it a crime for a person to utilize a multiple occupancy or changing facility in facilities designated for use by the opposite biological sex. It defines biological sex as the physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a persons birth certificate. Violators could be fined $500 or jailed. It provides exemptions to those accompanying children, providing medical services, or performing custodial duties. The ACLU has repeatedly displayed an appetite for legal battles over transgender restroom access, most recently filing a lawsuit in March that argued a North Carolina law violates the 14th Amendment and civil rights laws that ban sex discrimination. Unlike the Oxford ordinance, however, the North Carolina statute applies only government-run buildings. On Tuesday night, the Oxford City Council unanimously voted to apply the ban to any business or location open for utilization by members of the general public, saying restrooms are places where people risk molestation and assault. The Anniston Star reported the Oxford City Council was reacting to an announcement from the retailer Target, which has a store in the city, to let customers use restrooms corresponding with their gender identity. Council President Steven Waits said he was acting not out of concerns for the 0.3 percent of the population who identify as transgender, but to protect our women and children. Conservatives have amped up a similar message nationwide with efforts to ban men in womens bathrooms, based on a claim that transgender women may actually be male sex predators prowling restrooms. However, in 17 states and more than 200 cities that protect transgender people in public facilities, there are no documented cases of nondiscrimination laws being used to promote or defend predatory behavior in restrooms. Oxford police did not return a call from BuzzFeed News asking how the ordinance could be enforced, nor did Mayor Leon Smith. None of the city council members immediately responded to questions about a legal challenge, enforcement, or examples of public safety problems in restrooms. But the ACLUs Strangio argued there is no way to enforce this type of law without intruding upon peoples private medical information and bodily autonomy. There is also no precedent for such a policy at the state or city level, he said. I am not aware of another law or ordinance that explicitly targets transgender people and attaches a criminal penalty to the act of using a restroom that matches a persons gender identity where that gender identity is not reflected on a persons birth certificate, said Strangio. The Oxford ordinance says that restrooms, showers, and changing rooms are places of increased venerability [sic] and present the potential for crimes against individuals utilizing those facilities which may include, but not limited to, voyeurism, exhibitionism, molestation and assault and battery. The City Council finds that its citizens have a right to quite [sic] solicitude [sic] and to be secure from embarrassment and unwanted intrusion into their privacy, the ordinance says.

aS"The Equality Act hasnt moved since it was introduced in July 2015. View this image  Rep. David Cicilline introducing the Equality Act. AP Images for Human Rights Campaign / Kevin Wolf The Equality Act was introduced with gusto last summer a cabaret of celebrity Democratic Congress members taking turns at a lectern extolling the bill to ban LGBT discrimination federally. But nine months later, the legislation languishes without a hearing. On Thursday morning, several of those same lawmakers will press the Republican majority to finally call a hearing on the Equality Act in the House Judiciary Committee. The committees attention, they will argue, is the sort of process Rep. Paul Ryan promised when he took the role of House Speaker even if actually passing the bill seems far fetched in a chamber gripped by Republicans. People who think it is okay to discriminate based on sexual orientation or gender identity they can vote against the bill and should be held accountable if they do, Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island told BuzzFeed News in a phone call. If they dont think this bill is the right thing, then have the courage to stand up at a hearing and say you think that LGBT people shouldnt receive full equality. Cicilline, the bills House sponsor, said between 15 and 20 fellow members would attend a press conference Thursday, including House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, and House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra. But the decision to hold a hearing belongs to Rep. Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, who chairs the judiciary committee. His office and committee staff did not respond to BuzzFeed News request to comment on why a hearing has not been scheduled, or if he plans to hold one. The Equality Act would ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity by amending a band of existing laws, most notably the Civil Rights Act of 1964. A companion bill is sponsored in by Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon in the Senate, where it has also stagnated. On the House side, Cicilline said he will give Rep. Goodlatte a letter Wednesday formally asking for the hearing. But, he said, It shouldnt require a special request. It was my hope that once the bill was introduced and had a GOP co-sponsor, that would happen. He is especially hopeful the bill could inch forward under Speaker Ryan, who pledged regular order when he assumed his current role, saying major bills should be drafted in committee. But that has not been the practice, Cicilline said. I think regular order would call for a hearing on this bill. I am incredibly frustrated that Republicans have refused to take up a lot of important issues. Naturally, Cicilline acknowledges little action is likely on numerous Democratically backed bills. But if your position is that anything the Republicans dont want to pass shouldnt be pushed, he said, then we would sit around not doing very much. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Queer housing groups are cropping up around Australia. View this image  Joerg Koch / Getty Images In mid-2015, the pair were perusing a Sydney sharehouse group when they saw two rooms going in an amazing Newtown pad. They set up an interview with the housemates two girls, one guy and crossed their fingers that theyd get it. But Jasper, a gay man and professional drag queen, had work right after the interview and so turned up in costume. [Jasper] turned on the charm and the two girls were absolutely enthralled by him. Everyone was chatting and laughing and having a good time, Jeremy, who is bisexual, told BuzzFeed News. Everyone except the guy. He was quiet and stoic the entire time. [He] didnt say much, just kind of stood to the side whilst we did the tour and interview. I just put that down to him being a bit shy. A few days later, one of the women rang Jeremy to let him know they had chosen someone else. She said Jeremy and Jasper were her first choice, but the guy had vetoed them. It kind of dawned on me. I asked Is it the gay thing?, said Jeremy. She paused for a second and told me it was. Hed just flatly stated he didnt want two queer guys in the house and left the two female housemates utterly shocked. View this image  Facebook The groups have cropped up across Australias biggest cities and beyond Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide, Canberra, Albury-Wodonga. Admins say they fill a crucial gap between underfunded emergency service providers and generic house-hunting websites, where LGBT people might end up with people who seem friendly but dont accept their sexuality or gender. After joining the Queer Housing Sydney group, Jeremy and Jasper found a place to live that welcomed both of them within 24 hours. View this image  Facebook: Queer Housing Adelaide Temporarily moving in with my family as a buffer to find a new household has never been an option for me, as they live three hours away in a regional town and we dont get along so well, she told BuzzFeed News. I was sleeping on a bedbug-infested mattress in my friends lounge room feeling embarrassed, grateful, and like a burden. After coming across people who were turned off or confused by terms like LGBT on Gumtree and generic groups, Leach started Queer Housing Adelaide in October 2014. Its since grown to over 1,200 people. View this image  David Silverman / Getty Images We have all these compacting issues without even also looking at the stereotypical but often truthful scenario of the queer kid being kicked out of home. But theres a positive side to the Queer Housing communities, too. I think people want to access a sense of community, and build that into the fibre of their homes, Leach said. They want to build beautiful, glittery safe havens together where they can share midnight snacks and conversations on the kitchen floor. View this image  Peter Parks / AFP / Getty Images Its hard to get an exact number as Australian homelessness data collection does not include questions on sexuality and gender diversity. But anecdotally, said Paradise, LGBT people are at high risk. People are often leaving home early to address their identity, he said, whether its because their family isnt supportive, or because they didnt feel comfortable being able to address their own identity within their home environment. Often school is disrupted early due to bullying. I dont want to paint a picture that just because youre LGBTIQ youre going to be homeless or unemployed. Thats not the case. Its just that theres a much higher proportion of people who didnt have the support when they needed it. Twenty10 has 39 beds for transitional housing, where a young LGBT person pays a small part of their income towards rent while receiving support on issues like education, finances, and mental health to help them live independently. In an average year, Twenty10 helps around 370 young LGBT people much more than it can provide for with the funding it receives, said Paradise. We rely on community support as much as we can, he said. We have had people who live in rural areas, who have broken up with partners after coming out and want to move to the closest city, she said.

aS"Xulhaz Mannan and Tonoy Mahbub were killed in Dhaka. One man has been arrested in connection with their deaths. Bangladeshi LGBT activists Xulhaz Mannan and Tonoy Mahbub were killed on Monday when a group of men wielding machetes barged into Mannans home in Dhaka. A day after the killings, al-Qaedas Bangladeshi branch claimed responsibility for the attack. Mannan, 39, the editor of Roopbaan magazine, the countrys only LGBT publication, also worked for USAID, the U.S government agency responsible for foreign aid. Mahbub, 25, was also involved in the magazine. Their murder was the latest in a series of attacks against secular journalists, bloggers, and academics by Islamist groups that have rocked the country over the past year. ISIS, which has claimed responsibility for the majority of these attacks, has recently identified Bangladesh as a prime target for the groups expansion. While the killing of Mannan and Mahbub has received condemnation from the international community, it has also brought a new level of fear among Bangladeshs LGBT community, who already live under fear of violence and arrests. Mr. Xulhaz Mannan was the most powerful gay man in Bangladesh, so when he can get killed, so we can also be killed [and] nobody will even notice that we are dead, said a 30-year-old queer activist in Bangladesh who asked not to be named out of fear for his safety. He was like Harvey Milk he used to give shelter to LGBTI people in his house, he used to give us hope, give us inspiration, and as a community leader, he used to organize various events which empowered us. Others who appear in these photographs have been obscured or removed for their safety. View this image  View this image  Tonoy loved this photo he had a print of it at home. They called their project Roopbaan because it means Fabulous Boy and is named after a Bengali folk character symbolizing the power of love. The name combined pride and equality. Tonoy was the manager on the executive committee, but all the Roopbaan work was voluntary. Tonoy was also a well-regarded theatre and TV actor, a talented singer and dancer. He even put together Bangladeshs first TV puppet show for children. View this image  His time at the university and during the years that followed was a roller coaster of highs and lows. But it was at a particular low in his late twenties after he broke up with a man he loved dearly that he began to form a community around him. Depressed, he would wander around a park for as long as seven hours a day. Hed not realized it was a well-known spot for gay men. Though he wasnt interested in hooking up, he talked to them and got to know thousands of gay men over the next two years; all of them kept their orientation a secret. In 2007, Xulhaz got a job at the U.S. Embassy, and it was then that he slowly started coming to terms with his emotions and concentrated on making life better for gay people in his country. View this image  View this image  View this image  He was extremely organized and he always made sure groups like the RYLP ran smoothly, getting numerous volunteers to bring their own skills and talents to the table. View this image  Shortly afterwards, his mother received a threat about him while he was away. Be careful with your son, he might be killed, Tonoy said his mother recalled the man telling her. He told Xulhaz about the threat, and though they took it seriously there had already been several bloggers murdered at this point they decided to keep it quiet because they did not want to spread fear. View this image  He worked hard to support himself and his family even though he had recently become a student again. I chose law because now Im working with Roopbaan, and law will be helpful for me in the human rights sector, he told me. He was planning on using his degree to get a job with a decent salary, and fight for LGBT rights. Here he is talking with a colleague at the RYLP, during which volunteers put together a two-day workshop to educate young Bangladeshis about LGBT issues. View this image  He was physiologically male and embraced aspects of masculinity like his mustache, but he would often dress up in a sari. When Im wearing the sari, I dont use very manly gestures I have to wear it softly, he told me with a smile on his face. Maybe [dressing in a sari] is feminine, but Im not thinking its feminine. Im just thinking its a different thing. Or maybe feminine, I dont care. View this image  If the government becomes conscious about these kinds of things now [and makes effort to do something], it will be OK, Tonoy told me. But if [ISIS] or the terrorist groups hold the key to control the people, then I cant say anything. Even when I was not in this community and before I discovered the internet, I always thought that if I had some friends or got to know some more people like me, I will organize a movement for LGBT community in Bangladesh. Because we should have an umbrella. Now Im not afraid but Im conscious about the movement After last years rally, I was threatened. Maybe after this years rally Ill get killed.

aS"Lebanese band Mashrou Leila often sings about topics including political freedom and gay rights. The Beirut-based rock quintet is known for its support of political and religious freedom and endorsement of gender equality and sexual identity. That led them to be dubbed the soundtrack to the Arab Spring, according to Vice. The band said that the official, written justification they were provided as to why the April 29 concert was canceled was because the performance would have gone against what the Ministry of Tourism viewed as the authenticity of the venue. This performance would be the last concert in the Middle East before the band embarks on North America leg of its tour, the bands vocalist Hamed Sinno told BuzzFeed News. Last year's performance at the Roman amphitheater in Amman...  #___ #___ They added that they were unofficially informed verbally and not in writing they will never be allowed to perform anywhere in Jordan due to their advocacy for LGBTQ rights and political freedom. We believe whole-heartedly that we have only ever acted with the intention of making our world a more equal, and just place, even if only through song, the band said in a statement. We pledge to our audience that we will continue to place the integrity of our art as our foremost priority, and to never succumb to the pressure to compromise our message, or to waive our freedom to speak. The Jordanian government, Sinno said, shot itself in the foot because the cancelation has led to an outpouring of support from fans across the Middle East that shows the power of the arts. I think its quite particular that governments across the Middle East will get up and decry the Islamic State when it destroys cultural sites across the region, Sinno said. We understand thats problematic but its also hypocritical when a government does just that within their own community.

aS"Jenner, a registered Republican, still says shes voting for either Ted Cruz or Donald Trump. View this image  Alberto E. Rodriguez / Getty Images Caitlyn Jenner said Tuesday that Republican lawmakers need to be educated on transgender issues, including the right to use the bathroom that corresponds to a persons gender identity and shes still voting for either Ted Cruz or Donald Trump. As far as the GOP and the Republican side of it, they certainly need more education [on trans issues], she told New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof during a Facebook Live interview on Tuesday. The Democrats are certainly better on these issues, but Im not a one-issue voter. Describing herself as a constitutionalist, Jenner, a registered Republican, said she would be voting for either Cruz or Trump in Californias June 7 GOP primary. Facebook: nytimes Jenner added shes been disappointed in Cruz lately, given his recent anti-transgender comments on the campaign trail. In March, she said she wanted to serve as his trans ambassador should he win the 2016 presidential election. In a television interview last week, Trump criticized North Carolina for passing a recent anti-LGBT law that bans transgender people from using certain restrooms. He also said he would be fine with Jenner using the bathroom of her choice were she to visit Trump Tower in New York City. Cruz criticized Trump for the comments during a rally in Indiana on Sunday. Let me make things real simple: Even if Donald Trump dresses up as Hillary Clinton, he shouldnt be using the girls restroom, the Texas senator said. If @Caitlyn_Jenner walked into Trump Tower, what bathroom would @RealDonaldTrump suggest she use? #TrumpTODAY https://t.co/E6jLyif6ls Sundays season finale of her reality show, I Am Cait, saw Jenner and her trans friends travel to Houston, where voters recently repealed a city law protecting the LGBT community from discrimination. Jenner criticized the result of the vote, which came about, in part, after opponents of the law said it would allow men to enter womens restrooms to commit acts of sexual abuse. Speaking to Kristof on Tuesday at a progressive Brooklyn school that has taken measures to support trans students, the countrys most high-profile trans woman said lawmakers in places like Houston, North Carolina, and Mississippi (which has also passed an anti-LGBT law centered around bathrooms) need to be better educated. As far as politicians saying, Its not safe to let the guy into the restroom, there are no cases of trans people in restrooms ever being arrested, ever having any problem. They just want to take a pee and get out of there, she said. View this image  Adrian Sanchez-gonzalez / AFP / Getty Images Jenner said such laws contribute to high rates of suicide and bullying among trans youth. They think theyre saving people, but to be honest with you, theres already laws on the books for guys going in the restroom [to molest someone] whether theyre in a Laker uniform or wearing a dress. Its against the law, she said. Jenner praised businesses for boycotting North Carolina in response to its law, describing it as the right thing to do, but said she would not hesitate to use a female restroom in the state. If I was in North Carolina right now Id go right into the ladies room. Id have no problem, she said. I havent been in a mens room in over a year. 9.

aS'A new anti-LGBT law in North Carolina bans transgender people from using restrooms in government buildings that match their gender identity. View this image  National Center for Transgender Equality This week, Keisling is in Raleigh, North Carolina, protesting a recently passed state law that, among other things, bans transgender people from using restrooms in government buildings that match their gender identity. View this image  AP / Gerry Broome McCrory has repeatedly said that banning transgender women whom he calls men from womens bathrooms protects women and girls from predators. During Keislings visit to the state capitol on Monday, she joined several other activists who stopped at the governors office advocating for the laws repeal. And like others in the capitol, she had to make another stop. View this image  Mara Keisling Reached by phone, Keisling told BuzzFeed News, I was a guest of the state of North Carolina, so guests get to use the bathrooms. It was uneventful, she explained. No one was bothered, because when I go to the bathroom, I do my business, I mind my own business, and then I go about my business. Women saw her enter the restroom without showing any concern, Keisling said, and a state police officer nearby also didnt speak up. Keisling said she told a group of about 20 people in the capitol rotunda what she had done while the officer stood in immediate earshot but the cop did nothing. They are not even enforcing this stupid law in state office buildings, which is where it applies, she said, adding that they cant enforce this. According to the law, restrooms in government-run buildings may only be used by those with a corresponding sex on their birth certificate at the time of birth. How many tourists and lobbyists carry their birth certificate when they go to capitol? Keisling asked. If they are going to check my birth certificate, they damn well check everybodys birth certificate. And if they check my anatomy, they have to check everybody elses. That is how this country works laws have to be enforced equally. Keisling was with a group from the NAACP delivering proposed legislation that would repeal the states anti-LGBT law, which also prevents cities from raising the minimum wage or from passing new nondiscrimination ordinances. The state has been sued in federal court over the law, dozens of businesses have asked state officials to repeal it, and numerous businesses have canceled ventures in the state. Keisling said that protests, attended by thousands, were held on Monday to urge lawmakers to repeal the law the first day the legislature convenes for its spring session. LGBT groups said they delivered petitions signed by more than 150,000 people asking for the law to be reversed. View this image  AP Images for Human Rights Campaign / Jason E. Miczek In a press release, McCrorys office has said LGBT groups misrepresented the number of petitions delivered to his office on Monday. But McCrorys office did not respond to BuzzFeed News request to comment on how it would respond to Keisling using the womens restroom and if they would pursue enforcement action. Right now it is apparent that the governor doesnt have any political power, Keisling said. He doesnt know how to lead his way out of this mess he created. UPDATE: Keisling was arrested with other protesters holding sit ins at the state capitol on Monday evening, a spokesperson for the National Center for Transgender Equality told BuzzFeed News. There was no indication her arrest was linked to using the restroom. A reporter for the Charlotte Observer said on Twitter that 54 people were arrested.

aS'Xulhaz Mannan and Tonoy Mahbub were killed in April. The Bangladeshi branch of al-Qaeda has claimed responsibility for the killings. UPDATE A suspected Islamic militant has been arrested for his alleged involvement in the killing LGBT activists Xulhaz Mannan and Tonoy Mahbub, Bangladesh police said. Police named the man as Shariful Islam Shibab, a former member of a banned Islamic group Harkatul Jihad who joined another militant group, Ansarullah Bangla Team, in mid-2015, the Associated Press reported. Munirul Islam, head Bangladesh polices counterterrorism unit, told a news conference on Sunday that Shibab was arrested in the southwestern district of Kushtia.             BF_STATIC.timequeue.push(function () { document.getElementById("update_article_update_time_8658726").innerHTML = UI.dateFormat.get_formatted_date(\'1463320204\', \'update\'); });  Xulhaz Mannan, editor of Bangladeshs only queer publication, Roopbaan, who also worked for the U.S. Agency for International Development, was hacked to death by a group that entered his house in the capital, Dhaka, The Guardian has reported based on police sources. facebook.com Mannan, who was killed along with his friend and fellow activist Tonoy Mahbub, was the latest in a string of murders of secular bloggers, journalists, and academics that began last year, several of which ISIS has claimed responsibility for. On Tuesday, the Bangladeshi branch of al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for the killings, the Associated Press reported. I am devastated by the brutal murder of Xulhaz Mannan and another young Bangladeshi this evening in Dhaka, said U.S. Ambassador Marcia Stephens Bloom Bernicat in a statement on the embassys Facebook page. Xulhaz was more than a colleague to those of us fortunate to work with him at the U.S. Embassy. He was a dear friend. Our prayers are with Xulhaz, the other victim, and those injured in the attack. We abhor this senseless act of violence and urge the Government of Bangladesh in the strongest terms to apprehend the criminals behind these murders. At least four were assassinated in 2015, including Avijit Roy, author of a landmark book on homosexuality published in Bangladesh in 2010. Just two days before Mannan was attacked, Rezaul Karim Siddique, an English professor and editor of a literary magazine, was killed by a group of men wielding machetes in the northwestern part of the country. ISIS claimed responsibility for the killing, accusing him of calling to atheism. Twenty-six-year-old Nazimuddin Samad, a well-known blogger who spoke out against religious extremism, was killed in a similar assault earlier this month after being named along with 83 others on a list that Islamist militants sent to the countrys Interior Ministry of writers they intended to target. A group of activists founded Roopbaan as a quarterly magazine in 2014, but it was available only through phone orders out of fear of sparking a backlash. When it was launched, those involved in the publication stayed anonymous out of safety concerns. Bangladesh is a growing target for ISIS. Two weeks ago, the group devoted a significant section in its recent issue of its propaganda magazine, Dabiq, to promote turning Bangladesh into a strong jihad base before moving into neighboring India and Burma, where the group says Muslims are oppressed by Hindus and Buddhists. 5.

It all came to a head during a business trip to Vancouver where he had a romance with a man who wrote Agarwal a heartfelt letter as he left.

aS"I had to try out the Hardcore Homo strength class for myself. View this image  The Oakland gym boasts being the first LGBT gym in the country. And, at least for now, they seem to be the only one. Sarah karlan for BuzzFeed Sarah karlan for BuzzFeed That afternoon I sent a selfie to my girlfriend to prove I was actually working out (a rarity) and strolled up to the entrance flanked by rainbow bike racks. It also happened to be 4/20 so there was a ~ special deal ~ going on. View this image  Sadly, I wasnt getting a special greeting each and every new client gets a tour from Huerta on their first day. The queer Latina mother of two walked me around the space she opened nearly six years ago and admitted that its existence is actually a bit of an accident. There was never an actual plan for it, Huerta, who worked as a personal trainer before heading to business school, told me. It was only when she moved her personal training ad on Craiglist to the women seeking women section (for less competition with other trainers) that the clients started rolling in. That first week I got five clients and from there it just kept on coming, she said. By the time winter rolled around, Huerta had enough of a client base to rent out a small space and move the workouts indoors. Within a year she had outgrown the space and it would take two more moves to land where they are now on Park Boulevard. View this image  One gender-neutral bathroom is all you need, really. View this image  Its not just about putting the T up there, its about understanding what that means and how you can truly be inclusive, Huerta explained. After reaching out to local members of the trans community and health professionals, the gym put new standards in place. Trainers say chest instead of breasts during workouts, each class starts with individuals sharing their preferred pronouns, and trainers tailor special workouts for clients undergoing gender transitions. I wanted to be legit in terms of the LGBT title. It was about being authentic. To ensure the utmost inclusivity, classes are never broken down or targeted towards one section of the community. Everyone is welcome to join including straight allies. One thing I love seeing is people go grab coffee after class, people who would probably never have met each other at a bar or any other place, she added. View this image  View this image  View this image  I was in a body building gym, she said of her last job. There were a lot of stares on the floor. At TPS, she no longer has to worry about those types of incidents. As a trainer, Nicole can connect with any trans clients currently going through transitions on a very personal level. When I started my transition, anytime I would get off on my estrogen if my levels were off I would go to the rack and I would lift and lift. View on Instagram View this image  The small class was a mix of jogging around the block, burpees, crunches, and plenty of soul-crushing reps with weights. Many high-fives from Nicole kept me from wanting to melt into my mat. View this image  Once I regained consciousness, I chatted with some of my classmates about how they found TPS. I didnt want just a trainer, I wanted a workout family, one woman told me, adding that her classmates often text her if she hasnt been to class in a while as a friendly and supportive nudge. Someone else mentioned that this was the very first gym they had ever felt comfortable walking into. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .   Hey!

aS"The pastor and bishop performing the ceremony risk being defrocked. The wedding comes weeks before church officials decide whether to repeal a ban on same-sex weddings. View this image  George Lainis/ Courtesy Reconciling Ministries Network Risking their careers, a pastor and bishop of the United Methodist Church told BuzzFeed News they will marry two gay men in North Carolina on Saturday. The ceremony is precisely timed to influence the churchs international voting body, which will consider proposals to repeal a ban on clergy marrying same-sex couples when it convenes next month. The stakes are high for both the pastor and bishop, who could be reprimanded or even defrocked for officiating the ceremony, as has happened to other Methodist clergy who officiated marriages of gay couples in recent years. The ultimate action would be removal of my order, Bishop Melvin Talbert told BuzzFeed News, acknowledging the risks for himself and Pastor Val Rosenquist. I would no longer be a bishop. Delegates at the international churchs General Conference shot down petitions to change church policy in 2008 and in 2012. But now, with the U.S. Supreme Court having ruled in favor of same-sex marriage rights, Talbert, Rosenquist, and the couple getting married Jim Wilborne and John Romano all told BuzzFeed News that this wedding could help persuade delegates at a critical moment for the church. Doing it now will lay this issue squarely before them in a way that hasnt happened before, Talbert said. If the delegates are open-minded, this could have a positive impact. Talbert who was arrested with Martin Luther King Jr. in the Atlanta sit-ins in 1960 linked the wedding to civil rights protests, saying the service is an act of civil disobedience. The only difference is we are giving it another name in calling it biblical obedience. I have to make a choice between my church and God, and I am choosing God, he explained, saying the churchs anti-gay policies are immoral, unjust, and oppressive, and they should no longer deserve our loyalty and support. Discrimination is discrimination no matter where it is, he added. It was race discrimination then, and it is discrimination based on sexual orientation now. View this image  Bishop Melvin Talbert Reconciling Ministries Network With about 7 million members in the United States, the United Methodist Church (UMC) is the largest mainline Protestant Christian denomination. But unlike several other leading denominations, such as the Episcopal Church and Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the UMC has not repealed its ban on same-sex weddings. That is due, in part, to its makeup. The voting bodies of other mainline denominations that have repealed anti-LGBT policies represent just U.S. churches. But the United Methodist Church is governed internationally. That includes African delegations that have joined with conservative American delegates to oppose same-sex marriage in the past. In 2008, delegates came close to passing resolutions to rescind those rules. Four years later, in 2012, similar proposals actually lost by a wider margin. Many believe that was because conservative church delegations from African nations have grown, along with opposition to LGBT inclusion. At the General Conference starting May 10 in Portland, Oregon, 864 delegates will consider a raft of petitions. Several would repeal portions of the Book of Discipline the churchs core doctrine that ban clergy from marrying same-sex couples, state that homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching, and bar funding LGBT-positive organizations. Matt Berryman, the executive director of Reconciling Ministries Network, an LGBT advocacy coalition leading the charge for reforming Methodist policy on sexual orientation, said passing the proposals this year is not a slam dunk. Still, he believes there there is renewed opportunity. In recent years, the churchs Southern United States delegations have come around on marriage equality. Further, the Supreme Courts marriage ruling last year has given the issue immediacy inside church walls. Clergy are being asked by members of their congregations to bless their love, and they are having to say no. Its not just civil equality its also spiritual equality, he told BuzzFeed News. Hundreds of Methodist congregations have joined the Reconciling Ministries Network, Berryman said, including the First United Methodist Church in Charlotte. Marrying this couple before the general conference, he said, It changes hearts and minds of delegates, because their story is a beautiful one. Wilborne and Romano, both 52, kept their wedding plans mostly under wraps until they sent out invitations last month. We didnt want people to have time to organize a protest, Wilborne said. Still, they have hired a security guard to keep potential protesters off the steps. It was important to have their service at the First United Methodist Church on Tryon Street, in downtown Charlotte, where Wilborne has attended services ever since he went there for a funeral for a man who died of AIDS in 1996. I knew we could get married somewhere else, Wilborne told BuzzFeed News. But we wanted to get married where Ive been going to church for 20 years. View this image  Nathan Abplanalp / Courtesy First United Methodist Church The wedding in the towering Gothic church will be mostly traditional: a handbell choir, a chorus, a string trio, an organ. The grooms will wear bow ties. But due to its significance for the church, more than 300 people were invited, including Charlottes mayor, Jennifer Roberts. Its a lot bigger wedding than we would have wanted to have originally, he said. Among those present will be roughly 20 members of United Methodist Church clergy who are invited to bless the couples marriage. The ceremony will by no means be the first same-sex wedding in a United Methodist Church. But, by and large, those weddings in Methodist churches have been kept under wraps. In rare cases, they become known. Bishop Talbert, who served in the Western Jurisdiction before his retirement, performed one in 2013 in Alabama which triggered a complaint against him and ended in a settlement between him and church officials. As part of that settlement last year, the parties agreed to live by the churchs canon law. In 2007, Rev. Frank Schaefer was defrocked for officiating his gay sons wedding, but was later reinstated as a minister on appeal. Only those that get publicity, like mine in Alabama, get the book thrown at them, he said, acknowledging that the service in Charlotte may trigger a particularly potent outcry among conservatives in the church. Its the first time for a big Methodist church in a very major city in the South, Wilborne added. By doing this, we are making a statement that, yes, the South is ready to move this way as well. Pastor Rosenquist also pointed out that out that a Methodist church has never publicly held a same-sex wedding in North Carolina, where lawmakers recently passed a law that allows LGBT discrimination. Its time to make a stand, she said. I am willing to face whatever consequences I encounter. I am totally at peace with this decision. What I would hope for the General Conference is that this wedding is just more evidence of the widespread opposition to the unholy nature of the Book of Discipline the prejudice and bigotry thats in there. Rev. Susan Brooks Thistlethwaite, a professor of theology at the Chicago Theological Seminary, told BuzzFeed News that having such a large denomination approve these rules next month could serve as a counterpoint to those who advocate for religious freedom to undermine the recent gains in equality for LGBTQ people in the U.S. This year, more than 100 bills were filed in state legislatures an unprecedented number to protect religious freedom, widely seen as a backlash to the Supreme Courts same-sex marriage ruling. Some of the legislation, including a law approved in Mississippi, specifically protects those who deny services based on their religious opposition to same sex marriage. The United Methodist Church can have a significant impact on challenging the spurious grounds for opposing LGBTQ rights by standing squarely with the Gospel of Jesus Christ in affirming the full realization of equal human dignity and worth in church and society, she said. Likewise, Bishop Talbert argued progressives should claim the Bible to defend the rights of LGBT people. People on the right consistently hold a Bible up and say all this stuff about gays and lesbians. But that is our book, too, he said. We feel what they are doing is wrong, and they need to change their hearts and mind to see these are people created in the vision of God, and they should not be marginalized or discriminated against.

aS'I just thought if anyone in the world is going to accept me for who I am then its the president of the United States. View this image  Sky News A student came out as nonbinary to Barack Obama in central London on Saturday morning and urged the US president to do more to help transgender people around the world. Maria Munir, whose parents did not know about the 20-year-olds gender identity, stood up at a town hall Q&A hosted by Obama for young people and publicly declared for the first time they identified as nonbinary. Nonbinary identities are those that do not fit within the binary of male or female. Im about to do something terrifying, which is Im coming out to you as a nonbinary person, which means that I dont fit because Im from a Pakistani-Muslim background, which inevitably has complications, the student said, fighting back tears. Justin Tallis / AFP / Getty Images Sky News I know that in North Carolina with the bathroom bill people are being forced to produce birth certificates in order to go the toilet. In the UK we dont recognise nonbinary people under the Equality Act, so we literally have no rights, the activist said as the crowd which included actor Benedict Cumberbatch applauded. What could you do to go beyond what is accepted as the LBGTQ rights movement including people who are outside the social norms? In response, Obama called Munir brave and urged the University of York student to keep pushing for transgender rights in the UK. Obama, who is on his final visit to the UK as president, insisted David Cameron has been ahead of the curve in responding to LGBT issues but admitted change would never come fast enough for campaigners. Despite that he was optimistic as social attitudes have changed on this issue quicker than I have seen on any other. President Obama: "On LGBT issues, I think David [Cameron]\'s been ahead of the curve" #ObamaInUK https://t.co/r69PFakPwn Afterwards Munir explained the decision to come out to the leader of the US on live television: It was something the president said about acting crazy, about how if you need to get a social issue across sometimes you just need to act a little crazy. At that moment I literally felt my pulse intensify and I thought, Ive been sitting on this issue for such a long time. I havent come out to my parents sorry, Mum and Dad and I just thought if anyone in the world is going to accept me for who I am then its the president of the United States. If anyone in the world has the power to change the situation for people like myself it is Barack Obama. The student told BuzzFeed News they expected their parents would be surprised by the news but they didnt want to put a burden on them: I feel bad because Im so close to them but unfortunately we live in a society where people who want to make the worst out of you always will, and unfortunately people in my community would never have responded well to this news. I felt that if I told my parents it would almost be a burden on them because they would feel as thought they would have to keep me a secret. I think theyll be upset in the sense that I didnt tell them. The emotions that go through your entire mind when you know your existence isnt even recognised by the UK government under the Equality Act is a turmoil that I wouldnt wish on anyone. View this image  Christopher Furlong / Getty Images  Munir, whose family are originally from Pakistan, said the UK was lagging behind other countries in recognising nonbinary individuals on official documents. The campaigner, who is standing for election to Watford council as a Liberal Democrat, remained worried about how friends back home would react to the announcement. Munir is involved in a Muslim faith group in Watford and is concerned people back home will now believe they are not a good enough Muslim. However, for Munir this was a risk worth taking. I thought its now or never. Either I was going to come out now to the president of the United States or I was going to have to stay silent forever. If I can use this one little sacrifice and maybe being ostracised by my community then maybe Ill be able to prevent other young people from being ostracised by their community. 6.

aS"Trump came out strongly against the North Carolina law that bans transgender people from certain restrooms. At a town hall meeting in New York, Trump responded to a Twitter user who asked him his views on the law, which overrides local LGBT nondiscrimination ordinances in the state and bans transgender people from using certain restrooms. North Carolina did something that was very strong, and theyre paying a big price and theres a lot of problems, Trump said, reiterating that he would have left things the way they were before the legislation was passed. He said the state was going through strife with all of the businesses leaving. You leave it the way it is. There have been very few complaints the way it is, he said. The law has sparked protests and corporate backlash against the state with several businesses, as well as high-profile performers such as Bruce Springsteen, refusing to work in North Carolina. People go, they use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate, Trump said. There has been so little trouble, and the problem with what happened in North Carolina is the strife and the economic punishment theyre taking. When Today host Matt Lauer asked Trump if he had any transgender employees, Trump responded, I dont know. I really dont know. I probably do. If @Caitlyn_Jenner walked into Trump Tower, what bathroom would @RealDonaldTrump suggest she use? #TrumpTODAY https://t.co/E6jLyif6ls Trump added, You know, theres a big move to create new bathrooms. Problem with that for transgender first of all I think that would be discriminatory in a certain way; it would be unbelievably expensive for businesses and for the country. Leave it the way it is. Last week, Ted Cruz supported North Carolinas anti-LGBT legislation, calling it perfectly reasonable. As the father of daughters, Im not terribly excited about men being able to go alone into a bathroom with my daughters, Cruz told Meet the Press host Chuck Todd at a town hall meeting in New York. And I think thats a perfectly reasonable determination for the people to make. Earlier this month, John Kasich said he would have probably not signed the anti-LGBT law.

aS"CJ Palmer has been denied bail a second time. View this image  Ian Waldie / Getty Images CJ Palmer, 38, is facing a charge of causing grievous bodily harm. It is alleged she infected a client with HIV in the course of her job as a sex worker in 2015. Palmer is currently being held in the maximum-security Casuarina mens prison. View this image  Samuel Kubani / AFP / Getty Images Shes struggling. Shes very stressed out, under a lot of pressure. Its a really difficult situation, Davies told BuzzFeed News. As a woman being held in a males facility, shes had her gender identity taken, basically. Thats a very traumatising thing. Palmer is being held in a crisis care unit for her own safety, where her interactions with other prisoners are limited. Shes definitely frightened. Shes never been in trouble before. This is all completely alien for her. The risk that she poses of endangering the safety of other people is not a matter that can be overcome by any bail conditions, the ABC reported. Palmers lawyer Simon Freitag provided the court with a report from an expert on transgender issues, which stated the male prison was a harmful place for Palmer. Maughan agreed that the situation was unfortunate and asked that a copy of the report be given to the WA prison authorities. The WA Department of Corrective Services has previously said it is bound by the WA Gender Reassignment Act, which allows people to legally change their gender if they submit an application and fulfill certain criteria. Palmer has not legally changed her gender identity under WA law. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"I think [film studios] still see women as a risk, and Im not really sure why, she said at the Tribeca Film Festival. View this image  Directors Julie Taymor and Jodie Foster talk during the 2016 Tribeca Film Festival at Spring Studios on April 19 in New York City. Astrid Stawiarz / Getty Images for Tribeca Film Festival) Gender inequality in Hollywood along with racial discrimination has become one of the most stirring issues in the entertainment industry over the last few months. However, at a Tribeca Film Festival event in which film and theater director Julie Taymor interviewed Jodie Foster on Wednesday evening, Foster said shes sick of the women thing when it comes to conversations about directing. Though Taymor seemed to agree with Fosters sentiment, she added, We dont want to ignore it either. Its real, Foster assented. Its been a very long time that there are very few female filmmakers. Its not just today, its not just this week. I mean, thats always been true. Things changed a lot in Europe, for example lots of female directors; in television, quite a few female directors. View this image  Foster during the 2016 Tribeca Film Festival. Astrid Stawiarz / Getty Images for Tribeca Film Festival When asked why she thinks thats been the case, Foster continued: I think the more financial risk the less risky studios can be. I think they still see women as a risk, and Im not really sure why. Foster, who began her acting career in the 60s and made her feature directorial debut in the early 90s, said shes noticed differences between men and women directors. Sometimes its hard for people to understand how to treat me as a leader, Foster said of her time in the directors chair. They are sometimes waiting for me to punch them in the face, which Im not going to do. Or sometimes they are waiting for me to say, Oh, your ideas so smart. Lets just do it your way. Sometimes its confusing for people. Do they treat [women] the way they treat men? And maybe you dont because women have different leadership styles. I wasnt sure about that, but I see that its true now, she added. Foster noted shes worked with a lot of men directors, but only one fellow female director in her acting career: Mary Lambert, who directed her in the 1987 film Siesta. But Foster did say she has a favorite female director: The Silence of the Lambs Jonathan Demme. He was the one guy who really understood, she explained. He was able to say, OK, this is about a woman who is our hero. The film was informed by that. Its why the film is not filled with gratuitous violence. Its why, yes, it was horrifying and difficult to watch in some ways, but hes the brave heart of that womans voice.

Rodriguez / Getty Images for DGA During an audience question-and-answer segment later during the Tribeca event, one woman asked Foster, who was promoting the forthcoming George Clooney and Julia Roberts film Money Monster that she directed, why shes sick of the discussion surrounding women in film. I feel like the issues are way more complicated than the dialogue. Saying, Well, why arent there any women directors in the big mainstream franchises? is just an incredibly simple question, Foster explained. There are so many reasons and some of them are about psychology, some of them are about the financial worlds and are about the global economy, and some of them are about any number of things. But there are so many answers to that question that go back hundreds of years. And it would be nice to have a more complex conversation and to be able to look at it as more than just a quota or numbers. I just dont think its as cut-and-dry as everybody thinks it is, she continued. And I dont think its a plot, I dont think that theres anyone making plots to keep women down somehow. Its a bunch of people who arent thinking about it, including a lot of female executives that have risen to the top and have not really made a dent in bringing more women into the mix.

aS"Nearing the end of her life, my fiancs mom couldnt make it to our wedding. So we brought the wedding to her. View this image  Charlotte Gomez / BuzzFeed You are formally invited to a formal pajama wedding. The groom will wear bedtime black tie: a tuxedo shirt and black satin bow tie under blue polka dot pajamas. The bride will wear a blush bedcoat and a simple birdcage veil. I hadnt anticipated ever getting married, let alone in the white-paneled living room of my in-laws house in Maryland, surrounded by illustrations of submarines and a whale-like gray sectional from Bobs Discount Furniture. We werent racing to the altar. The blue sapphire engagement ring felt more like a status update than a calendar invite. Liam first asked me to marry him years earlier, a few weeks into dating, buzzed on post-sex Mexican food and an episode of Say Yes to the Dress. It was a question Id been brushing off ever since, despite the nagging realization that I wanted to be with him for the rest of my life. Eventually and gladly, I gave in, and over the following year we began planning a wedding that would take place in the distant future (next, next June). I put down a deposit at a landmark building on Chicagos South Side, near where I grew up and where the Obamas had their reception (a factoid Id share half-embarrassed, as if I shouldnt expect anything so grand). We were overcome with the spirit of a thousand Bachelor contestants, ranking photographers and sifting through catering reviews and crafting a somehow small-seeming list of 150 guests, who would watch us wed in a soft-pink solarium facing Lake Michigan. I dragged photos of the architecturally significant ballroom and eucalyptus bouquets and Reem Acra dresses onto my desktop. Then in August, Liams mom, Michele, got sick. Or, as far as we could discern via imprecise text messages, sicker. She was first diagnosed with breast cancer when Liam was a baby. As he grew up, he was the classic youngest-kid sidekick, tagging along with his mom to the stands of his brothers baseball games and grocery runs and oncology appointments, reading to her from gossip mags during sessions of chemo. In return, when he came out as trans as a teenager, his mom was the first family member to support him. They spoke every day on the phone, but when it came to the specifics of her latest prognosis, she was reticent. I assured him his mom would be fine. Shed gotten worse news before and had always bounced back. Liam adored his mom, who was nothing like my own: his, a stay-at-home Navy wife; mine, a South Side Murphy Brown. The first time I met Michele, she leapt out of her minivan no easy feat for a woman over 6 feet tall snapped a photo of me and Liam, and asked me to call her Ma. I, meanwhile, hadnt yet told my family I was dating anyone. Michele loved all things femme, often reminiscing about an early job at the Clinique counter of Woodys, a now-defunct department store. She loved red carpets, old movies, and Paris (though shed never been), instructing our puppy to call her Mm. In the four years Id known her, shed started using an oxygen tank and progressed from a cane to a walker to a wheelchair. She liked clothes, but was hyperconscious of how they hung on her concave chest after her double mastectomy. Shed dye her short hair a cheery blonde, only to be thwarted when a new round of treatment would leave her turning to wigs that were always too hot. Makeup, however, never failed her. Her own kids didnt care for it; she had two sports-obsessed boys and a daughter who, after years as a no-frills butch, became her son. But I did. Wed chitchat about advances in gel nail polish, and Id send her free products from the womens magazine where I worked. Shed return the favor with a care package, and she would be waiting with a review the next time I visited. Makeup was a cheat code for us, a safe way for me to get to know this chipper woman I appeared to have nothing in common with. I found her persona foreign, then less so, until one day she was Ma. Michele had been desperate to plan another wedding ever since her own, and I was glad to share the experience with her. She would mail me dog-eared issues of Brides and wedding-appropriate Essie nail polishes, along with notes poking fun at the silly names. As her mobility decreased, the idea that she would jet to Chicago in June became less realistic. Liam and I started driving from New York to Maryland to visit almost every weekend. After I got off work on Friday evenings, wed hit the road, where Top 40 sing-alongs and heckling Dave Ramsey callers and enthusiastic Wawa trips drowned out the unspoken realization that Michele didnt have much time left. Liam never mentioned the inevitable, even after doctors said his mom couldnt fly. That could change, I guess, he said, trailing off, the heir apparent to his parents stoic optimism. When I floated the idea of moving the ceremony (much sooner, and to Maryland), Michele was against it, and she let me know in the most diplomatic way possible. Thats very sweet, she said. But its your day. Youre only going to be a bride once. Liam rolled his eyes and laughed. His mom was as stubborn as she was sweet. Shed still go to church every Sunday, even if it took her five minutes to get to the pew; schedule a family dinner and push through until her oxygen tank failed her; get her nails done, if only to check in with her friends who worked at the salon. Privately, Liam talked to her about moving up the wedding, but she said that I deserved better, that shed never ask me to sacrifice on her behalf. This is a big day. Neither Liam nor his mom wanted to be the one who made the choice. They said it was for my sake, but I suspected something else: For either of them to make the call meant admitting defeat. Still, to imagine Liam in some vision-boarded venue without his mom was heartbreaking. So, in October, I decided. I told Michele that having her there was non-negotiable, that she and Liam would do the same thing for me and my mom and that most of all, having a wedding like this exemplified the way I wanted our marriage to be. Were doing it on Thanksgiving, I told her, taking her hand as we sat in her bed, the television humming in the background and a pile of People magazines by our feet (shed always have back issues on hand, to reread with me when we visited). And we want to do it at your house. She didnt dare fight me on it after that after all, I was the bride. She graciously agreed to host and began thinking about the menu. I told my parents and sister to book their tickets that same day.  View this image   This wasnt going to be a Pinterest backyard wedding, where sun-streaked photos of Ball jar centerpieces disguise $10,000 worth of tent and lighting rentals. It would happen in the living room, where Michele could easily move around and take breaks, but we also wanted it to be formal, put together. No one would feel like they were compromising. So we went about creating a real wedding, but scaled down like dollhouse furniture. During the work day, Liam and I fired off link-filled emails with subject lines like Unity candle? We selected readings (Corinthians for the Catholic crowd; Jack Gilberts poem The Forgotten Dialect of the Heart for us), which we compiled into a note on my iPad. We ordered a cake from the gay-owned bakery down the street, found flowers from the only florist on Rockville Pike that would be open on Thanksgiving morning, and got a new SD card for our DSLR camera so our siblings could document the day. We felt like contestants on Double Dare, giddy and in love, scrambling to complete the physical challenge before the clock ticked out. We are all so excited to meet you and to have our families officially joined with the kids, Michele emailed my family, whod be flying into Maryland from Chicago. We are extra super proud of Liam as he sure knows how to choose the perfect soulmate. Please let me know how I can help make your trip easier and more enjoyable. I Google-searched my mom into becoming an ordained minister. (We were married in the church of secular humanism, where admittance is free and the form is easy.) Since we had recalibrated our plans around one of my partners parents, I wanted my own to feel included too. Appointing her also meant we got to sidestep an awkward conversation about a Catholic wedding when, as a queer couple, we couldnt technically have one anyway. Quickly, this started to feel like our wedding, rather than a bag of lemons we were hopelessly juicing. Then came the question of wardrobe. There had to be some dress code Liam and I share a proclivity for exhausting opinions about clothing but we didnt want Michele to feel singled out, the only person dressed down (at this point, she was mostly wearing nightgowns, spending her days in bed). On the four-hour drive home after a weekend with Liams folks, it came to me. Two words: pajama wedding. Wrangling coordinating sets for our siblings and parents was pretty painless, and it would serve as an icebreaker for their first official meeting. (As they say: When youre nervous, imagine everyone in their underwear.) I had no trouble finding a veil I liked on Etsy, and even Liams outfit a tuxedo shirt and bow tie under a blue polka-dot set came together quickly. But youll never know how challenging it is to find an opaque white pajama set until you really need it. I ordered one with pearly pink piping from Brooks Brothers that, when worn, had the effect of dollar-store tissue paper. I ordered a white cotton set from Hanky Panky that was soft as silk but so thin you could see my birthmark through it. So I switched gears and picked up a tea-length La Perla bed jacket with a sweet collar and big satin buttons, its soft pink tones a dead ringer for those of the Chicago venue we passed up. Wearing it, I felt like Jackie Kennedy en fleece. Michele was a determined host. She arranged goodie bags for everyone who came from out of town that included candy, hot cocoa packs, and Washington, D.C., tourist mugs. We will be having white and dark turkey, cranberry walnut stuffing, mashed red or gold potatoes, candied sweets, green beans, she emailed my dad, whod recently been diagnosed with a gluten allergy. Please let me know what we can include so you will enjoy the meal despite the celiac disease you must combat. By this point, shed transitioned to palliative care, her condition beyond doctors control, but her sympathy wasnt tongue-in-cheek. Later, she put her hand to her chest, sighed, and said, Your poor dad I couldnt imagine a life without bread. On November 27, a few weeks before Michele died, we stood barefoot in front of a sectional sofa packed with our parents, siblings, and poorly behaved Boston terrier and exchanged vows. Liam picked a quote from Goodridge v. Department of Public Health, a landmark state court decision validating same-sex marriage: Marriage is the exclusive commitment of two individuals to each other, which nurtures love and mutual support Marriage is at once a deeply personal commitment to another human being and a highly public celebration of the ideals of mutuality, companionship, intimacy, fidelity, and family. There was no grand ballroom or second cousins, no DJ beyond Spotify chirping the Talking Heads out of tinny laptop speakers. And the three fake pre-lit Christmas trees flanking the fireplace werent what Id imagined when Michele said there would be plenty of string lights. But it felt like a real wedding. More importantly, it felt like ours.  View this image   Our final outing before the wedding was also the last wed ever have with Michele. We need to go out, she said from her bed, her voice a little raspy, to get some more decorations. Shed always worn wigs, but that Saturday night she was tired. Her hair was downy and gray, patchy in places. We offered to go shopping without her, but she scoffed. Im going. Liams dad, Frank, draped a blanket around the back of her wheelchair, and he pushed her around Michaels while Liam and I picked out artificial flowers and she found materials for a wreath. Id never heard of a wedding wreath, but door hangings were her crafting speciality. Thats not really in the color scheme, she said when Liam presented her with a lavender sprig, the palette he and I had agreed on. Im thinking more whites and silvers. Back at home, she told Frank how to put the wreath together. Youre the art director, he said, delicately placing white faux hydrangea blossoms into the wooden wreath base as she pointed to spots that needed filling in. Im just the hired hand. I watched Liam watching them, as Michele delivered careful instructions from her perch in their king-size bed and Frank did his best to make it happen. They were laughing. For the first time since Id met them, they seemed less like somebodys parents than a couple, making the best of it, whatever it was.

View this image  The centre will offer medical services staffed by doctors trained in LGBTI specific issues including gender dysphoria, transitioning and sexual health, and be free for anyone with a Medicare card. It will serve as a hub for LGBTI groups and organisations to share ideas and resources, with the aim to support equality, diversity and inclusion. View this image  Gender dysphoria is when people identify with a gender other than their birth-assigned gender, and want to make their body match their affirmed gender, either through counselling or transitioning. The $6.4 million in new funding will be allocated specifically to Monash Health- an agency that is struggling to treat the one hundred-plus patients who seek out its services every year. Last years budget gave additional funding to the Royal Childrens Hospital for gender dysphoria treatment for children aged 5 to 17, which they say doubled their capacity and halved their waiting list. The funding will help Monash Health expand their gender dysphoria clinic and deliver a more comprehensive multidisciplinary psychiatric and psychological assessment service, additional counselling services plus education and training to build clinical care for transgender Victorians.

Korra, 14 Emma Leslie Photography Australian photographer Emma Leslie asked transgender and gender-diverse children to design their own photo shoots for an exhibition titled Transcend: Portraits of Transgender and Gender Diverse Youth. View this image  Photographer Emma Leslie. Ashley Randall Photography Leslie told BuzzFeed News shes been working on the project since June 2015. It involved a lot of Facebook searches, Google searches, trying to find support groups, she said. Eventually, Leslie found Transcend, a support group for transgender children and their parents based in Melbourne. The exhibition, to show in Melbourne and Sydney this year, will feature 10 portraits of transgender and gender-diverse youth, taken in places and outfits chosen by the kids. Some of them wanted to be at the beach, in the city, some in their backyard, some in their house, said Leslie. I told them, you wear what you want, well work with that.

aS"The grocer seeks at least $100,000 in damages in the defamation suit. View this image  Jordan Brown Whole Foods Market on Tuesday sued a Texas pastor for defamation, saying that his allegation made in a lawsuit on Monday that the company inscribed a gay slur on a custom cake was false and that he had acted with malice to damage the companys reputation. Jordan Brown alleged he ordered a blank, pre-baked cake from a Whole Foods in Austin last week to be personalized with the words Love Wins, but after he picked it up, it instead said Love Wins Fag. He sued the company for intentionally inflicting emotional distress. In its counterclaim, Whole Foods said their employees did not put this slur on the cake, further alleging that Brown intentionally, knowingly, and falsely accused Whole Foods and its employees of writing the homosexual slur FAG on a custom made cake that he ordered. The company seeks damages of not less than $100,000, and also seeks sanctions against Browns attorney, Austin Kaplan. The company claims the lawsuit Kaplan filed on behalf of his client was signed without investigation into the truthfulness of the claims, and that it was groundless, brought in bad faith, and intended for the sole purpose of harassment. To bolster its case, Whole Foods released surveillance footage that it says shows Brown at the store, paying for a cake with a UPC label affixed to the top of the cake box. That surveillance footage contrasts with a video that Brown made, which showed the UPC sticker on the side of the box. In his video, Brown repeatedly said the box was still sealed. Mr. Brown admits that he was in sole possession and control of the cake until he posted his video, which showed the UPC label on the bottom and side of the box, the statement added. After reviewing our security footage of Mr. Brown, its clear that the UPC label was in fact on top of the cake box, not on the side of the package. This is evident as the cashier scans the UPC code on top of the box. youtube.com Brown, a pastor at a nondenominational Christian church, sued the grocer in Travis County District Court for intentionally inflicting emotional distress, arguing the company is responsible for its employees and failed to adequately respond when he complained about the cake last week. His lawyer, Austin Kaplan, posted the video that features Brown displaying the cake inside the box with the UPC label on the side and bottom. View this image  Via youtube.com Immediately after the lawsuit was filed on Monday, Whole Foods rejected Browns claims. The company countered the cake simply said Love Wins at the time of sale, and that it was made by a member of the LGBT community. By Tuesday, after the companys counter-suit, Kaplan had apparently removed a page from his firms website about the lawsuit he filed which listed documents relating to the suit and it instead said page not found. Brown and Kaplan did not respond to BuzzFeed News request to comment on Tuesday about Whole Foods allegations in the lawsuit, or the Browns claims were malicious and that Kaplan filed the lawsuit for the purpose of harassment.

aS'The Obama administration has taken the position that sex discrimination bans under federal law include protections against anti-transgender discrimination. On Tuesday, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that interpretation. [Update: On Friday, the school district announced that it will be asking the full court of appeals to review the ruling.] View this image  Dominic Holden/BuzzFeed WASHINGTON A federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld the Department of Educations interpretation of existing federal civil rights laws to protect transgender people against discrimination in education. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 decision, upheld the departments interpretation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which is that the laws ban on sex discrimination requires school districts to allow transgender people to use the restroom that corresponds with their gender identity. The Gloucester County School Board, however, passed a policy that restricts students to restrooms reflecting their biological gender. The transgender student who was targeted by the policy, Gavin Grimm, brought this lawsuit in federal court, seeking an injunction against enforcement of the boards policy. The decision is a big victory for the Obama administration, which weighed in at the appeals court to support Grimms challenge, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which has been making the case for protecting LGBT people under existing civil rights laws since 2012. The Education Department, for its part, has been pressing the Title IX interpretation with school districts since 2013. The appeals court had heard the arguments in January, and Tuesdays ruling is the first such appellate ruling in the country on the Obama administrations policy which it also has advanced regarding the sex discrimination ban under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Among the states included in the 4th Circuit is North Carolina, which recently passed a law limiting restroom use in government facilities including schools and universities to that which corresponds with a persons biological sex. The ACLU, which is backing Grimms suit, also has brought suit against the North Carolina law. The appeals court first held that the language of regulations implementing Title IX were ambiguous as to transgender restroom use and then finding that the departments interpretation of those regulations allowing transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds with their gender identity was a legitimate interpretation. We conclude that the Departments interpretation of its own regulation as it relates to restroom access by transgender individuals, is entitled to deference and is to be accorded controlling weight in this case, Judge Henry Floyd wrote for the court. The appeals court did not, however, grant the preliminary injunction Grimm is seeking, instead sending the case back to the district court to reconsider his request. Judge Andre Davis who agreed with Floyds decision for the court, including the decision to send the preliminary injunction request back to the district court did note that this Court would be on sound ground in granting the requested preliminary injunction on the undisputed facts in the record. Judge Paul Niemeyer, however, dissented from the appeals court decision, writing that the ruling overrules custom, culture, and the very demands inherent in human nature for privacy and safety, which the separation of such facilities is designed to protect. The appeals court in a portion of the opinion joined by all three judges on the panel also declined to reassign the case to another judge at this time. Grimms lawyers had asked for the case to be reassigned because of comments previously made during the case by U.S. District Court Judge Robert Doumar including calling being transgender a mental disorder. Floyd noted that, while Doumars comments in court were idiosyncratic, the appeals court concluded that the district courts written order in the case do not raise in our minds a question about the fundamental fairness of the proceedings. UPDATE On Friday, the Gloucester County School Board announced that it will be asking the full 4th Circuit to review the ruling en banc.

aS"Exclusive: A legal threat by the National AIDS Trust has triggered a rethink from NHS England over PrEP. Were delighted, the trust told BuzzFeed News. Justin Sullivan / Getty Images Getty The NHS in England is to reconsider its controversial decision not to provide the drug that prevents HIV, BuzzFeed News can reveal. Faced with the threat of legal action by one of Britains leading HIV charities, NHS Englands lawyers have said a dedicated committee will meet next month to look again at the pronouncement. The rethink represents a major victory for the National AIDS Trust (NAT), which sent NHS England a 17-page legal letter last week that laid out a string of reasons why the decision not to provide the drug was legally flawed. Late on Monday a week after NATs letter was sent NHS Englands lawyers wrote to the charity to say their client would re-examine its position in light of the intervention. NHS Englands Specialised Services Committee will now meet in late May to consider whether the basis for the original decision was sound. Were delighted, Deborah Gold, the chief executive of NAT, told BuzzFeed News. Were particularly delighted that when NHS England saw the strength of our legal case it made them rethink their position. But its really important that when they do that reconsideration that its a genuine, fair reassessment based on all of the facts, with an open mind. NAT will be responding in writing to NHS Englands lawyers to see if the review in May can be brought forward, Gold said. View this image  NAT The drug in question, Truvada, has been found to be highly effective, reducing the risk of infection by 86%. It is already available in the US, France, Canada, Kenya, and Israel, and when used in this prevention regime, is referred to as PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis). On 21 March NHS England announced that just 500 gay men would be given the drug. The decision sparked anger and dismay among the medical community, the HIV charity sector, and sexual health campaigners, as it abandoned a widely anticipated public consultation into PrEP that would have ticked one of the last boxes in an 18-month process for the NHS to commission the drug. Had this route been followed, the final referral to the NHS England Board which makes the ultimate decision was expected to have been made in June. The reason given by NHS England for shelving this process was that it is not responsible for HIV prevention, only HIV medication, and that local authorities were instead responsible for providing PrEP. This too was roundly criticised as many HIV experts highlighted that the NHS already provides the drug to people who have recently been exposed to the virus, as part of an intervention known as PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis). Meanwhile, local authorities denied it was their responsibility and pointed out that they had no budget to fund the medication. The Department of Health then admitted to BuzzFeed News that it did not know whose responsibility it was. Documents unearthed by BuzzFeed News also showed an apparent contradiction between NHS Englands position last year and its decision last month. View this image  Facebook / Terence Higgins Trust The legal letter sent from NAT to NHS England highlighted a wide range of areas in which the decision last month was open to legal challenge. These included: that NHS England had until March conveyed to interested parties that it was responsible for commissioning PrEP; that the decision on 21 March was made with no prior warning or consultation; that the rationale for this sudden change of position was not explained; that NHS England had misinterpreted the law and does in fact have a legal duty to commission drugs in this field. And finally, that by not doing so, NHS England could be seen to be contravening the Equality Act of 2010, due to the minorities who are most at risk of HIV infection. Mondays letter from NHS Englands lawyers outlined the process moving forward. The meeting by the Specialised Services Committee next month will re-examine whether NHS England is in fact responsible for commissioning PrEP and whether it has the power to fund it. If the committee decides it does have the duty and authority, it will refer the ultimate decision to the Clinical Priorities Advisory Group (CPAG). Because of the delay caused by the derailment of the original process, this referral will happen whether or not there is time for a public consultation. It is also possible, the letter said, that the CPAG meeting might be postponed a little in order to ensure PrEP is given proper consideration. View this image  prep4love.com We will still be watching and willing to instigate legal action at a later date if we arent successful in their reconsideration in May, Gold told BuzzFeed News. Were not walking away from this, but our preference is to solve it without having to take legal action. Last week, just before NATs letter was sent out, the charity met with NHS England to discuss its concerns. At that point they didnt seem willing to reconsider, said Gold. But after getting the letter from our solicitors I think it was then they realised what weve been saying all along which is theyve made an error in the law. Gold said the wider background to the announcement, with the press exposing issues surrounding the decision, and a backlash from communities most affected by the virus, will have played a part in triggering NHS Englands U-turn. Theyve very sensitive to this, she said. Ultimately, however, the charity remains focused on the final outcome. I hope this reconsideration gives NHS England the opportunity to take a step back and make a better decision. If HIV charities like NAT are successful and NHS England decides to fund PrEP, Gold said, people currently at high risk of HIV could have this extraordinary new treatment that could be a game-changer for HIV. Its the most important thing that has happened in HIV prevention since the discovery of antiretrovirals. It could therefore turn the tide on the HIV epidemic in a way that nothing else has.

aS"But the grocery chain counters the cake simply said Love Wins at the time of sale, and that it was made by a member of the LGBT community. View this image  Jordan Brown A Texas pastor filed a lawsuit Monday alleging he ordered a custom cake from a Whole Foods Market inscribed with the words Love Wins, but after he picked it up, it instead said, Love Wins Fag. Jordan Brown, a pastor at a nondenominational Christian church, is suing the grocery chain for intentionally inflicting emotional distress, arguing the company is responsible for its employees and failed to adequately respond when he complained about the cake last week. He filed a photo of the cake along with his lawsuit. The company had every opportunity to stop something like this from happening, and if you look at the picture, the companys name is right on the box, said Austin Kaplan, a lawyer representing Brown. As far as were concerned, the company is to blame here. Whole Foods, however, wholly denies the allegations. In a statement sent to BuzzFeed News, the grocery chain said an employee in the bakery department wrote Love Wins at the top of the cake as requested by the guest, and thats exactly how the cake was packaged and sold at the store. Further, the company said, We stand behind our bakery team member, who is part of the LGBTQ community, and the additional team members from the store, who confirmed the cake was decorated with only the message Love Wins. At about noon on April 14, Brown visited a Whole Foods in Austin where he selected a blank, pre-baked cake and asked an employee in the bakery department to personalize it with the words Love Wins a slogan used to celebrate the Supreme Courts ruling for marriage equality. The employee took the cake to the prep table and began writing on it in icing, the lawsuit filed in Travis County District Court continues. She then sealed it with a Whole Foods sticker, and handed it to Pastor Jordan. Once it was sealed, there was no way to alter the cake without breaking the Whole Foods sticker. Jordan did not notice the word fag on the cake until he was in his car, the suit says, so he called the store to complain. Two hours later, a manager told him, Whole Foods had come to the conclusion that the store had not done anything wrong, and that their bakery associate had done nothing wrong, the complaint said. Pastor Jordan asked [the manager] directly, If the bakery associate did not do this, then who wrote this on my cake? [The manager] responded to the effect of, I dont know, and we cant help you, and hung up the phone. Pastor Jordan spent the remainder of the day in tears, says the suit, which seeks a jury trial and compensation for emotional damages. It is impossible to calculate the emotional distress that these events have caused. Kaplan, the lawyer, said his client only went to court because the company failed to apologize. We thought Whole Foods would take this seriously. We have no choice but to file a lawsuit. He also doubted the companys claim that it hadnt written the offensive term, saying, That cake was sealed. The icing was the same. Its so disappointing and frustrating. Whole Foods also seems frustrated. Our team members do not accept or design bakery orders that include language or images that are offensive, the company said in a statement. Whole Foods Market has a zero tolerance policy for discrimination. Texas lacks a statewide law banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. On the other hand, the city of Austin does prohibit such discrimination. Kaplan said he may pursue a remedy under the citys ordinance. The Austin Human Rights Commission meets on Monday, and I expect that we will be there, Kapaln said. He said he wants to work with Whole Foods so this never happens to someone else. youtube.com View this embed   Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The state has the third largest population of LGBT people in the country and Hillary Clintons campaign is targeting them this week as they seek victory in Tuesdays key primary election. View this image  Jonathan Pearson, right, said at a rally on Sunday, I think that LGBT people are for Hillary, especially in New York. BuzzFeed News / Dominic Holden The 300 or so people hollering for their candidate in Manhattans West Village on Sunday were mostly in their 20s and 30s, they were mostly white, and the men outnumbered women by roughly five to one. Based on those demographics, it looked like a prototypical Bernie Sanders crowd. But this was a rally for Hillary Clinton and these younger fans were mostly gay. Attempting to rebound from a series of recent primary defeats, Clinton backers want to reverse Sanders momentum by trouncing him in New Yorks primary election, a state where voters remember Clinton as their former U.S. senator and have given her a lead in early polls. The campaign hopes to expand that margin on Tuesday despite a frenzy of urban support for Sanders in part by locking down LGBT New Yorkers, who have long been Clintons stalwarts at the ballot and bank. Get out on Election Day, and make sure she wins in a landslide! New York City Councilmember Corey Johnson, a gay representative of the LGBT-populous neighborhoods on Manhattans west side, bellowed into the mic. Johnson stood in front of two giant rainbow H logos on a stage pointedly located outside the front door of the Stonewall Inn, a landmark where riots nearly 50 years ago catalyzed the contemporary LGBT-rights movement. Clinton campaign staff told BuzzFeed News they have focused LGBT outreach for the state in New York City. The LGBT population is very concentrated in the five boroughs, Dominic Lowell, the campaigns LGBT outreach director, said last week. They are one of her strongest sources of support. They are a key group for us. The campaign has circulated 22,000 pieces of literature promoting her record on LGBT rights, run banner ads on gay blogs with a large local readership, and pinpointed LGBT neighborhoods for canvasses. Numerous LGBT groups have helped with outreach such as wrangling volunteers and staffing phone banks, including the Stonewall Democrats and Human Rights Campaign. The audience at Clintons Manhattan rally on Sunday cheered with gusto like audiences at her rallies in the citys other four boroughs but still, the turnout was a tiny fraction of a Sanders rally Sunday across town in Brooklyns Prospect Park. Whoa our largest rally yet, the Sanders campaign said in a tweet, which pegged attendance at 28,356 attendees. While Sanders has harnessed the enthusiasm of many young voters, the gap between the Clinton campaign and younger voters in New York City has at times seemed strained. View this image  Dominic Holden/BuzzFeed News We need you to tweet, and Instagram, and Facebook whatever else the kids have come up with, former City Councilmember Christine Quinn told the crowd, looking around and searching to name another social media platform. And Snapchat! she declared. The Sanders campaign did not reply to BuzzFeed Newss request to comment on its efforts to mobilize LGBT voters in New York. Whether it sees the LGBT population in New York as key for the primary is unclear. But the numbers of those voters are impossible to ignore. New York has the third-largest population of LGBT people in the United States, with roughly 570,000 LGBT adults, according to estimates based on 2013 Gallup survey data. Nationally, that population is three times more likely to lean Democratic than Republican, again according to Gallups research. Does Clinton have an edge with these voters? Even her supporters disagree. I think that LGBT people are for Hillary, especially in New York, because they had experience with her as their senator, Jonathan Pearson, 29, told BuzzFeed News as attendees left her rally. As a gay man, he said he can personally relate to Clinton, who was pummeled by conservatives during her husbands administration and has risen nonetheless. I know what its like to be marginalized, he said. I think she faced a double-standard. She cant do anything without criticism when others are given a free pass. Data on Clintons LGBT support is limited, but she has prevailed over Sanders in some primary contests with heavy LGBT representation. In the famously gay beach town of Provincetown, Massachusetts, Clinton won about 64% of the Democratic primary vote this year. In Miami Beach, Florida, she took about 66%. Likewise, in the LGBT enclave of Wilton Manors, Florida, she won over 70%. Voter polls rarely break out LGBT results its too small a sample within most surveys to be statistically significant but Community Marketing Incorporated, an LGBT market research firm, released the results of a national poll of likely LGBT voters on Feb. 15 that found Clinton leading. Among likely LGBT voters, Clinton got 48% of the vote to Sanderss 41%. Not just appealing for those voters, Clinton has enlisted a bevy of celebrity and political surrogates to maintain a calendar of fundraisers. Among the ambassadors is Billie Jean King, the former tennis star, who told BuzzFeed News in a phone call Friday night the she has flown to Iowa and New Hampshire, making three stops a day both to rev up volunteers and raise money. Theres a lot of driving, she said. Now helping Clinton in her home state of New York, King said she believes LGBT people tend to support Clinton in part because theyve seen her targeted in witch hunts. I think it helps our community to have compassion for her, she said. But moreover, We think she is the most qualified. Its a no-brainer. Obama has been the best thing that ever happened to our community, and she is going to continue that. King has raised money in the city, appearing in March with fellow lesbian celebrities Rosie ODonnell and Cynthia Nixon in a posh downtown Manhattan fundraiser. Clintons campaign said its LGBT Finance Council, one of several fundraising committees in the campaign, is the largest of it finance councils and has raised the most money. But it did not provide figures. King added she was glad Clinton has evolved on same-sex marriage, tacitly acknowledging one of the candidates weaker points running against Sanders on an LGBT-rights platform. Sanders has stressed that he supported marriage equality before Clinton, pointing to his vote against the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996. Clinton supported a partial repeal of that law in 2008, but she did not state her support for full marriage equality until 2013, when she famously explained, I evolved over time. She said she evolved. Thats what I want to hear, King said. King and numerous other Clinton supporters touted Clintons tenure as secretary of state, when she delivered a speech at the United Nations in Geneva in 2011 proclaiming LGBT rights are human rights. In her current White House run, Clinton also issued a policy paper detailing her vision for federal and foreign LGBT rights. But Clinton has flummoxed LGBT supporters at points during this campaign, initially claiming in an interview that DOMA was a defensive action attempting to stop a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage a claim for which BuzzFeed News found no contemporary evidence. More recently, she also mischaracterized former First Lady Nancy Reagan as starting a national dialogue about AIDS a flap that led Clinton to apologize and raised questions about whether she had fully engaged with LGBT issues before they were political advantageous. Still, many supporters believe her pragmatic, unrushed approach to policy change will be better suited to navigating a presidents limited authority. View this image  Chelsea Clinton, left, and former New York City Councilmember Christine Quinn at the LGBT Community Center last week. BuzzFeed News / Dominic Holden That was key for Jane Marlow, who wore an Out and ready for Hillary T-shirt at an event featuring Chelsea Clinton at the LGBT center in Manhattan last week. Marlow praised Clintons UN speech and forgave President Bill Clintons signing of DOMA, saying Hillary cant be responsible for unavoidable political compromises made by her husband. She is strategic and incremental, said Marlow, who argued Hillary could maintain Obamas LGBT agenda in courts, federal agencies, and foreign governments. She knows where she needs to go and the steps in between. But not all LGBT Clinton supporters think she actually has a leg up with LGBT voters. Andres Batancur, 36, for example, said, I think its equal, then pausing. I honestly think its equal. Nevertheless, Clinton performed especially well among New Yorks gay, lesbian, and bisexual voters in her 2008 presidential run. They favored Clinton over Obama by 23 percentage points in New York and 34 percentage points in California, the only states that asked voters about their sexual orientation in exit polls, the New York Times reported. Of course, Clinton ultimately lost that primary race that year. Logan Yost, 34, was in New York at the time and attended the Clinton rally on Sunday wearing a shirt printed with Clinton and a rainbow. She wasnt for marriage equality, but neither was Barack Obama, and I voted for him, he told BuzzFeed News. Some people are vehemently against her, he acknowledged, but if you cant admit that shes the most qualified person to run for president in your lifetime, you are full of crap.

aS'Gay pride? View this image  View this image  View this image  View this image  According to our guide they had only started their behavior that same week. These intruder males had pushed out the resident males earlier in the year and the other female lions had headed into the Mopani woodlands, an area difficult to access with a safari vehicle. Only one lioness was seen in the center of the concession where the male lions were and the lions showed no interest in the lioness leading to the assumption that she may have been pregnant. One of the lions was wearing a collar and our guide thought that they may have crossed from Namibia. It is the first time I have seen homosexual behavior in lions but when reading about it upon my return, it is not that uncommon. With the light just around sunset, it gave some spectacular images. View this image  According to the Yale Scientific, homosexual behavior has been documented in 450 different species. In his 1999 book Biological Exuberance, Bruce Bagemihl, Ph.D., former professor of biology at the University of British Columbia, cited several of examples of same-sex mating behavior in animals, including lions.

aS"You may not realize it, but the person on the other side of your customer service phone call might be transgender. On calls, Filipino workers can safely adopt womens voices, names, and clothing, all while earning a decent wage. But their success at work doesnt protect them from the discrimination they face outside of it. It was 8 p.m. on a rainy Thursday night in Manila. Clad in a sleek black dress with three-quarter-length sleeves, Angel Panitan waved her ID in front of a uniformed guard in the lobby of the Raffles Building in the middle-class Philippine district of Pasig. The guard nodded in recognition without looking at Angels card, which showed not just the female name shes been known as since 2007, but the male name she was given legally at birth. Angel walked confidently to the elevator bays and greeted several co-workers, including a woman she manages. At the reception desk, Angel asked me to wait on a tan faux-leather bench where some trainees were chatting jovially in Tagalog about getting their IDs, while Angel spoke to her compliance officer to get clearance for me to go inside. Security is tight in call centers, since companies are worried about protecting client data, but after a few minutes, Angel returned and motioned for me to come through. View this image  Workers umbrellas at the entrance to the TREC Pacific Call Center, where Angel works. Meredith Talusan / BuzzFeed News In the Philippines, transgender women get no recognition from the national government, let alone legal protections. They cannot change their names or gender markers on any legal documents, even if they have sex reassignment surgery. There are LGBT employment protections in some areas of Manila, but not in Pasig, where Angel works. Even when these protections are applied to transgender women in the Philippines such as in one case when a trans woman was barred from using the womens room at work and filed discrimination charges they are officially classified as homosexual men. Yet, against these odds, Angel is the boss. The 31-year-old manages 29 call center agents and a rotating crop of trainees at TREC, overseeing the quality of their work, taking particularly difficult calls called escalations, and reporting to the centers United States office. And she isnt alone. View this image  A call center in Manila. Bloomberg / Getty Images In the Philippines, call centers have become havens for gender-nonconforming people, a place where they can experiment with their gender presentation and identity. Since most of the labor takes place over the phone, employees assigned male at birth may adopt traditionally feminine names, take on a female voice, or wear womens clothing while talking to customers, a freedom that would be impossible in most other industries in the country. For decades, beauty parlors were a rare refuge where gender-variant Filipinas could openly work, at the expense of low wages. But today call centers are the new beauty parlor, said Naomi Fontanos, the head of a major Philippine transgender organization and herself a former call center worker. Call centers emerged in the country in the mid-2000s, and eventually displaced India as the industrys global leader. Companies like IBM, JPMorgan, and eBay have set up customer service operations in the Philippines; as descendants of American colonization, Filipinos often speak English with lighter accents and have greater access to American culture than Indians, who were colonized by the British. There are now more than 1 million call center workers in a country of 98 million, and the industry accounts for an estimated 10% of the Philippine economy. Because trans women in the Philippines are legally classified as men, there are no reliable statistics to quantify their numbers in the industry. But Emmanuel David, an assistant professor in women and gender studies at the University of Colorado, Boulder, is working on a book about the subject and confirms their substantial presence in these companies. In one of his interviews, one woman even claimed that 3 out of 4 workers in her company are trans. According to David, this is because trans women talk among themselves and congregate in workplaces that have a reputation for being trans-friendly. David said that trans women act as emotional shock-absorbers who become indispensable for livening up overnight shifts and dealing with the Western customers they cater to. And because customers only hear them on the phone, those who would balk at being served by a trans woman are none the wiser. Since women are often perceived as more comforting than men, presenting as women on the phone can actually advance call center workers careers. In fact, Angel said that many call center employees she knows first took on a female persona while on the phone with customers long before they personally identified as trans. Whats more, success at work can give those with nascent trans identities the confidence to present as women in real life. In call centers, we are embraced and celebrated not because of our gender and who we are, Angel told me, but we are equally treated because of what we produce and perform in the company. The call center industry has thus not only promoted transgender women, but actually shaped their identities in fundamental ways. Today, many of the most prominent trans leaders in the country are former call center workers. Trans women often dont enter the call center as trans, David said. The wages help enable and produce that identity. View this image  Angel Panitan Jake Verzosa for BuzzFeed News Angel did not grow up thinking she would be a call center worker, just as she didnt grow up thinking she was trans. In the 1990s, in the rural province of Pangasinan, 125 miles north of Manila, Angel thought of herself as bakla, an indigenous identity that Filipinos think of as third-gender, distinct from either boys or girls. Angel offered details of her childhood as she walked through the main call center floor, an open space with a low drop ceiling, bathed dimly in fluorescent light. (Unlike typical American workspaces, the walls were painted teal and the cubicle dividers were fuchsia, reflecting a Filipino taste for bright colors.) My brother played with cars, but I stole my sisters dolls, Angel said. That was when I started to think I am bakla. Feminine boys dont face as much stigma in the Philippines compared to the U.S., because of its long indigenous history of third-gender people. People assigned male at birth who grow up to identify as bakla are typically permitted to have feminine mannerisms and sometimes even wear girls clothes or accessories but cant grow their hair long or wear dresses, which would risk having them be mistaken for girls. Even when I was a kid, my family really knew that Im bakla. Id rather wear girls than boys tops, Angel said. However, her mom did not allow her to wear dresses or skirts and pressured her to wear mens clothing when she became an adult. Angel presented as male the first time she entered the call center industry in 2005, like the vast majority of workers who now identify as trans women. And it was actually on the phone that she was first perceived as a woman, by American customers calling from abroad. I have a feminine voice, Angel said, so customers kept calling me maam during training. That was when Angels supervisor started allowing her to use a female alias, first Madison, which rhymes with her legal name, and then eventually Angel, the name she now uses both in and out of work. That first experience of being affirmed and treated seamlessly as a woman by American customers profoundly influenced her desire to identify as a woman in the rest of her life. I realized how much I enjoyed being feminine, Angel said. And I discovered there was a big advantage as a woman over the phone. When a man is irate I can be sweet to them, and women customers are nicer to their own gender. She also noted that because homophobic customers would often ask for another agent if they detected a gay mans voice, which could lead to a bad evaluation, workers are forced to affect conventionally male or female voices. Its often easier for bakla to shift to a female voice rather than affect a masculine male voice, and a portion of those third-gender people then go on to identify as transgender women. Eventually, Angels wages and financial independence also enabled her to dress as a woman. When Im earning, I have my own money, thats the time Im buying my own clothes, so my [mens] underwear becomes panties, Angel said. She met other trans women who told her about using oral contraceptives to increase her estrogen levels. Thats when I started transitioning, she said. I like to dress, I like to wear womens clothes. And then I really lived like a woman. Call center work has given Angel the financial freedom to determine how to dress and look, away from the pressures of her family. Because of trans peoples lack of legal rights in the country, there is no transgender-specific medical care available to Angel, so she takes oral contraceptives to get her estrogen. Angel also takes Androcur, a medicine used to treat advanced prostate cancer by blocking testosterone production, thats available over the counter in the Philippines. Angels income has also allowed her to obtain feminizing surgeries and treatments that she couldnt have afforded without her call center wages. My birthday present to myself the first year I started working at the call center in 2005 was a nose job, she said. Since then, shes had collagen injections on her forehead, cheeks, chin, breasts, and hips, as well as a touch-up for her nose job. All of the trans women I know have had procedures done to their hips, chest, or face, she added. These procedures have added up to several thousand dollars, which Angel saved from her $750-a-month income at the call center. Before the advent of that industry, the only other jobs where Angel could have presented as female were in the beauty industry, where she would have been fortunate to earn $150 a month as a hairstylist or makeup artist. Angels mother wanted her to be a teacher, but she wanted to be able to dress in feminine clothing and go by her chosen name at work. When youre a [male] teacher in the Philippines, you have to dress in mens clothes, she said. You have to be a man. I dont want to become a teacher, because what would I wear? Slacks, polo shirts? I dont see myself dressing that way, so I said no! Angel thrives as a call center worker, having been with her company for eight years and promoted several times. She started out as a regular worker, fielding customer service calls for Verifone, a company that makes credit card machines. These days, she serves as one of two team leaders who manage Verifones 60-person account. Unlike some of University of Colorado professor Davids subjects, Angel works in an environment without a particularly high proportion of trans women. There are three other trans women shes aware of at TREC, who, along with her, account for just 1% of the companys 400-person workforce. But this makes it all the more striking that shes a high-level manager, as she leads a team that consists exclusively of cisgender men and women. Not only that, but she does so in a country that has the greatest gender parity in the Asia-Pacific region, with a greater proportion of women in most government and professional sectors compared to the U.S. Angels status as a trans woman does not seem to have hurt her prospects. Being trans may have even boosted Angels career, as she has carved out an enthusiastic and entertaining presence in her company. Im quite active in team-building events. I can really be relied upon for my creativity for things like pageants, sports fests, and Christmas parties. Im always visible in those occasions, she said. But its also about my performance, my attendance and punctuality. Bakla have a long reputation in the Philippines as entertainers singers, dancers, and comedians. Theyre thought to be funny, dramatic, and relentlessly energetic, great qualities to have on shifts that last through the night. (Most of the employees at TREC work during American business hours, 9 a.m to 5 p.m. ET, which corresponds to 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. in the Philippines.) But Angel is also quick to distance herself from some of the stigmas associated with bakla, even those who now identify as trans. Because bakla and trans women often have limited employment options, they have a reputation as sex workers. I know a lot of prostitutes, Angel said. Theyre graduates of schools. Theyre graduates of some courses. Its a waste. Government estimates put the number of sex workers in the Philippines as high as 800,000, many of whom take on this type of work because of poverty and a lack of employment opportunities and, consequently, face violence and discrimination. There are no reliable statistics on how many of these workers are transgender. Angel was particularly critical of trans women who do sex work and spend their earnings on luxuries like Louis Vuitton bags or fancy clothes. Do they have savings? Angel asked. They bought that very expensive bag. How about their family? Is their family still eating? I know these people, and I know theyre not wealthy. Useless extravagance, just to buy something expensive. While she spoke, I couldnt help but think that her dismissal of sex workers reflected her own anxieties about her status in Filipino society. The relatively high wages in call centers may shield trans women there from the conditions that precipitate sex work, but they still run into economic difficulties. According to David, the women he interviewed had mixed experiences when it came to hiring and promotion, and many have not been as fortunate as Angel. A lot of those I spoke with were in entry-level positions, although a number I did speak with were managers or supervisors, but thats after many, many years of being there. They didnt just magically appear in those leadership positions, he said. Based on his interviews, David believes that trans workers still encounter significant obstacles in promotion and regularly perform functions that are not strictly part of their job, like the organizing or entertaining that Angel described. However, David conducted the bulk of his interviews between 2009 and 2012. Conditions could have improved since that time. For her part, Angel feels that working at TREC shields her not just from the requirement to wear mens clothes, but from other forms of discrimination that are common with trans women in the Philippines, such as verbal harassment and outright exclusion from public spaces. People may question or deny her gender identity outside the walls of the call center, but within its confines, Angel feels confident and secure. View this image  Trixie Maristela Jake Verzosa for BuzzFeed News At 10 p.m. and in full makeup, Trixie Maristela languidly entered Starbucks in the posh district of Bonifacio Global City wearing an orange sleeveless dress, after taping a segment for a news documentary show. She has become one of the Philippines most recognizable trans women, having recently won Miss International Queen, the most well-known international pageant for trans women, which is held annually in Pattaya, Thailand. Her success has led to a talent contract from Viva, one of the countrys foremost talent agencies and film production companies. Sitting across from me, Trixie looked like someone out of anime, with her long false lashes, prominent eyes, and slim nose. Her success has come seemingly overnight. Less than a year ago, she was a call center worker like Angel. From town festivals to schools, television to companies, pageants are ubiquitous in the Philippines, especially as Filipina women have excelled in major international pageants like Pia Wurtzbachs controversial win in this years Miss Universe. So-called gay pageants are known as venues for bakla and trans women to not just display their beauty, but also impress and entertain. In a televised pageant in 2014, for instance, Trixie was asked why she should win the crown. She replied in a mix of English and Tagalog: Aside from the undeniable fact that I look gorgeous today, I slept for eight hours and its plainly visible that Im very fresh. The others look haggard. Thats all. Thank you. The pageant culture and the call center culture are intertwined, David said. He spoke to several women who supplemented their income through beauty pageants, as Trixie and Angel both have. Sometimes theyll even hold pageants in the call center, David added. Its like a company picnic. People want to go to work and have fun and not feel stressed out. Stuff like that can relieve stressful situations. View on Instagram Instagram: @trixiemaristela Trixie worked as a multilingual senior business analyst for Accenture, one of the largest business process outsourcing companies in the world, a job she quit when she won a prestigious local pageant, Miss Gay Manila, this past June. That win led to her invitation to participate in Miss International Queen. Trixie credits her call center work, especially her mastery of English, as a big asset in her pageant success. In the call center industry, its a must that you know English language, she said. In most beauty pageants if they hear you speak impeccable English its a plus factor. So it helped a lot. Trixie also traces the origins of her trans identity to the early days of her call center work, while she was still in college in 2006 at the University of the Philippines, Diliman, the most prestigious public university in the country. As a European languages and literature major, Trixie was exposed to gender theorists from the West, wrote her college thesis on transgender representation in the films of Pedro Almodvar, and joined an LGBT student group. Thats how I learned about the differences between gays, bisexuals, and trans, Trixie said. Before that I just used the term bakla to refer to all of them. Trixies early experiences in the call center industry werent as positive as Angels. Back in college the environment wasnt so great, she said. I had a problem using the female restroom because they didnt understand the term transgender yet. Back then, one company told me, We can accept you but you cant cross-dress, you have to cut your hair, you have to wear business attire for males. I was surprised because, for some companies, its more important for you to dress up based on what they think you are instead of who you think you are. Trixie said that she applied to Accenture in 2011 and was told she couldnt use the womens restroom. She refused to work there because of the policy, and she ended up taking a job offer elsewhere. Using the female restroom is very important to me, she said. Its only when I reapplied in 2013 that their policy had changed. Over email, Accentures managing director of global inclusion and diversity, Nellie Borrero, responded to Trixies account by writing in part: Gender identity and gender expression have been included in our global policy since 2010 and we are making progress putting this into practice across our local offices. She noted that theyve made yearly progress in rolling out gender-neutral bathrooms, while taking local regulations and leasing restrictions into account. Though not directly confirming Trixies experience, Borrero and Accentures own diversity documents show that transgender-inclusive policies take time to implement, which may account for the difference between her experiences in 2011 and 2013. In being a company that is incredibly diverse, Borrero wrote in conclusion, we strive to accommodate transgender employees and visitors by finding solutions that are safe, convenient and respectful. We are committed to progressing as we continue to be strong advocates for inclusion. Indeed, a section of Accentures policy documents details the prohibition of harassment on the basis of gender identity and gender expression in all countries, including where there is no protection under local laws. Extending transgender-inclusive policies developed in the United States to Filipino workers, even when there are no local laws that prohibit discrimination, is starkly different from other Philippine professional sectors, where those who are legally born male are routinely required to wear masculine clothes and have little legal recourse if theyre discriminated against for presenting as female. Angel herself isnt entirely free to fully identify as a woman, even at her transgender-inclusive workplace. Companies must conform to government policies, and because Angel cant change her legal name, her birth name still appears on her company ID. An even bigger issue in her day-to-day life is that while there is one single-stall restroom inside TREC, common mens and womens rooms are shared among several companies in her building and are controlled by building management. Because Angel is not in full control of her breaks, she has no choice but to use a restroom that does not conform to her gender if a co-worker happens to be using the lone unisex restroom at work. I was caught once and the guard took a picture of me, then asked me to pay a fine, Angel said. After that I stopped going to the womens room. I have to go to the mens room now if the single bathroom is taken. Trans women have grown increasingly intolerant of discrimination after exposure to trans-inclusive companies at call centers. Despite her celebrity, Trixie herself, along with fashion designer Veejay Floresca, was denied entry into Valkyrie, a high-end nightclub in the Taguig district, last June and posted about her experience on Facebook. She joined several leaders of trans organizations in the Philippines in a meeting with Valkyrie management Naomi Fontanos from GANDA Filipinas, Dindi Tan from the Association for Transgender Philippines, and Meggan Evangelista from Babaylanes Inc. all of whom are former call center workers. The group convinced Valkyrie management to lift their no-cross-dressing policy and formulate training guidelines for their employees. My vision is to make the trans community empowered and that later on there would be no more Valkyrie issues, Trixie said. Im not really looking for special treatment, just for trans [people] to be respected and not necessarily be assimilated, but for their talents and skills to be distinguished and to be recognized as well. View this image  Giles Po Jake Verzosa for BuzzFeed News Unlike Trixie and Angel, who like wearing dresses and skirts, Giles Po a manager for Sutherland Global Services, another multinational call center met me before work wearing a gray T-shirt, jeans, and canvas sneakers. Sitting at Starbucks on a sunny and humid afternoon, her hand brushed against her long, thick hair as she waved hello to a group of men presumably co-workers a couple of whom said hello back. With a touch of lipstick on and no other makeup, she smiled widely, revealing a mouthful of braces. Sutherlands clients include large internet companies like eBay and PayPal, and Giles specifically directs day-to-day logistics and operations for a team that does customer service for eBay in the U.K. She is legally assigned male but often perceived as a woman, though she doesnt care what gender people think she is she even finds it validating when people get confused. Its fine with me if people are going to call me gay, if theyre going to call me transgender, or whatnot, Giles said, her gold-plated rings rapping against the table. As long as there is dignity when they address me as a person, because what I would like to make sure is that when I face people, theyre going to see me as a person, not anyone else, not any other thing. Unlike Angel and Trixie, who are firm in their identities as trans women, Giles gender identity is harder to describe. She is routinely perceived as a cisgender woman by strangers, but moves and speaks in the theatrical and flamboyant manner associated with bakla. She has not taken hormones or undergone feminizing procedures, nor does she want to. She is also fine with using the mens restroom. Giles in-between position frustrates people like Trixie, who want trans women in the Philippines to enjoy the same rights as they do in the United States and believes that complacency hinders progress. She echoed the sentiments of a number of university-trained trans women Ive met, who view Giles position as uneducated and provincial. Many Filipinos, theyre not as educated about the West, Trixie said. They dont know about the rights that Americans have, and they dont understand that if you feel yourself to be a woman, you can live your life as a woman even if you are transgender. For his part, researcher David is concerned that over time, trans women will increasingly distance themselves from bakla, and that gains trans women make in terms of respect and rights may not eventually apply to more marginalized, less respectable gender categories. If trans women in the Philippines are able to win legal recognition that will allow them to legally change their names and gender markers on government documents, they can live as women without having to disclose their trans identity, and be treated better compared to bakla. Many trans women position themselves as the good citizen worthy of rights, David said. And that positioning is sometimes done by distancing themselves from people who are seen as uneducated, or not decent, or loud, or engaged in sex work. Though she herself is clear about her transgender identity, Angel doesnt believe that bakla will be unduly marginalized even if trans women continue to gain rights. I think its always going to be more acceptable for Filipino families to have a bakla rather than a trans family member, she said. While the existence of people like Giles who confuse gender categories might make it more difficult to define and obtain rights for trans women, Angel believes that theres room for multiple identities to thrive. I have many different friends: gay, bisexual, and trans. I think we can all be happy together, Angel said. View this image  Taguig district, Metro Manila, the Philippines. Jon Bilous / Alamy On her day off, Angel sat in a modest room in Pasig, in the house of a former co-worker. She was living cheaply as a boarder instead of getting her own apartment, because she hopes to someday start her own handbag business. Her mother was still a seven-hour bus ride north, and her three other siblings were either working abroad or in other parts of the country. They have an ongoing group chat on Facebook, where they say hello and post pictures almost every day. She showed me pictures of her family as we sat together on the bottom of her bunk bed, with boxes of her clothes piled on top. Outside of the workplace, Angel revealed more of the struggles and indignities she and other trans women have to bear in Philippine culture. Even as she experiences a certain amount of social acceptance, and her company allows her to work and even to be a manager, Angel still encounters many obstacles in her daily life. The pervasiveness of Catholicism after the Philippines centuries as a Spanish colony has made Filipinos deeply conservative in certain ways, particularly in their family structures. A clear example of this contradiction between social tolerance and institutional discrimination is Angels relationship with her then-boyfriend, Marvin, whom shed been dating for two years. Marriage and children are still generally considered to be default conditions in the Philippines, and a wedding wasnt possible for the two of them trans women are recognized as men legally, and same-sex marriage isnt legal. Furthermore, Filipino children are expected to obey their parents even as adults, and Marvins Catholic parents would never allow him to be in a permanent relationship with Angel, who they saw as bakla. Marvin himself had expressed doubt about their future. My boyfriend always reminds me that he will someday get married to someone else, Angel said, her usually confident voice tinged with melancholy. Marvin wants to have children, she said, and thats why he thinks they cant be together forever. Angel also said that its common for men in the Philippines to marry real women, but continue to see transgender women as mistresses. Since it was her day off and she wanted to relax, Angel and I decided to get massages in the posh Taguig district at The Spa, a popular establishment that has several branches all over Metro Manila. We filled out forms with our information and health waivers; they didnt ask us for identification. Then the receptionist asked us to sit down. Angel and I sat on wire mesh lounge chairs as the women whispered among themselves, something about showers. Eventually, a woman in a black suit who looked like she was in charge motioned me over to talk. She asked us if we could shower separately, rather than using the common facilities for women. I asked her why we couldnt use the womens locker room. I think your companionAngel? Is shea girl? the manager asked. Yeah, I replied. So she can share the steam room with other Yeah, she can share the steam room with other women. Yeah, becauseso its all right. Its only then that the manager allowed us to go to the womens side of the spa facility. After our massages, Angel and I had dinner at Abe, a restaurant that serves regional Filipino food. What I really felt was shame, Angel said between bites, referring to the managers invasive question. So I just tried not to pay attention. The truth is, I was shocked. She described another incident, at a restaurant and bar called Aruba in 2007. She was with a school friend who was visiting from Canada along with four of their other schoolmates, but the security guard refused to let Angel in because they have a no-cross-dressing policy. They told me I couldnt go in, but there was a dog inside, she said. My friend told them, Whats the difference between that creature and my friend? Earlier this month, Angel told me that, under immense pressure from his parents, Marvin broke up with her. He exchanged me for a real woman, she chatted me in Tagalog over Facebook. Its heartbreaking but true. She added that Marvin wanted to keep seeing her in secret but she refused. Even though Angel has been discriminated against numerous times for having a body that doesnt match peoples perceptions of womanhood and even though the discrimination she faces would likely be lessened if she passed more as a cisgender woman she has no plans to undergo genital surgery. Im happy with that part of my body the way it is, she said. I know trans women whove had surgery and havent been satisfied, so many of us dont want to have surgery. Its too big of a risk. Angel has been really happy with her sex life and doesnt want to potentially compromise it just to fit societys expectations. However, she admitted she would have to think twice if the law changed and the Philippine government made genital surgery a condition to be legally classified as a woman still a requirement in many U.S. states which would shield her from much of the discrimination she experiences. Angel expressed resentment that theres a possibility, even a likelihood that genital surgery will become a government requirement. Change of name and gender marker shouldnt be that hard to achieve, she said. Angel believes that the government simply needs to consult Western clinical studies on gender identity and expression to come to the conclusion that surgery shouldnt be required to be legally classified as a woman. Angel looks up to Trixie as an example of an ideal trans woman who has used her newfound celebrity for greater rights and recognition of trans women in the Philippines. Im lucky that now, if I go to a place like Valkyrie, I will not be discriminated against because of women like Trixie, she said. In particular, Angel admires the way Trixie has handled herself both in her politics and in her life, as the beauty queen has been the subject of numerous interviews and TV segments since her win at Miss International Queen. Angel knows that Trixie has a longtime partner, Art Santa Ana, and spent a period of time several years ago hiding her trans status for the sake of his family. I understand why she did that, Angel said, and I envy her for having a boyfriend who is willing to publicly say he is with her. Most of all, Angel admires Trixie for changing perceptions of trans women in the Philippines as they move away from the legacy of their bakla identity and conduct themselves with grace and dignity. Trixie is an activist by means of giving education to people. She doesnt go to the streets, Angel said. Thats the right way for people to see trans people. Were not just the stereotype, working on the street or at the salon. Were normal. Were educated. Were respectable.  View this embed   Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS'Trans women are often denied their sexuality at every turn: by potential partners who treat us like a fetish, and by medical professionals who know woefully little about the sexual side effects of hormonal transition. But trans women deserve orgasms too so I set out to find them. View this image  Kaye Blegvad for BuzzFeed News The erotic is a resource within each of us that lies in a deeply female and spiritual plane, firmly rooted in the power of our unexpressed or unrecognized feeling. In order to perpetuate itself, every oppression must corrupt or distort those various sources of power within the culture of the oppressed that can provide energy for change. For women, this has meant a suppression of the erotic as a considered source of power and information within our lives. Audre Lorde, The Uses of the Erotic A couple years ago, when I finally took the steps to start hormone replacement therapy in order to feminize my body, I found a pamphlet on the internet about the effects of ingesting testosterone blockers and estrogen. In a nutshell, they included redistribution of fat, breast tissue development, decrease in muscle mass and body hair, decrease in sex drive and sexual function, decrease or loss of erectile function, decreased ability to make sperm and ejaculatory fluid, and sterility. There were a lot of things I didnt like about my body at the time (and to this day), but my sex drive wasnt one of them. And while I wanted needed to start hormones, I was scared of losing my ability to feel sexual pleasure. So the next time I had an appointment with my doctor to talk about hormones, I asked her if I would still be able to have orgasms. She made a disgusted sound from the back of her throat, as though Id just said something distasteful and completely inappropriate. Most transsexuals find, she said, refusing to meet my gaze, that their masculine sexualurges are very disturbing to them. So that when they become women, they dont need orgasms. It wasnt until after I went home, feeling humiliated and crushed, that I really began to think about the implication of what shed said: When they become women, they dont need orgasms. What the hell did that mean? That I had to choose between my sexuality and my gender identity as a woman? That trans women arent supposed to have a sexuality? One would hope that trans-friendly, trans-knowledgeable medical professionals would help transitioning patients through hormone- and surgery-related changes in libido and orgasmic experience. But the truth is, most doctors and health care providers have little to no education in this area even trans health specialists. As a clinical social worker, Ive worked on several medical teams specializing in gender transition and trans mental and sexual health, and none of the doctors there could answer my questions much better than my personal physician. A scan of medical literature on trans sexuality brings up similar (meager) results: The few papers that exist are hopelessly outdated, use a very narrow definition of sexual intercourse, and usually end by concluding that there is a massive lack of knowledge about trans womens sexual satisfaction in the medical community. Yet the information exists within the trans women community itself: time-tested information gathered by kinksters, sex workers, writers, and zinesters like Mira Bellwether, author of the underground-famous zine Fucking Trans Women. They agree: Medical transition, whether hormonal or surgical, doesnt make either sexual pleasure or orgasm impossible. Rather, the way in which orgasm can be achieved and experienced changes. Each trans woman like every woman is unique. For young trans girls of color growing up and just trying to survive a world that marks us for rape and violence from the moment we show who we really are, finding accurate and helpful sexual information about our own bodies can be all but impossible. Trans girls learn early on that the realm of our sexuality is a difficult, painful, even dangerous place. But there is also beauty there, and power, and pleasure if you know where to look. It wasnt until I finally started to ask other trans women about their stories of sexuality and self-discovery that I was able to find what I was looking for. A note to trans women in search of answers: Your sisters are the answer. They are always the answer. Growing up and absorbing all of the mainstream social stereotypes about trans women, I learned to think of my body as disgusting and wrong, and my own sexual urges as something dirty. If anyone wanted me, I believed, it could only be for a fetish, something deviant and sick. So when I started hormone replacement therapy and my libido did diminish somewhat, I experienced this as a relief, at first. Without the pangs of erotic desire, I didnt have to think as much about all of the shame I felt around my sexuality. But the more time passed, the more I started to miss my eroticism the more I began to wonder if the physical transformation that was happening to me had to mean the end of my sexual life. I began to feel angry that, for me and so many of my trans feminine friends, sex was this source of unending pain, when for others, it was a source of joy. Being the incorrigible geek that I am, I decided to do some research. It turned out that a lot of other trans women I knew who were just starting or considering starting hormone replacement therapy had the same worries and questions as me. And just like me, none of them had heard anything useful from their doctors or health care workers about it. Even more disturbingly, some had gotten the message from their doctors and psychologists that they really werent supposed to desire sexuality or sexual pleasure. This would mean, they were told, that they werent really transsexual. This idea comes from an outdated psychological theory, developed by (white, cisgender male) psychologist Ray Blanchard in the 1980s, that there two kinds of trans women: true transsexuals and fake transsexuals. According to this theory, fake transsexuals, or autogynephiles, are really men who fetishize the idea of playing a female role, wearing female clothing, or having a female body. This philosophy posits that both kinds of transsexuals are afflicted by mental illness. While current psychological and sociological literature has thoroughly refuted this idea with transsexualism having been removed from the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders many misguided health professionals and members of the public remain deeply influenced by it. What I find both disturbing and intriguing about so-called autogynephiles is that, according to Blanchard, true trans women wouldnt be disturbed by lacking a sex drive or sexual pleasure which seems to imply that real women shouldnt have or desire sexuality. This, to me, is the place where transphobia and misogyny meet, where the repression and rejection of trans womens sexuality speaks to the rejection of all womens sexuality. The punishing idea that in order to become real women, trans women should give up their erotic potential comes from the same place that the orgasm gap between men and women does: the hatred of the concept that women any women could and should actually enjoy having sex. There is a nearly impenetrable layer of glamour and mystery that surrounds the question of trans womens sexuality: How do we fuck? Whom do we fuck? Who wants to fuck us? What do our genitals look like, and how do they work? Do we orgasm? How? Are we straight/gay/bisexual/lesbian? Does fucking us make you gay/straight/bisexual/lesbian? Were like the Bermuda Triangle of sexuality: Weve got a rep for being freaky and possibly dangerous. People go in, but they dont come out. And you better believe that none of this stuff is ever, ever covered in middle or high school sex ed. As my friend Lily, a trans femme social psychology student and writer at Stanford University, tells me: Making the sex ed I learned relevant to me after coming out as trans felt like reinventing the wheel I had to take what I knew about my body and what I knew about sex/pregnancy/biology/STIs/health/the medical industry/etc. and make all the necessary connections myself. Sure, theres a whole lot of chick with a dick and she-male porn out there if you know where to look, but what you have to understand is that very, very little of that is really about trans womens sexuality. Its a fantasy, meant to cater to cisgender men. Our pleasure, our desires, our selves have nothing to do with it. And that makes me angry. It pisses me off. Because where does that leave us trans women? Where does that leave the people who love us and want to have sex with us? (And yes, there are quite a few, thank you very much.) What does it mean for young trans girls, just discovering themselves or old trans girls, just discovering themselves if the only way that society ever talks about us as sexual beings is with confusion and sensationalism, topped off with a healthy serving of disgust? If the only erotic images of ourselves available to us is pornography thats all about using our bodies as a kind of sex toy for cis men? How do we learn to be loved and make love (or, at least, how to get it on) for our own pleasure? Trans women deserve pleasure just as much as anybody else. So whats a trans woman who wants to get down and dirty with her partners (or herself) to do? It doesnt make matters any easier that trans people are at heightened risk for experiences of sexual violence some studies place our likelihood of being sexually assaulted at some point in our lifetimes at 50% which can make any kind of sexual contact terrifying on a psychological level. (As a survivor of multiple sexual assaults in adolescence and young adulthood, I can attest to this no matter how many years pass, no matter how many wonderful and consensual sex partners I meet, I can still remember the sensation of bone-crunching fear, of flying up and out of my body into a place beyond terror, as fresh as if the attack were happening now.) And yet, there are trans women whole communities of them who not only enjoy sex, but take their eroticism to entirely new places, far beyond the mainstream assumptions and stereotypes about what sexuality is supposed to be. It was only in the process of doing research for this article that I discovered the secret of trans womancentered sexuality. Somehow, in all my time writing about and doing activism with trans women, I had missed it: a whole world full of new ways to fuck, get fucked, and pour sweet, sweet loving all over myself. It began with a conversation in my kitchen with my friend Estelle, a community support worker and glamorous trans lady-about-town. Over a home-cooked meal of sauted prawns and coconut rice, she graciously let me in on her perspective on trans womens sexuality. All that stuff about trans women not being sexual is totally not true, she said. I think we need to start thinking about trans womens bodies differently. Like, just because some trans women cant get an erection or whatever doesnt mean anything. For one thing, flaccid penises can be totally erotic. For another, we need to stop thinking about sex in terms of cis mens orgasms. Yes, girl. Yes. Estelle also told me about muffing a kind of sexual penetration popular in some circles of trans women that I had never heard about before. Basically, muffing is the act of using the inguinal canals the two canals just above the scrotum, on either side of the pubic bone, from which testicles originally descend or drop to achieve penetration with fingers, a sex toy, or a penis. Because there are a lot of nerve endings in that region of the body, muffing can allow enormous amounts of sexual pleasure. (I suggest that the curious experiment with muffing gently and slowly at first, perhaps consulting this beautiful online zine created by trans artist and writer merritt kopas.) Mind-blowing, isnt it? How many people are even aware that the human body is capable of such a thing? Or perhaps a better question is why arent more of us aware of it? Why does our society keep us totally in the dark about all of the vast multiplicity of ways that pleasure and intimacy are possible? Once I got started, I couldnt stop: I fell down the rabbit hole of researching all the incredible ways that trans women practice sex and masturbation. Believe me, there is a lot thats possible. To give but a few examples: Theres rooing, or stimulating the base of the penis, just behind the scrotum, above the perineum. The skin of the scrotum can be inverted in order to penetrate a cavity called the deep perineal pouch. Much like with muffing, the density of nerve endings in this part of the body can lead to sexual stimulation and, yes, orgasm. Theres telescoping, which is used to stimulate a non-erect penis (this can be particularly enjoyable for trans women who like getting off, but find erections triggering or unpleasant). The penis is sort of pushed back into the scrotum, which is then folded back into the pubis to resemble a labia and clitoris, which can then be stroked or penetrated. In general, the glans of the penis can be stimulated in all kinds of ways, whether or not the penis itself is erect: stroking, licking, and using a vibrator, for example. And then, of course, there are the nipples, breasts, and anus As I read on, and on, and on about all the kinds of sex I wasnt yet having, I couldnt stop thinking: I cant believe I didnt know. After talking to Lily, Estelle, and other trans women whom I love and admire deeply, I began to get more and more curious about what my new body might be capable of. So one night, I locked myself in the shower and took a long, hot soak. Then I wrapped myself in my biggest, softest towels and went to lie down in my bedroom. There, I started to explore myself. With nervous hands, I tried to locate my inguinal canals. It took a lot of searching, and I felt first frustrated, then disappointed, then angry. Angry at the world. Angry at myself. Angry at I dont know. But then, my finger slid into a hollow cavity that I hadnt known was there before. I found one on the opposite side. I pushed, gently at first, and then harder. My fingers slipped inside, up to the first knuckle. A breath I didnt know I was holding rushed out of my lungs in a long, single burst. And unexpectedly, inexplicably, I began to cry. A few tears at first, and then huge, gut-wrenching sobs that seemed to come from some hidden place deep inside my body where all of that fear and self-hatred and longing had been hiding as though my questing, nervous fingers had turned a secret lock and all of the tears could finally come pouring out. When it comes to the mystery of trans womens sexuality, heres what Ive learned: We fuck in all kinds of ways, some of which you may have to look up on the internet. We fuck all kinds of people, for all kinds of reasons. Fucking us doesnt necessarily make you gay/straight/lesbian/bisexual, and it doesnt make you a fetishist either. It may make you nervous, sad, embarrassed, ashamed, terrified, anticipatory, curious, delighted, wondrous, awestruck. It definitely makes you human. Just like us. Then, of course, there are the orgasms: apparently not so impossible to achieve after all. While sex certainly doesnt need to focus on orgasm as the be-all and end-all goal, many trans women (like yours truly) are certainly interested in having them in one way or another. And the thing is we deserve orgasms. Hormonal and postsurgical side effects shouldnt change that. For one thing, some trans women dont want or need hormones or surgery. Those who do should have access to accurate, sex-positive information about how to adjust to how to love our changing bodies. Because transitioning should be about loving ones body: loving it in the sense of seeing ourselves as beautiful and pleasurable, and also in the sense of making love. We deserve to know how to give ourselves orgasms, and how to teach others to give us orgasms. There are many kinds of loving, and we deserve them all.

aS"Who knew thered be so much confusion? View this image  View on Instagram Thats me on the left and the hubby on the right as we completed our marriage application, thus beginning the lengthy process of changing my last name. I thought a lot about the decision to become a Jedeikin (my husbands surname) before my wedding day, but honestly didnt realize what a gigantic pain doing so would become. Its a lengthy process, and, in hindsight, I realize that I should have probably done a little more research before walking down the aisle. View this image  Before we go any further, Ill address the elephant in the room: Im a dude, who married another dude, and changed my last name. I recognize that isnt a very common thing. Heck, when I met my now-husband, marriage equality wasnt yet law of the land. Im mentioning this now because I honestly had no idea that I was going to need to physically visit both the DMV and Social Security office in order to legally change my name. I had this vision that everything would magically just get updated, which was 100% incorrect. Maybe its because, unlike women who grow up in more traditional environments, guys arent typically raised with the expectation that we might change our last name someday. Or maybe Im just a total dumbass! Either way, I probably should have Googled changing your last name before my wedding day, because I didnt expect that I would need to take multiple mornings off work to hit up my local government agencies. View this image  Youll need to visit some places (like banks) in person, others will make the change over the phone, and many will want you to fax or mail copies of your marriage certificate and sometimes your new identification. What surprised me was just how many companies I had to contact. Like, the list was huge. Imagine every single account and profile youve accumulated in your life needing to be changed. Its a pain! View this image  Having to tell dozens of strangers that you recently got married is an awkward introverts worst nightmare. A few times, I tried to lead without the marriage part, but Id always get asked why I made the change? So I would again have to drop the I got married bomb. Not only did I feel weird repeating the line I got married, but when I mentioned now having my husbands last name I was essentially outing myself as a gay man to people I didnt know, which was uncomfortable. I mean, Im a proud member of the LGBT community, but having to announce my gayness to strangers did cause extra anxiety. View this image  I had to make multiple trips to the bank because they used the wrong forms, my credit card company sent me multiple copies of the same card, and even agents at government agencies werent always helpful. For example, when I went to the Social Security office, I asked the person helping me if I would need to wait until my new Social Security card arrived before going to the DMV and he told me, You know, thats a good question. Ive been asked it before, but I have no idea. View on Instagram When someone asked why I changed my name, I couldnt help but think, Well fuck, how awkward would this be if I ever did need to change my name back to Guiver? I dont know if its a common newlywed thing or just me, but I generally dont even like thinking about the D word. My husband and I are grown adults, though, and we do have a prenuptial agreement, so the topic has been broached before. But having these thoughts scared me, and reminded me that I really do want my marriage to last a long time. Because yeah, having to change my name back would suck. Mathew Jedeikin I had to delete and re-create my Snapchat account, which does sound trivial, but I was bummed that I lost the few followers I actually had on Snapchat as a result of changing my name. Then I had to email or text my friends, asking them to accept my friend request so that we could get back to snapping. View on Instagram You need an ID that matches your name to do a lot of things, like flying on an airplane or boarding a cruise ship. So, to make things simpler, I booked my honeymoon with my old last name. Which wasnt terrible, but boy, how I wished I could have gone on my honeymoon as a Jedeikin. Also, I basically had to carry around two forms of identification for a month and a half (as well as a copy of my marriage license) in case I needed to use a credit card or access an account that hadnt been updated. Fortunately, I had the option to hold off on updating my passport, which functioned as my Guiver identification. View this image  On multiple occasions, when I would say that I changed my name, people would ask David how he convinced me to do it. That joke always seemed so weird to me, because it was my idea to change my name. I have a family middle name that I wanted to pass on to our future child, and I also wanted our household to share a last name. So it made sense for me to change my last name. In fact, David encouraged me to think carefully about my decision and didnt pressure me one way or the other. View this image  $27 fee at the DMV, $16 for a new passport photo, then $110 for the passport. All in all, the new name cost me $153. View this image  People who knew you by your old last name will forget. Colleagues and work contacts will be confused when you email them from a new email addy. Recently a friend came to visit me when I was working out of our L.A. office and he forgot that I had changed my last name. So he told the security guards he was there to see Mathew Guiver, and they had no idea who that was. Luckily, I was sitting close to the front door, but a new name is definitely something that takes people who know you a little time to get used to. View this image  During a somewhat heated discussion with David, I momentarily thought about saying something to the effect of Well, I changed my name for you. As if I should be able to win the argument because of the decision I made to change my name. Thankfully I caught myself and didnt say it. I did, however, remind myself that this was totally my decision and that I shouldnt expect special treatment because of my new last name. Mathew Jedeikin Mathew Jedeikin Whenever I feel like Im done, another place where I need to change my name comes up. College and high school records, voter registration, frequent flyer travel accounts. Somehow, I actually still have more things to change. View on Instagram Its a weird feeling thats hard to explain, but I almost feel like I was given a fresh start. Not only as a married person, but like, Ive been able to leave behind parts of Mathew Guiver that I no longer need, and I get to be selective about who I am as Mathew Jedeikin. From small things like how I sign my new name (or a new passport photo that I actually like!), to larger things like how I present myself to the world as a Jedeikin. Its been stressful and complicated, yes, but I definitely dont regret the decision to change my name. I do, however, wish Id been a little more informed before my wedding day, but you know what they say: Hindsight is always 20/20! Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .

View on Instagram Im a fan of all these publications and the 100s of others that have used bizarre click bait headlines and taken a really light hearted funny interview with @galore out of context But I literally dont hate anything I dont think airport fashion is trash Nor do I think I turned anyone anything I just answered the questions asked Just read the link from Galore Ill put in my bio. I said everything is a blessing, everything is complimentary and I dont take it seriously. Also that I found Channing Tatum really hot in magic mike but sadly I didnt turn straight. .. I also named basically all my friends who are perfect looking all the time and said Im trash at the airport and they are heaven. So I dont know why people cant just use actual quotes from the article.. Why make a positive article a negative jab.  I think everyone is somewhere on the Kinsey scale.. So to make headlines ( most people dont bother reading the rest ) appear like Im shaming people about their sexuality or like I have any right to claim to know others sexuality is dangerous.

aS"A Dallas case of Zika was transmitted by anal sex between an infected man and his male partner, federal health officials reported on Thursday. View this image  Photo Credit: Cynthia Goldsmith / CDC On Thursday, federal health officials reported the first case of Zika transmitted through anal sex: a Dallas man who infected his male partner after a trip to Venezuela. Both vaginal and anal sex is an emerging mode of Zika virus infection that might contribute to more illness than was anticipated, said U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers in their report. The CDC has suggested that both straight and LGBT couples use condoms after traveling to regions afflicted by Zika, which now includes 33 nations in the Americas. In the current outbreak of the virus, marked by an alarming increase in severe brain birth defects in Brazil, there have been at least six confirmed sexually transmitted cases, including the Dallas one. In January, one of the men had returned from a trip to Venezuela, where an outbreak is now ongoing. He had anal sex with his long-time partner without a condom one day before and one day after developing symptoms of Zika a purple rash and fever. His partner developed Zika symptoms seven days later, confirmed by lab tests. I was, in fact, expecting the first report to come out about this scenario soon, infectious disease expert Brian Foy of Colorado State University told BuzzFeed News by email. This is not surprising to me at all. In 2011, Foy reported that he had infected his own wife with Zika after returning from a trip to Africa infected with the virus, in the first scientific report of its sexual transmission. If virus is in the semen, anyway it gets into the body of the sexual partner vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse perhaps even via oral sex it has the chance, or is likely, to foster an infection of that sexual partner. Only the semen of the man who had been to Venezuela showed some signs of containing Zika virus within three weeks of his return. It did not appear in either mans saliva or urine. The men had been monogamous for 10 years and had none of the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in their home that more typically carry the virus. Although Zika can be spread sexually, mosquitoes still represent the biggest risk, Peter Hotez of the Baylor College of Medicine told BuzzFeed News. At this point, around the time of acute illness there is a small risk of sexual transmission. Notably, all men in the case reports and semen studies experienced symptoms of Zika, which may only appear in 1 in 5 infections. The pressing public health question in sexual transmission of Zika is exactly how long the virus can live in semen, mosquito-borne virus expert Nikolaos Vasilakis of the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston told BuzzFeed News. In March, the CDC called for men with pregnant partners who have traveled to Zika-afflicted regions to continue using condoms for the entire duration of a pregnancy, out of an abundance of caution. 3.

aS"Critics say it targets LGBT clients, but unlike another recusal measure that has drawn protest in Mississippi, the bill has received only moderate attention. View this image  \\ AP / Erik Schelzig Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam signed a bill into law on Wednesday allowing counselors and therapists to refuse clients based on their beliefs seen by several advocacy groups as part of a national legislative effort to enact laws that let service providers reject LGBT people. Proponents of the law had argued it was necessary to ensure clients would get help from providers best suited for their needs instead of getting stuck with professionals who are a bad fit. In a statement, Haslam said, I believe it is reasonable to allow these professionals to determine if and when an individual would be better served by another counselor better suited to meet his or her needs. The substance of this bill doesnt address a group, issue or belief system, he added. Rather, it allows counselors just as we allow other professionals like doctors and lawyers to refer a client to another counselor when the goals or behaviors would violate a sincerely held principle. After the Tennessee legislature passed the bill earlier this month, LGBT groups pressured Haslam to block it. However, their efforts were minimal compared to the crush of corporate lobbying faced by governors of Mississippi and Georgia, where legislatures this year passed broad religious freedom bills that critics said allowed services and products to be denied to LGBT people. Georgias governor ultimately acceded and vetoed the bill Mississippis governor did not, and is now in the bulls eye of protests. The comparatively moderate outcry over Tennessees bill appeared to result from its narrower scope. House Bill 1840, also known as Senate Bill 1556, provides counselors and therapists immunity from liability if they turn away a client whose goals, outcomes, or behaviors conflict with their beliefs. It was originally introduced to protect sincerely held religious beliefs, but lawmakers widened it slightly. As passed, it would instead protect counselors acting on sincerely held principles. Counselors who decline clients would need to refer them to a provider who will see them, and it does not apply to clients in risk of imminent danger. Haslam said those exemptions addressed concerns I had about clients not receiving care. Although sweeping recusal bills have drawn national outcry the past couple years, other narrowly tailored bills which protect one group or industry have seen less resistance. Take Kansas, which passed a bill in March to protect religious student groups that exclude certain members, which critics said was designed to let Christian school groups ban LGBT students. Gov. Sam Brownback signed it. Although piecemeal bills like the one in Kansas may not garner the same type of national backlash we see in North Carolina, Georgia, and elsewhere, every single one of them impacts LGBT Americans in communities across the country, Dan Rafter, a spokesman for LGBT advocacy group Freedom For All Americans, told BuzzFeed News. Another example is Michigan, where the legislature passed a bill last year to let publicly funded adoption agencies turn away parents on religious grounds. It was similarly regarded as means to let certain providers particularly Catholic charities shut out same-sex parents. Gov. Rick Snyder signed it into law. But Snyder had a different reaction to a more general religious freedom bill: He announced earlier the same year that if the legislature passed the bill, he would veto it. While they may not all generate the tsunami of bad press, Rafter said of the recusal bills with a narrower breadth, they all chip away at a states reputation. Businesses have started to take note of these types of smaller bills and its only a matter of time until they start speaking out in greater force. In Tennessee, Gov. Haslam has spoken up about a different bill opposed by LGBT advocates a measure to ban transgender students from school restrooms that match their gender identity. Haslam said it could jeopardize access to federal education funds. But while Haslam had taken a position on that measure which is currently frozen in a Senate committee he kept his card close to his chest on the counselor bill. The governor is deferred to the will of the legislature on this bill as amended, spokesperson Jennifer Donnals told BuzzFeed News. She declined to explain what the sentence meant. She continued, As with every piece of legislation that comes to him, he will review it in its final form before taking any action. Halslam did not face the same pressure over HB 1840 as governors in states with broader recusal bills, but he encountered some pushback. The American Counseling Association has said the bill conflicts with a code of ethics and targets LGBT people. An online petition asked Haslam to veto the bill because it would make it harder for LGBTQ people to get mental health care. Meanwhile, the Family Action Council of Tennessee, a group that opposes LGBT-protection laws, advocated for the bill though the group said it is not designed to target LGBT people.

aS"I felt so badass. View this image  When it comes to Hollywood, the lack of diversity in TV and film leads is well documented. A 2015 USC analysis found, unsurprisingly, that the average popular film lead is white and male. Hes almost guaranteed to be straight, too. Although the number of gay and transgender characters on TV has increased in the past few years, we still see a statistical absence of LGBT characters from prominent movie roles. But what if we not only write more roles for gay characters, but put their images and storylines front and center? Seeing relatable characters can help a child, or anyone for that matter, become more comfortable with themselves. So we gathered a group of LGBT people, chose a few of our favorite movie posters, and had a blast re-creating them. View this image  Macey Foronda and Charlotte Gomez for BuzzFeed Warner Bros. Pictures Kennen: Movies with gay characters are always the sassy gay friend, sexually aggressive bisexuals and lesbians, or one partner dies tragically. There was never a Superman who was an amazing hero that just happens to be gay. So having something like this makes the young gay kid in me very proud and happy to be gay! I didnt really come out until my early twenties. I do think that if there were more posters and movies depicting LGBTQ people, I wouldve probably come to terms with my sexuality way earlier and skipped the whole self-punishment phase. View this image  Nicola: If you look at arguably the biggest movie about a gay couple, Brokeback Mountain, in the poster, theyre not even in the same shot, let alone showing affection. [When I was growing up] 100% of movie posters with couples were straight couples, and even if there was a gay character, youd never see them showing affection on a poster. Often were seen as just the funny person, or other one-dimensional tropes, so seeing a romantic relationship, I think, gives a lot of young LGBT people hope. View this image  Macey Foronda and Charlotte Gomez for BuzzFeed Warner Bros. Pictures Wyatt: I grew up in a very diverse and multicultural community, and I would love to see that reflected in posters. People get used to seeing monochromatic posters and subconsciously accept them as the norm. View this image  As a trans man of color [who] has had the opportunity to transition physically and the privilege of being an actor, I feel that it is my responsibility to represent guys like me whenever I can. I would like to show others who dont know much about the LGBT community that we come in a lot of different styles, shapes, and colors! View this image  View this image  Macey Foronda and Charlotte Gomez for BuzzFeed 20th Century Fox Stephanie: Movie posters were a huge part of my childhood. I feel like no matter what age someone is, movies are a huge escape or hope for us, and not seeing many LGBT people represented made me feel a bit more alone and isolated during my coming-out process. View this image  Taylor: [In the past] I just mindlessly looked at movie posters, and honestly never paid much attention to them. But once I went to college and became more aware of films and their imagery, I paid more attention and became pissed off at the lack of LGBT representation. I think LGBT people are so underrepresented, and movie posters are no exception. As a kid I wish I had had somewhere to turn in media to see gay people like me, especially on an open platform like [BuzzFeed], so to me this is very important. View this image  View this image  Macey Foronda and Charlotte Gomez for BuzzFeed Paramount Pictures Nick: I honestly never really saw many people of color in movie posters, and definitely never really saw gay people. So it was kinda weird not really being able to relate to movies as a kid. I was just like, OK, Ill watch TV, I guess. Clueless was one of my favorite movies from back in the day, though, so I really wanted to do a good job becoming Dionne! Curly: I think its important to see all types of people in movie posters white, black, asian, gay, straight, lesbians, ALL OF THE ABOVE because everyone should be represented. View this image  Mathew: There are so many movies that are iconic to many of us in the LGBT community (like Clueless or Mean Girls), and although those movies each had important gay characters (Christian and Damian), they were both missing from the posters! The stereotypical gay characters are literally hidden in the background! Growing up and seeing these characters you relate to practically invisible in all of a movies marketing materials can make you feel sort of invisible. So it made me happy to be able to participate in this project, to take one of my favorite movies and put characters prominently in the poster. View this image  Macey Foronda and Charlotte Gomez for BuzzFeed Paramount Pictures R.J.: A lot of people will see these posters and think of them as funny. And to those people, I just want to ask them why? I mean, sure, were spoofing movie posters, but is that the only reason why we laugh? Could it be that we think its unusual for LGBT people to be portrayed in such a heteronormative light? Theres nothing inherently different about LGBT people other than how they choose to express their sexuality. So then why do we insist that they only be portrayed in such a limited capacity? View this image  Will: I [want] to show through example that Im not ashamed of who I am. Hopefully, someone else will be inspired to not be ashamed of who they are. View this image  View this image  View this image  Kennan: Im really happy about how [the posters] turned out! We need more LGBTQ characters that young audiences can emulate and identify with. By doing [these posters], I think it will help lift the stigma of what it means to be LGBTQ! R.J.: I was pretty blown away by how spot-on we were able to get the photograph. Our proportions are a tad different than Patrick and Demis, but we definitely made it work. I think people will get a kick out of it for sure! Wyatt: This was such a fantastic experience, and I am excited to keep pushing the limits of what many expect guys like me to be like. And to better demonstrate who we are. LGBT people have a multitude of talents and have been contributing members of society since the dawn of time. We have been around and will continue to defy odds. View this image  Stephanie: Im very proud about the finished product, and I hope that the world can recognize that and realize we do need more representation for this community. Mathew: I love how all of the posters came out. Seeing this beautiful and diverse group of people confidently taking on these posters warmed my often cold heart, and getting to meet and work with everyone was such a powerful experience. Weve made great progress in this country when it comes to LGBT rights, but there are still places where we arent viewed as equals. Its scary to think that people in states like Mississippi want to refuse us service or deny us the ability to adopt children just because of who we are. I know the representation of LGBT people in the media has improved, but theres still work to be done. I hope that one day these laws will be a way of the past, and that when I take my child to see a movie shell be able to look around the theater and see posters filled with characters that shell be able to relate to.

For my career as a childrens book author, these school visits are not only a fun and inspiring way to connect directly with my readers, theyre an essential supplement to my income. Childrens book writers tend to garner about half the real dollar-per-book royalties as their adult writer counterparts (because of lower rates and lower price points on the books). In order to keep writing, I spend about a third of my time on the road presenting to school kids. Ive never had a New York Times best-seller or a movie deal. School visits make it possible to pay my bills. Luckily, school visits are also one of the most fun parts of the job. There is nothing like the moment when a child connects with a book that feels like it was written just for them and then realizes the author is a flesh-and-blood person, ready to offer encouragement, answer their questions, and make them laugh. The realization usually sparks all kinds of curiosity about the life of that flesh-and-blood person and there is always no matter the school, no matter the region a child who raises her hand and asks me, with an absolute un-self-conscious need-to-know, Are you married? The easy answer, in the beginning, wouldve been a simple no. Well, not a simple no, but a true one. I wasnt married. But I wasnt married only because same-sex marriage wasnt legal. I wasnt married because the love of my life was another man. The first time I was asked was at an elementary school in Houston. Im not sure how long I paused after the question, standing silent in front of my PowerPoint staring at the gap-toothed child whod asked me. I remember the thoughts that passed through my head at that moment, because they passed through my head again and again in visit after visit over the years. What happens if I tell the truth about why Im not married? What happens if I reveal this part of myself? Does my career in childrens books end? Will teachers and parents look at me askance? Ban my books? Run me out of town as some kind of creep trying to recruit or pushing a gay agenda? Will I never be invited to another school again? View this image  Andrew Richard / BuzzFeed Already in our culture, men who work with young children are looked at with suspicion. Gay men perhaps doubly so. Anita Bryants 1978 campaign to ban LGBT people from teaching is not yet ancient history. So I played the little girls question off with a joke, something like, Why? Are you proposing to me? Im a little old for you! The other kids laughed; the girl blushed and laughed, and I moved on to the next question about my favorite video game. That became my go-to deflection every time, and as the laughter subsided, Id always be on to answering how I got the idea for one character or another, or how I handle writers block, and Id hear no more about my marital status and the kids would quickly forget that I hadnt actually answered that question at all. My dodge always worked, but I dreaded being asked every time and I always regretted dodging the question afterward. My boyfriend and I might as well have been married. Wed lived together for years, shared furniture and a dog I even showed kids pictures of the dog in my PowerPoint! and we had big plans for our future. We would get married once the law allowed us to. It wasnt that complicated and a 10-year-old could certainly have understood it, but still I made it a joke and I moved on. Did I really want to come out in front of hundreds of fifth-graders? I did not. At every elementary and every middle school, in every presentation, for three to four presentations a day, I deflected in a way I hadnt since I was in high school and stayed in the closet. I told myself this wasnt really a return to the closet. I was just keeping my gay identity and my work completely separate, as if being a novelist were like being an electrician. Who cares if your electrician brings his full and honest self to the rewiring of a breaker box? But being a novelist isnt the same. In my books I carry my young readers through huge ranges of experience and emotion, adventure and danger, hope and loss, fear and bravery, giggles and tears. When I talk in schools about my process, I share the real-life inspiration behind the ideas in my books and I talk about honesty and clarity in storytelling. Yet I always kept this one thing walled off. It was my right to do so writers do not owe their readers personal revelations but still, it felt dishonest. And then, shortly after same-sex marriage became legal around the country and my boyfriend became my husband, I was at an elementary school in New Jersey. The question came up: Are you married? I was wearing my wedding ring. Id been married for a month. I was really excited about it. So I said, Yes, I am. What does your wife do for a job? the girl asked. Well, I have a husband, not a wife, and hes a teacher. One or two of the boys looked at each other puzzled and then not puzzled. A girl giggled and another girl elbowed her in the side. And that was it. Id just come out to a room full of kids and they didnt really care. The next question was about whether I would ever write another military action book (Id written six by then; they came with dog tags). I said I would and the boy whod asked high-fived the boy next to him because they really liked my military action books. After the talk, I signed books. Everyone was really excited to get a book signed by a real author. Kids wanted to know what breed my dog was and which football team I liked. Some of the boys told me I should be ashamed of myselffor liking the New York Jets. They werent wrong. From that day on, I always answered The Question when it was asked. Once in a while, a teacher would look up from grading papers in the back of the room with a quizzical expression, but that was the extent of it. In middle schools, there would be a louder gasp or two from the students, or a whispered Whatd he say? from neighbor to neighbor. Sometimes, in those audiences, eyes would light up, tiny smiles creeping at the edges of a 13-year-olds mouth. A nearly invisible nod. Sometimes my solutions to writers block got bigger reactions. Month after month, year after year, I kept telling them about my husband. I didnt have an agenda. I was just answering their questions honestly as they came up, the same way I answered their other questions about plot ideas or thinking of book titles or how to get published. In many cases, I was the first out adult these kids had ever met. In Norman, Oklahoma, a little boy waited until after the presentation to talk to me. With nervous glances at the other kids still standing around us, he told me that he was gay and that he was happy to see how confident I was, how it made him feel like he could be confident. Like I could have a good future too, he said. After a school talk in Connecticut, I got a note from a seventh-grade girl who told me shed come out a few weeks before my visit, and kids who hadnt spoken to her since then were talking to her again. It wasnt that you inspired me, she explained. It was that you inspired my straight friends to see me as more than just a queer kid. In Charleston, South Carolina, a sixth-grade boy got two books signed, one for himself and one for his friend whod just told him he was gay. He thought his friend would think it was cool that hed gotten his book signed by a famous author, who was just like him. Except for being a Jets fan, he added. Every one of these kids was braver than I had been when I was their age and their revelations did not come without risk within their communities, within their own families. While I was never chased from a school after coming out during a Q&A, I have gotten letters from parents and seen book reviews online, enraged that I would foist my agenda into childrens books, angered that I would presume to introduce children to such a controversial subject. View this image  Andrew Richard / BuzzFeed But I dont think the existence of that boy in Norman, Oklahoma, or Charleston, South Carolina, or the girl in Connecticut is controversial at all. I dont think my existence is controversial. I decided to take a cue from the brave kids Id met and show a little more bravery in my own career. For my newest book, I changed my author bio on the back flap to read: C. Alexander London is the author of the middle- grade series The Accidental Adventures, Dog Tags, and Tides of War, and of the young-adult novels Proxy and Guardian. His most recent novel is The Wild Ones. A former journalist and childrens librarian, he is now a full-time writer. He lives with his husband and dog in Brooklyn, New York. I figured including my husband would save time during the Q&A, so I could focus more on the reading and writing questions that were the reason schools bring me to speak anyway. I have a lot more to say to kids about reading and writing than I do about being married, except that its helpful for a writer to be married to a teacher. They make excellent proofreaders. Being out in childrens literature is not uncommon now. There are a wide array of LGBTQIA authors living and speaking and writing openly for upper-elementary students, from the heart-warming story of a transgender child in Alexs Ginos George to Brian Selznicks The Marvels, which explores art, and family, and history, and AIDS; and authors like Jacqueline Woodson, writing powerful verse memoirs; or Tim Federles musical theater romp in Better Nate Than Ever. Phil Bildner publishes beloved and diverse books set around basketball and baseball. Im writing about a talking raccoons adventures. Our stories are as unlimited as our selves. But there are limited school budgets, and there are plenty of great speakers and writers who dont spark controversy. As the old librarians saying goes, Its not censorship; its selection. I dont know if the choice to come out on my book jacket has cost me school-visit invitations. I dont hear from the librarians who choose not to invite an author whose identity might be controversial. I dont meet the kids whose schools dont come calling. I was signing books at an elementary school in Minnesota last fall and a young girl waiting in line to get her book signed flipped to the back and read my bio. Oh, she said. Im glad I got my book before my dad saw this. I really want to read it I love raccoons but he doesnt approve of gay people. To her, my hero mattered far more than my husband. I signed her book with a drawing of a raccoon, like I always did, and for a moment I wondered if Id made a mistake, cost myself an unknown number of readers just by my back-flap biography. Kids no matter how open-minded and inclusive they are are not the ones buying their own books. If I alienate their parents, my ability to make a living withers. But being out on the bookshelf between Jack London and Lois Lowry still makes an impact. Being open with young people creates opportunities for their world to grow a little bit. I recently had a fifth-grader at an international school urgently warn me of a typo on the back flap. It says you have a husband! he announced. I was about to explain that I do indeed have husband, when another fifth-grader cut him off. He does, she said. Hes gay, another boy added with a shrug. Theres no problem with that. No, I dont have a problem with that, the first boy explained himself. I just thought it was a mistake. He handed me his book to get signed. It wasnt a mistake, I confirmed as I signed his book, but he already had another concern, and it made his forehead wrinkle in worry. Will you draw a raccoon in my book too? he asked. But, like, make it really big? And I did, grateful that a new generation of readers have their priorities straight. *** C.

aS"He was left with 15 stitches in his head. View this image  Isaac Keatinge Isaac Keatinge, who identifies as queer, told BuzzFeed News he was walking towards King Street in Newtown at around midnight when three men started to insult him with anti-gay and anti-transgender slurs. They verbally assaulted me, comments about wearing a dress. I responded in kind, he said. I wasnt afraid of going up to them to talk and try to diffuse the situation. But the punches came as soon as I went up to them. It was so rapid. Left with injuries and extremely disoriented, Keatinge managed to stumble back towards the party, where his friends found him and took him to the emergency department at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. He received 15 stitches for a laceration to his head, along with multiple bruises and a heavily swollen eye. NSW Police said they were investigating whether the attack was motivated by bias based on [Keatinges] appearance at the time. This report is extremely concerning and absolutely unacceptable. NSW Police will follow every avenue of investigation possible, said Superintendent Simon Hardman in a statement. View this image  Isaac Keatinge Ive been confronted by people so many times before, he said. I said to friends, its not the first time, just the worst time. My brother and father told me that wearing dresses and makeup would get me bashed, I just didnt think it would happen in Newtown. The inner-west Sydney suburb of Newtown has a reputation for being LGBTI-friendly. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, it has the second-highest number of female same-sex couples in the country. Keatinge posted a picture of his injuries to Facebook, writing that he wanted to remind people how lucky we are to live in a country where gay bashing is rare, unlike most of the world. I feel solidarity more than ever with our sisters around the globe who have been much more severely injured, bashed, tortured and killed, due to their gender expression or sexuality. View this image  NSW Greens Weve seen a huge increase in the amount of people coming to Newtown in recent times. Thats no surprise to anyone who lives or goes out in the area, she said. I think its clear the Kings Cross and CBD lockouts have had an impact. The laws introduced in 2013 include 1.30am lockouts and 3am last drinks in the CBD and Kings Cross areas. Leong said the Newtown area has long had a reputation of being safe for people of diverse sexualities, genders and cultures. The real challenge we have is to make sure that in the increase of people coming to the area we dont see a change in the culture, a change to the feeling of this being a safe community for people from diverse communities. Thats a challenging thing because its much harder to put in strict rules, regulations or laws that deal with those things. Its more about capturing the elusive vibe or feeling of a place, and thats a much harder thing to protect. Leong said that while there has been no across-the-board increase in assaults or antisocial behaviour reported to police, she has heard anecdotally of people experiencing low-level intimidation, heckling, rude remarks. Thats the kind of culture we need to work on to make sure it doesnt descend into something worse. Last year, the lockout laws were cited as a factor in the bashing of Stephanie McCarthy, a transgender musician, at the Town Hall Hotel in Newtown. Keatinge, who has lived in Newtown for four years, said its hard not to make the connection. People say its a clash of cultures, I think its the persecution of one culture. Organising group Reclaim The Streets hope the protest will draw attention to the escalating violence and intimidation in the once vibrant suburb. Spokesperson James Loch said the lockout laws have increased harassment, bullying and intimidation in the Newtown area.We all came to Newtown to avoid that kind of bullshit, but thanks to Casino Mike [NSW Premier Mike Baird] it has followed us here.

aS"Laura Jane Grace, the lead singer of punk rock band Against Me!, said she will not cancel her concert in the state as a form of protest. Barry Brecheisen / AP Richard Shotwell/Invision / AP North Carolina lawmakers passed House Bill 2 on March 23 which overrides local LGBT ordinances in the state and bans transgender people from certain restrooms. The legislation has triggered a wave of protests and increasing corporate backlash with several companies refusing to expand in the state and high-profile performers canceling their events. However, Grace, has publicly stated she will not cancel her May 15 concert despite the ongoing backlash. In an interview with BuzzFeed News on Wednesday, the singer, who publicly came out as transgender in 2012, said, Im going to create an event around the show as a form of protest to say that despite whatever stupid laws they enact, trans people are not going to be scared. They are not going to go away. Grace called the laws focus on restroom usage ridiculous. An attack by a transgender person against another person in a bathroom has never been documented, she said. There are more incidents of straight senators having issues in bathrooms than transgender people. It was suggested to me in an interview that we might cancel our May 15th show in Durham, NC because of the states HB2 bill. Hell no! (1/2) I think the real danger with HB2 is that it creates a target on transgender people specifically, Grace said. When you feel targeted as a trans person, the natural inclination is to go into hiding. But visibility is more important than ever; to go there and have the platform of a stage to stand on and speak your mind and represent yourself. However she commended performers like Springsteen, and Bryan Adams who canceled his concert in Mississippi over its anti-LGBT law for being allies. Bryan Adams and Bruce Springsteen arent transgender, Grace said. For them to say, I think this bill is messed up and Im not going to go here and be part of the state, that seems like the effort of an ally, which is really commendable. But Grace said that the transgender people who live in North Carolina dont have the option to boycott the state. They live here. They pay taxes. They are prisoners to it. While Grace acknowledged that someone like Springsteen canceling his concert brought a lot of attention to the issue, she said, no one would care if we canceled. View this image  The singer said the band had opened up their concert to all LGBT organizations in the state to table the event and hand out information to audiences who werent familiar with the issue. She also plans to call on everyone to use gender-neutral restrooms at the venue as an act of protest. Grace said that a lot of the bands songs tackle trans issues and speak about trans rights but that she would also address it on stage. This is all kind of happening in the moment, she said.

aS"It does nothing but divide our state, said Gov. John Bel Edwards. View this image  AP / Gerald Herbert Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards issued an executive order Wednesday that protects LGBT state workers from discrimination and bans LGBT discrimination in state contracts and also rescinds an order by his Republican predecessor. In 2015, former Gov. Bobby Jindal signed a marriage and conscience executive order to protect those who exercise their religious beliefs opposing same-sex couples marrying. But Edwards a Democrat said Jindals decree was inconsistent with the object and principles of his efforts to protect LGBT people from discrimination. In a press release explaining his decision, Edwards said Jindals order served a narrow political agenda. It does nothing but divide our state and forced the business community, from Louisianas smallest businesses to large corporations, like IBM, to strongly oppose it. We respect our fellow citizens for their beliefs, but we do not discriminate based on our disagreements, he said. Edwardss order also bars state agencies from discriminating in employment, contracts, or the provision of services on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, political affiliation, disability, or age. The contractor rules do not apply to religious corporations or religious schools. The order states that it should not be read to conflict with the states 2010 Preservation of Religious Freedom Act, which bans the government from substantially burdening a persons exercise of religion, unless it shows a compelling government interest.

aS"BuzzFeed News reached out to nearly two dozen companies that have come out against North Carolinas HB2 and have given to the Republican Governors Association. Not one company said theyd be changing their political donations. View this image  Gov. Pat McCrory Davis Turner / Getty Images WASHINGTON When North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory signed a controversial LGBT law, dozens of major corporations quickly came out and condemned it, telling him in a letter they were disappointed in his decision to sign this discriminatory legislation into law. But many of those companies and influential trade associations that represent them will likely continue to financially support the group backing McCrorys re-election bid, the Republican Governors Association. RGA, which is set up as a 527 political organization and therefore eligible for corporate donations, has raised millions over the years from companies such as Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Dow Chemical, Pfizer, Citigroup, and Pepsi Co. all of whom signed a letter to McCrory last month criticizing the law, which limits protections for the LGBT community and requires people to use bathrooms based on the sex listed on their birth certificate. McCrory attempted to clarify the law on Tuesday, allowing private companies to set their own policies on restrooms, but his executive order kept the contentious elements intact. Although the group supports Republican governors across the country, RGA will spend a significant amount of its resources in 2016 focusing on the Tar Heel state. McCrorys re-election battle against Democrat Roy Cooper is expected be one of the closest gubernatorial contests in the country this cycle. Another state where the RGA will spend some resources is Indiana, where some of the same companies criticized Indiana Gov. Mike Pences decision to sign a religious freedom law last year. BuzzFeed News reached out to nearly two dozen companies and trade groups that have given to RGA in the past to become corporate members of the group and have come out against the North Carolina law. None of them said they would be making any changes in their giving over the law. (Felicia McLemore, a spokeswoman for Marriott International, was the only one to say the company did not anticipate making such contributions this year, but said that wasnt necessarily a result of the law). A few, including California-based tech company Cisco, said their giving would continue. Cisco has had equal membership in both the Republican and Democratic Governors Associations for many years, said spokeswoman Andrea Duffy said in an email. Our involvement has never been about any specific party or candidate, Duffy wrote. We use our memberships to educate members on issues of importance to the tech industry and our funds are directed towards non-political purposes. We anticipate continued focus on these areas, and dont expect our support to go up or down based on partisan topics. On Wednesday, Duffy said that the company sends a letter yearly to both RGA and DGA s directed toward non-political purposes. Others either declined to comment on their plans to give to RGA, beyond their public criticism of the law, or did not respond to repeated calls and emails. RGA also declined to comment. Most major companies looking to influence policy or maintain their relationship with lawmakers on the state level typically give to both Democratic and Republican gubernatorial groups. Although they didnt waste any time in criticizing McCrorys decision, not giving to to the RGA especially at a time when Republicans control the majority of statehouses and governorships is a much more difficult decision. Companies could risk missing out on facetime with governors and further straining the partys coalition of pro-business and social conservatives, GOP fundraisers say. Even though shareholders for public corporations are becoming increasingly curious about political giving, it could set a precedent where companies have re-evaluate their contributions anytime theres a controversial bill. These big corporations have been acting in bad faith, said Brad Todd, a GOP consultant who worked for now-Sen. Thom Tillis campaign in North Carolina in 2014, about the business community siding with the left on religious and LGBT issues. Large businesses would be wise to be very careful. McCrory signed the bill late last month in response to an ordinance from Charlotte allowing transgender people to use bathrooms based on the gender they identify with. The passage of the law has already resulted in PayPal canceling plans to invest in the state, which could reportedly cost North Carolina 400 jobs. Musicians like Bruce Springsteen have also canceled appearances in the state, citing the law. Despite the criticism and attacks from Democrats, Republicans who have experience handling statewide races in North Carolina insist McCrory made the right political calculation one that might seem odd outside of the Tar Heel state but makes sense in a purple state that still has a sizable number of conservative Democrats. Republicans point to a survey by right-leaning think tank Civitas Institute, which found in a poll that 69% of those surveyed believed the Charlotte ordinance to be unreasonable and unsafe. Most acknowledge that it wasnt ideal for this issue to come up in an election year, but believe the Republican base would have viewed vetoing the bill as McCrory caving. Some are even pushing back on attacks that McCrory is hurting the states economy by blaming the companies, alleging they are being hypocritical in condemning the North Carolina law while continuing to operate and invest in countries with bad human rights records. They do business in Cuba, which has a horrible human rights record, said Dallas Woodhouse, executive director of the NC GOP, when asked about PayPal. People dont want PayPal telling them what to do when it comes to their kids bathrooms and locker rooms. Ferrell Blount, a businessman and former NC GOP chairman, made a similar argument: Bank of America operates in Saudi Arabia. I mean we know what goes on in Saudi Arabia with gay people. 2.

aS"Sun Wenlin and Hu Mingliang filed a lawsuit after a local officials refused to give them a marriage certificate. A judge threw out the suit Wednesday, but the couple has vowed to appeal. View this image  Sun Wenlin, right, and Hu Mingliang. China Stringer Network / Reuters A judge in China has thrown out the first ever lawsuit over same sex-marriage in the country, thwarting the efforts of a couple who tried to marry last year. Sun Wenlin and Hu Mingliangs lost their bid Wednesday to get married, the Associated Press reported. A local civil affairs bureau in Hunan Province reportedly denied the two men a marriage registration certificate in 2015, prompting them to file a lawsuit in December. The lawsuit was the first of its kind for China, according to multiple reports, though other LGBT couples in the country have previously held informal marriage ceremonies. The couples case has been celebrated by LGBT activists in China, which does not currently recognize same-sex marriage. Before the ruling was handed down Wednesday, hundreds of supporters gathered at the court, the AP reported. WATCH: Couple behind China's first gay marriage case has a powerful message for the LGBT community. The couple met in 2014, according to CNN. Sun reportedly asked Hu to marry him after they saw the movie Pride. After the case was delayed earlier this year, Sun said he felt too powerless. Despite losing Wednesday, Sun has vowed to appeal. Even if we were the only gay couple in the world, we should be allowed to marry! Sun told CNN in January. Its the basic human right and I ought to enjoy it. View this image  Weibo In the aftermath of the trials result, Chinese internet users have taken to Weibo and other platforms to discuss the outcome. Shi Fulong the couples lawyer has written four Weibo posts after the verdict so far, expressing both disappointment and belief in gaining back rights for the couple: Although they won the case today, the victory of the future belongs to us! View this image  Weibo Many of the most liked comments, such as this one from user Nadie, noted how the status quo promotes the existence of tongqi, a Chinese word short for wife of a gay man. Nadie wrote that to oppose same-sex marriage will cause the existence of more tongqi. According to Zhang Beichuan, a renowned scholar and doctor dedicated to studying LGBT issues in China, there are about 16 million women that are married to gay men in China. Chinese parents expects their children to get married and have children at certain ages, which imposes huge amounts of pressure on young people, especially for those who share their sexual orientations with their family in the first place. The available research shows more wives of gay men than husbands of gay women. At the same time, official Chinese research shows that 30 million Chinese men will be unable to find wives by the year of 2020, which is only four years from now. This is largely due to the preference for boys under Chinas controversial former One-Child Policy, leaving a huge sex-ratio imbalance there are now 1.15 men for every woman in China.

aS"Gov. Pat McCrorys executive order, however, does nothing to change the contentious aspects of the law derided by opponents. View this image  AP / Gerry Broome North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory issued an executive order on Tuesday that attempts to quell the backlash to an anti-LGBT law he enacted last month, saying the order clarifies existing state law while increasing privacy and equality. The order, however, does not change elements of the statute that have been criticized by LGBT advocates and other opponents of the law. The order maintains a ban on transgender people using restrooms that match their gender in government buildings and schools. It also does not withdraw a ban on cities enacting nondiscrimination ordinances that protect LGBT people. Rather, the order reaffirms that private businesses can establish their own rules for restrooms and locker rooms. It also purports to expand the states employment policy by saying state agencies may not engage in unlawful discrimination in employment practices on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. However, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal agency, already holds that employers may not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Furthermore, the EEOCs gender-identity interpretation which the Obama administration has backed up would maintain that the restroom restrictions that remain in place for transgender employees under the North Carolina law are a type of unlawful discrimination. I know these actions will not totally satisfy everyone, but the vast majority of our citizens want commonsense solutions to complex issues, McCrory said in a video statement. McCrory has repeatedly suggested that transgender women must be banned from womens restrooms because they would prey on women and girls a scenario never documented in the 17 states and 225 cities that currently ban transgender discrimination. Chase Strangio, a lawyer for the ACLU, told BuzzFeed News in a statement, This order in no way changes the many and serious harms of House Bill 2. Perhaps most concerning, Strangio said, it reiterates the anti-trans components of the law. It is nothing short of a political ploy to manage the backlash while still harming the most vulnerable members of the community and leaving the entire LGBT community without comprehensive legal protections. Numerous businesses have protested the North Carolina law, and the state was sued in federal court. In his order Tuesday, Gov. McCrory also encouraged state legislators to amend the law so that discrimination lawsuits could be filed in state court if someone believes they are wrongly fired. Gov. McCrory issued a video statement saying the debate around the law had created a great deal of misinformation, misinterpretation, confusion, a lot of passion, and frankly, selective outrage and hypocrisy. youtube.com Its obvious that Gov. McCrory is trying to save his reputation with this desperate move, said Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality. The order does nothing to change the government-mandated discrimination against all trans people in public buildings across the state. If Gov. McCrory thinks anyone is going to fall for this, he has completely underestimated North Carolinians and the rest of the nation, said Keisling.

Smooth a pea-sized amount of the primer onto the area of skin where you need it. It will dry to a matte finish, on top of which you can then apply foundation Apply it all the way down the neck for complete coverage. Products Used: On Kara, Prata applied Urban Decay Pore Perfecting Complexion Primer Potion with a MAC Cosmetics 193 Angled Foundation Brush. Drugstore Option: Revlon PhotoReady Perfecting Primer, $10.39. Lauren Zaser / Via BuzzFeed Lauren Zaser / Via BuzzFeed Permanent hair removal is expensive so a lot of trans women struggle with concealing facial hair. This technique will help to conceal any facial hair and pores that may have become larger over time because of shaving. Pressing foundation into the skin rather than wiping helps to really hide the pores, and the makeup can sit on top of the skin. Whenever youre covering hair, you want to change the tone (color) and use something that has an orange or red undertone for better concealing, Prata explained. Heres even more information on what the stippling technique actually does. Products Used: On Kacey, Prata used Dermablend Cover Creme in the shade Chroma. She brush shes using is the MAC Cosmetics 190 Foundation Brush. Drugstore Option: Maybelline Fit Me! Matte + Poreless Foundation, $5.99 View this image  Many trans women struggle with wanting to make their faces appear less broad and sharply angled. Contouring can make a big difference. Start just outside the jaw, stippling this product as well. Then, move to the forehead, along the temples, and onto the neck. Keep going on the perimeters of the face with the darker color. Contouring will help to soften the bone structure and the muscles, Prata said. Then, use the foundation color that matches your skin tone in the center area of your face (the nose, the forehead, chin, and cheeks) and blend the two shades together with your brush until you cant see where one begins and another ends. Products Used: On Kacey, Prata used Dermablend Cover Creme in the shade Toasted Brown. She brush shes using is the MAC Cosmetics 190 Foundation Brush. Drugstore Option: Maybelline Fit Me! Matte + Poreless Foundation, $5.99 Dont use a sweeping motion. Gently pressing the brush with powder into your face will help to give a smooth finish. You can apply the powder to your ears, too, so that all of your skin has a similar texture. Even if the powder appears thick at first, it will settle in about 30 minutes, Prata said. The powder will absorb any oils from your skin that could otherwise make the makeup slip off. Products Used: On Kara, Prata used MAC Cosmetics Mineralize Skinfinish Natural in the shade Medium. The brush is MAC Cosmetics 134 Large Powder Brush. Drugstore Option: Rimmel Stay Matte Pressed Powder in the shade Transparent, $3.99. Lauren Zaser / Via BuzzFeed Lauren Zaser / Via BuzzFeed When picking a blush color, keep in mind that the lighter the color, the less dramatic the look. If you choose to use a liquid blush instead, the easiest way to apply it is with your fingers, blending until there arent any fine lines or spots.

High Definition Powder in the shade Translucent, $3 Lauren Zaser / Via BuzzFeed Lauren Zaser / Via BuzzFeed Think of it like hairspray for your face: It keeps things in place. Its not something that you need to use every day, but its especially helpful on hot days (when you could sweat off your makeup) and long nights (when youve got somewhere to be and you dont want to be doing a lot of touch-ups). Product Used: On Kacey, Prata used Urban Decay All Nighter Makeup Setting Spray.   Drugstore Option: LOreal Paris Infallible Pro Spray & Set Makeup Extender Setting Spray, $13.79. View this image  Apply concealer lightly underneath eyes with your fingers. Extend a little bit past the eye towards the temple, but focus on the area underneath your eye and closer to the bridge of your nose where most of the shadow tends to come from, Prata said. Concealer also comes in a few different shades for color correction, which is meant to be used underneath concealer that matches your skin tone. If youre looking for coverage of purplish dark circles, choose a concealer with a salmon or orangey tone. If you need coverage of a pimple or blemish, use a concealer with a green tint. These concealer shades will cancel out any discoloration on your face, which can then be completely covered up with the shade that matches your skin tone.

Keeping your brushes and the rest of your tools clean will help to make sure that your application is as smooth as possible. Cleaning brushes about once a week in a solution of warm water and soap will get rid of any bacteria that may be going on your face from the brush.

Lauren Zaser / Via BuzzFeed Lauren Zaser / Via BuzzFeed Dont add pigment to the areas that are already full. Instead, just focus on the areas that need filling in instead of looking at the whole eyebrow at once. No eyebrows are identical, so dont try to do the same thing on one brow that you did on the other, Prata explained. You can use a spoolie eyebrow brush to brush through your brows and smooth everything out once youre done.

Drugstore Option: Almay Brow Defining Pencil, $5.99. Lauren Zaser / Via BuzzFeed Lauren Zaser / Via BuzzFeed Use the pads of your finger to apply the product. Using a long-wearing base color like this will help other eyeshadows adhere to the eye for a longer period of time. Another option is to use an eyeshadow primer first, like the Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion. Products Used: On Kara, Prata used MAC Cosmetics Pro Longwear Paint Pot in the shade Painterly. Drugstore Options: Maybelline Eye Studio Color Tattoo in the shade Creamy Beige, $6.99 Lauren Zaser / Via BuzzFeed Lauren Zaser / Via BuzzFeed For the eyeshadow, Use a light, shimmery color [like Urban Decays eyeshadow in Strange] right on the eyelid and pack onto the ball of the eye for highlighting, Prata says. But if you want your eyes to appear just a little bit larger, use a fluffy eyeshadow brush to sweep a very soft brown eyeshadow [like Urban Decays eyeshadow in the shade Limit] in the crease of your eyelid. The crease is the line between the top of your eyeball and the brow bone. Then, use a small flat brush to apply a brown eyeshadow shade [like Urban Decay eyeshadow in the shade Nooner] along the lower lash line. Keep it really subtle. Less is more. For a natural look, pull colors that would appear on your skin naturally, Prata explained.

Lauren Zaser / Via BuzzFeed Lauren Zaser / Via BuzzFeed Keep the line thin and go half way, then dip the brush back into the liquid for the second half. Use the side of the brush and keep the line nice and tight. Use pointed Q-tips to clean off any smudges. If you have trouble using liquid eyeliner, doing your mascara first may help, since it provides somewhat of a shelf for application.

For more information on exactly what to do with eyeliner, read this post. View this image  Wiggle the wand back and forth as youre applying. Direct the mascara towards the outer corner. In the center, lift the wand straight up, Prata explained. Also, never pump the mascara wand into the tube to get more mascara on the wand. This will pump air into the tube, which will only dry the mascara. Instead, swirl it around in the tube. Product Used: On Diana, Prata used LOreal Voluminous Miss Manga Mascara in the shade Black, which is a drugstore product that costs $7.99. View this image  You can use pointed Q-tips to remove stray marks anywhere on your face, but theyre especially helpful around the eye area because everything is so small and detailed. Just dampen the tip with a bit of water but make sure its not so wet that water is dripping out of the cotton. The wetness will help lubricate the makeup so it can lift off of your face.

aS"Nick Jonas, Demi Lovato, Pearl Jam, Cirque du Soleil, Bruce Springsteen, Bryan Adams, PayPal, and Deutsche Bank are among those who have canceled plans to perform, work, and expand in the states over the recent anti-LGBT laws. View this image  Protesters against North Carolinas anti-LGBT law. North Carolina lawmakers passed House Bill 2 on March 23, which overrides local LGBT nondiscrimination ordinances in the state and bans transgender people from certain restrooms. And on March 30, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant signed into law House Bill 1523, which protects people, religious organizations, and certain businesses that refuse services due to their religious opposition to same-sex marriage, and also protects those who object to transgender people and refuse to recognize their gender identity. View this image  The pop rock band announced on Friday, May 20 that it had cancelled its performances in Charlotte and Raleigh in light of House Bill 2. This was a difficult decision for us to make as a band, their statement read. We dont want to penalize our fans in North Carolina by not performing for them, but in the end it comes down to what we feel is morally right as we feel everyone should be treated equally. View on Instagram Singers Nick Jonas and Demi Lovato canceled tour appearances in North Carolina because of HB2, Jonas announced on social media on April 25. The pair had been due to perform as part of their Honda Civic: Future Now tour in Charlotte on June 30 and in Raleigh on July 2. North Carolinas discriminatory HB2 law is extremely disappointing, and it takes away some of the LGBT communitys most basic rights and protections, Jonas wrote. But we will not allow this to stop us from continuing to make progress for equality and acceptance. View this image  The Seattle rock icons announced in a statement they were canceling their April 20 show in Raleigh, North Carolina, saying the HB2 law that was recently passed is a despicable piece of legislation that encourages discrimination against an entire group of American citizens. The band said they will be contributing money to groups within the state who are working to overturn HB2, including the North Carolina chapter of the NAACP and the LGBT Center of Raleigh. The full statement: It is with deep consideration and much regret that we must cancel the Raleigh show in North Carolina on April 20th. This will be upsetting to those who have tickets and you can be assured that we are equally frustrated by the situation. The HB2 law that was recently passed is a despicable piece of legislation that encourages discrimination against an entire group of American citizens. The practical implications are expansive and its negative impact upon basic human rights is profound. We want America to be a place where no one can be turned away from a business because of who they love or fired from their job for who they are. It is for this reason that we must take a stand against prejudice, along with other artists and businesses, and join those in North Carolina who are working to oppose HB2 and repair what is currently unacceptable. We have communicated with local groups and will be providing them with funds to help facilitate progress on this issue. In the meantime we will be watching with hope and waiting in line for a time when we can return. Perhaps even celebrate. With immense gratitude for your understanding, Pearl Jam View this image  The internationally-acclaimed, Canada-based circus troupe announced on April 15 that it had suspended its performances in three North Carolina cities due to House Bill 2. Cirque du Soleil strongly believes in diversity and equality for every individual and is opposed to discrimination in any form. The new HB2 legislation passed in North Carolina is an important regression to ensuring human rights for all, its statement read. The company added that it had therefore decided to cancel its performances in Greensboro, Raleigh, and Charlotte, which had been scheduled for April, June, and July, respectively. Cirque du Soleil said that its belief in equality for all is a principle that guides us with both our employees and our customers. We behave as change agents to reach our ultimate goal of making a better world with our actions and our productions. Customers who purchased tickets to the now-cancelled shows will be automatically reimbursed.

The show was originally schedule to take place on June 18. Im sorry to disappoint my fans in the area, but we need to take a stand against this hatred. Spread peace and love, he said in a statement posted on his Facebook page. The musician went on to say that the legislation potentially opened the door for widespread discrimination because of the limitations it placed on anti-discrimination laws. How sad that they feel that this group of people cannot be defended, Starr said. View this embed  View this image  PayPal canceled its plans on April 5 to open a new global operations center in Charlotte that would have employed more than 400 people. In the short time since then, legislation has been abruptly enacted by the State of North Carolina that invalidates protections of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender citizens and denies these members of our community equal rights under the law, the company said in a statement from president and CEO Dan Schulman. The new law perpetuates discrimination and it violates the values and principles that are at the core of PayPals mission and culture. As a result, PayPal will not move forward with our planned expansion into Charlotte. View this image  Deutsche Bank announced on April 12 that it was freezing plans to create 250 new jobs in North Carolina due to the states anti-LGBT law. The German global banking giant employs some 900 people at its software application development center in Cary, North Carolina, but said it was freezing plans for an expansion of jobs there in protest against the law. We take our commitment to building inclusive work environments seriously, Co-CEO John Cryan said in a statement. Were proud of our operations and employees in Cary and regret that as a result of this legislation we are unwilling to include North Carolina in our U.S. expansion plans for now. We very much hope that we can re-visit our plans to grow this location in the near future, he said. View this image  Springsteen canceled his April 10 concert in Greensboro, saying in a statement that the legislation was an attempt by people who cannot stand the progress our country has made in recognizing the human rights of all of our citizens to overturn that progress. He said he was canceling the performance to show solidarity with the groups, businesses, and individuals who were fighting against the law. Some things are more important than a rock show and this fight against prejudice and bigotry which is happening as I write is one of them, Springsteen said. It is the strongest means I have for raising my voice in opposition to those who continue to push us backwards instead of forwards. View this image  At least 13 conventions in Charlotte were canceled over concerns over the bill, city officials told the Charlotte Observer. Four groups had canceled booked events, and nine others who were considering the city backed out, Charlotte Regional Visitors Authority spokeswoman Laura White told the Observer. Another 29 were on a hesitant/concerned list. If the 29 groups representing professional associations, trade shows, and corporate events decided to back out, the city would lose more than 103,000 hotel nights, White said. Here's the breakdown from @CLTTourism on upcoming conventions in #CLT b/c of #HB2 @wcnc More info to come In a March 28 statement, Charlotte Regional Visitors Authority CEO Tom Murray said: We are extremely concerned about the state legislation in place as we continue to hear negative feedback and potential event cancellations from our customers. Our city has worked incredibly hard to build a thriving visitor economy over the last 20 years, which has welcomed major events and conventions that greatly give back to the city and the state of North Carolinas economy and overall quality of life. This issue is in danger of setting us back from the progress weve made in positioning Charlotte as an attractive, inclusive destination. Our city has long had a track record of creating an environment that not only values diversity, but strongly embraces it. On behalf of the visitor economy that represents one in nine jobs across the Charlotte region, we strongly urge that state and local leaders find a resolution that represents the best interests of our city and state. The High Point Market Authority, billed as the largest economic event in North Carolina every year, said in a statement that hundreds and perhaps thousands of our customers will not attend Market this April, based on the initial response of its attendees to the bill. In the last few days, dozens of customers have contacted the High Point Market Authority to inform us that they have cancelled plans to attend the Market in April due to passage of HB2, its statement said. There are also several campaigns on social media calling for a boycott of the High Point Market this spring. The market, which claims to generate over 600,000 visitor days to the state every year, with an annual economic impact of $5.38 billion, said that the HB2 is having a significant economic damage on the High Point Market and the states economy. We would like to take this opportunity to clearly state that the High Point Market does not discriminate, regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation or gender identity, the statement said. In fact, we embrace all of our attendees and believe that the diversity of the 75,000 people who attend Market is one of our greatest assets and strengths. HA! Good move! https://t.co/GD3cvJCb7n blocks North Carolina users in response to the states anti-LGBT bill - https://t.co/1SSyAVdX89 The porn site xHamster has restricted access to its website in North Carolina, according to the chief marketing officer, adding that that company knows what it means to be hypocritically labelled by society. Our goal is to fight for the equality for everyone and we will stand our ground, Alexander Hawkins said in an email. Everybody has a right to their own sexuality and xHamster is there to love and support people the way they are. Hawkins said that respecting others sexuality may not come easy, but it is something we must all work together to address.

Theres some 1,700 of them in the world, and they include Etsy, Patagonia, and Ben and Jerrys. Some 550 people affiliated with B Corporations mostly company CEOs were supposed to gather in North Carolina in October for a series of conferences. The passing of HB2, however, has forced the group to change its meeting place. Tuesdays Executive Order by Governor McCrory does not alter our decision to relocate our October events, the group said in a statement. The order does not remove limitations on public restroom access, which directly affect the safety and comfort of our attendees, nor does it restore municipalities ability to support a living wage. Through an executive order, Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski banned the use of city money to travel to both North Carolina and Mississippi as a protest against the new laws, Fox 13 reported. The mayor and the local city council also issued an open letter inviting businesses that feel uncomfortable working in states with anti-LGTBQ legislation to move to Utah instead. For its part, the Cincinnati City Council voted to ban all non-essential travel to North Carolina and Mississippi using municipal funds, Fox 19 reported. In a statement on Facebook, City Councilmember Chris Seelbach said the council would work to bring the good paying jobs leaving these states because of these egregious laws to Cincinnati. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed an executive order on March 28, banning all non-essential state travel to North Carolina. In a statement, Cuomo said: In New York, we believe that all people regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation deserve the same rights and protections under the law. From Stonewall to marriage equality, our state has been a beacon of hope and equality for the LGBT community, and we will not stand idly by as misguided legislation replicates the discrimination of the past. As long as there is a law in North Carolina that creates the grounds for discrimination against LGBT people, I am barring non-essential state travel to that state. Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy on March 31, also signed an executive order banning state-funded travel to North Carolina. In a statement, Malloy said: When we see discrimination and injustice, we have to act. This law is not just wrong, it poses a public safety risk to Connecticut residents traveling through North Carolina. Thats why I have signed an executive order banning state-funded travel to the state. This law endangers the welfare not just of North Carolinas citizens, but of all people visiting that state. A physics group on Aug. 4 cancelled a 2018 scientific conference in Charlotte over North Carolinas bathroom bill. The American Physical Society atomic physics meeting usually generates about $5 million in tourism revenue for its location city. The situation in North Carolina is untenable for trans physicists, said Johns Hopkins University physicist Michael Falk, who chaired a March APS report calling for better welcoming trans and non-gender conforming people in academia. It is imperative for APS to continue to uphold its longstanding policy of not locating conferences in places where some members would risk legalized discrimination or criminalization for simply being themselves, he said, in a statement. APS is one of the worlds leading physics organization, with 53,000 members. The 2018 atomic physics group meeting will instead be held in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

I cannot in good conscience perform in a State where certain people are being denied their civil rights due to their sexual orientation. Therefore im cancelling my 14 April show at the Mississippi Coast Coliseum. Using my voice I stand in solidarity with all my LGBT friends to repeal this extremely discriminatory bill. Hopefully Mississippi will right itself and I can come back and perform for all of my many fans. I look forward to that day.

She was super cool about it, not much to tell there. I immediately went to tell my dad when we got home. He was watching a Raptors game. I went over to him, said we needed to talk and told him that Im gay. His response was literally to grab my hand, and tell me how wonderful it was and that he loves me no matter what my sexuality is, before asking if it was okay for him to go back to watching the game. Amazingly chill.   Mary Walpole, Facebook I was in the car with my mom and we had just come back from swimming when I told her I was bisexual.

Hes great.   rkashew View this image  I came out to my parents one at a time, and yet both of them had the exact same response: OK, but you still want kids, right!?   Apidae I always knew I was a lesbian always wanted to wear my brothers close, loved my sports and thought other girls were soo cute. To me it wasnt obvious that everyone kinda knew already and I was scared to come out and say that I was gay. I remember the first time it was ever brought up, my mom and I went to get the mail one day and I think I was about 11. I get out, grab the mail, and mom casually looks at me and asks, so you gay? I said I think so and that was it. I had it easy because really I never had to come out. I wish it was this easy for everyone. Thanks mom and dad for being so supportive :)   sarahh57 This is more a coming-out-to-me story: My good friend sits me down and hes super flustered and nervous and starts this long and clearly prepared speech about how he has some shocking news that may disturb me but that he hopes it wont change our friendship and how Im the first person hes had this conversation with. He takes a deep breath, about to reveal this earth-shattering news and tells me Im gay. I just looked at him and went Yes, and? I think he was actually a little put out no one was surprised, but please: wed gone to a gay bar for his 19th birthday and I gave him a card with a glow-in-the-dark cock ring inside. This was not a shocker. Moral of the story: the people who love you, love you, regardless. And also probably already know.   Jessica Davey-Quantick, Facebook Im an out lesbian, so Ive come out to multiple people in multiple ways, but the funniest time was when I was in a group meeting.

Were both gay!   Jessica Lenz, Facebook View this image  Of all the different ways I came out as trans, I think the best part was when I did a newspaper interview about gender-neutral bathrooms as an openly-trans student at my university. The people who I cared most about knowing already knew, especially since Id already been on hormones for a few months. But anyone who didnt already know (including some family members I was still afraid to tell) wouldve found out the moment they picked up the paper that day.  Ryan Michael Wildgoose, Facebook I am a fourth year university student in Canada, and I came out to a lot of my peers recently when I was published in my universitys lifestyle and culture magazine. I wrote an article called Coming Out and Speaking Out, in which I talked about not fitting the stereotypes and norms surrounding gay women. I was a little nervous to come out so publicly, but I am super passionate about spreading the message that stereotypes surrounding the gay community can be really inaccurate and harmful. I think coming out this way could help others out there feeling the way I did not too long ago.   Emily Duncan, email Emily Duncan Emily Duncan I was going to school in Victoria, B.C., and my family was in California, and I decided the perfect time to come out was on the ferry ride to Vancouver, where I was going for Thanksgiving. It hadnt occurred to me that phone reception in the middle of the Georgia Strait might not be ideal as my mom had to piece together my coming out while my phone kept cutting in and out, but major points to her for figuring it out.   laurat4a3d23b73 I guess when I was texting my uncle saying I wanted to tell him something I was a bit too vague cause when I came out to him later he said, oh good I thought you were pregnant!   e406c4544e I was so nervous about telling my dad. Like, to the point where he was one of the last people to find out. I even posted it on my blog before telling him, which actually turned out to be a good thing.

Totally!  emmastolp View this image  I told my dad that Im a lesbian back when I was 15 and he was so happy that I wont be dating boys that he seriously offered to bake me a cake.

One of my friends had invited me to her beach house, but her parents had a no boys rule. My friend told her parents it was OK because I was gay (I was out to her already). I was recounting this story to my parents at dinner and they thought it was *hilarious* that anyone would think I was gay because my brother had come out a year prior. My parents favourite phrase was wrong sibling whenever there was a gay rumour about me. So Im telling this story about how my friend told her parents I was gay, and my parents laugh and say wrong sibling! to which I slowly raised my hand and went actually, right sibling. My dad started choking on his salad; so much so that he had to leave the restaurant to catch his breath.

aS"They both vow to take action as president but how, exactly? View this image  AP / Mic Smith On Friday, Bernie Sanders vowed to challenge two recently approved state laws that target LGBT people for discrimination. As president of the United States, I would do everything I can do to overturn those outrageous decisions by Mississippi and North Carolina, Sanders told ABCs The View, without elaborating on how, exactly, he might do that. BuzzFeed News asked what specific actions he may take to nullify the laws, but his campaign did not reply. Asked the same question, Hillary Clintons campaign gave a slightly less vague answer. Whether through legal action in the courts, pursuing federal legislation, or using the bully pulpit to address actions in the states, Hillary Clinton will vigorously challenge anti-LGBT laws, spokesperson Xochitl Hinojosa said in an email. She has repeatedly spoken out against these discriminatory anti-LGBT laws and affirmed her commitment to fight for full equality for LGBT people, Hinojosa added. However, the type of legal action Clinton may pursue and if she would use executive authority, too remains unknown. Sanderss pledge is even lighter on details. Both candidates have jockeyed for the LGBT vote, a significant source of fundraising support and substantial bloc in large states with upcoming Democratic primaries, such as New York and California. Sanders has stressed he was ahead of the curve supporting marriage equality, pointing to his vote against the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996. Clinton, meanwhile, has advocated for same-sex couples right to marry and touted her record as secretary of state, and her campaign issued a policy paper detailing her White House vision for federal LGBT rights. Yet, the question for many LGBT voters wont be which year the candidates first supported marriage equality the Supreme Court resolved the legal matter last June. Many LGBT voters are wondering how a president might react to the headline-grabbing, multistate backlash to the marriage ruling happening now. This year, legislatures have introduced an unprecedented number of bills to protect people of faith opposed to same-sex couples who get married, to limit access to marriage-related services, and to ban transgender people from restrooms that match their gender. Dan Rafter, a spokesman for Freedom for All Americans, a nonpartisan LGBT advocacy group, told BuzzFeed News on Monday, I think its a good thing candidates are talking about this, but people deserve to know what the exact path is to repeal these laws. The menu for a presidential response is limited but it does exist. Among the options: The federal government could support litigation filed by private parties, file its own lawsuits that allege states are violating civil rights laws, begin probes into state practices, and withhold federal funding. The Obama administration has cleared the way for using existing civil rights laws to argue transgender discrimination is illegal, even though Congress has not passed a law explicitly banning discrimination on the basis of gender identity. Likewise, the federal agency that enforces civil rights laws in the workplace has asserted discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is also prohibited. In courts, for example, the Department of Justice has filed statements of interest and an amicus brief to support a transgender boys right under Title IX to use school restrooms that match his gender identity. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, an independent agency that includes Obama appointees, has filed briefs to oppose discrimination in the workplace under Title VII on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation. The Justice Department sued a state university for discriminating against a transgender professor. Obama has also suggested he can close the purse. The Education Department said in a statement to BuzzFeed News that it is reviewing North Carolinas new law to determine any potential impact on the states federal education funding. The state is slated for $4.5 billion in federal education funds next year. Chase Strangio, a staff attorney for the ACLU and one of the lawyers in a suit challenging the North Carolina law, told BuzzFeed News that LGBT people are eager to see leadership that offers more than just platitudes, since the reality is that transgender people are literally dying because of discrimination and violence. Action and accountability require more than just the use of the bully pulpit. The community needs to see follow through and tangible steps taken by the federal government, he continued. And that is what I would be looking for from the candidates. The North Carolina law repealed local LGBT protections and banned transgender people from restrooms that match their gender in government buildings thereby clashing with the administrations interpretation of Title IX, which bans sex discrimination in public schools. The Mississippi law protects people and businesses that discriminate against LGBT people on religious grounds. The current administration or the next one could pursue and build on the same strategies in order challenge state laws. I think LGBT Americans and the country as a whole deserve to know where political candidates and elected officials stand on this and what their specific path for effecting change would be, said Rafter, who added that the Obama administration should be expeditious in deciding to withhold money from North Carolina. Withholding federal funds shows that it is not just rhetoric, but there is the potential for real repercussions, he said. Clinton, for her part, has said she shares Obamas interpretation of federal civil rights laws that they protect transgender people and has gone further by saying they also protect gays, lesbians, and bisexuals. But she has not said if, or how, that would shape litigation to challenge state laws. And it is unclear what Sanders may do. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

When we were looking for LGBTI fairytale picture books like ours we only managed to find a couple, he said. Many of the others were quite literal and more focused on sexuality than the story. Our story just happens to feature two lead characters who are youngmen that meet and fall in love, nobody questions that.

However, through a project like this I can at least try and be part of a solution that might ensure others wont have to feel the way I have in future.

aS"Broken Rainbow is about to fold because its government grant still hasnt arrived, staff told BuzzFeed News. View this image  Broken Rainbow The only national charity providing help and support to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people experiencing domestic violence is days from closure, BuzzFeed News can reveal. Last month, Broken Rainbow announced that if it did not receive 20,000 within a few weeks, the service, which includes a helpline that receives 10,000 calls per year, could fold. But now the entire operation is facing imminent closure, following what staff described as a delay from funders, including the Home Office. We are literally days from closure, Emma Baldry from Broken Rainbow told BuzzFeed News. We have the confirmation of funding from the Home Office but we still dont have the money in our bank. We havent had the contract to sign and therefore we havent received the payment. She added that it was expecting these funds, and reliant on them going through, by 1 April. We have 95,000 of agreed funds due to us over the next few weeks from various funders, including the government, she said. But the position we are currently in is that if we dont find 25,000 in the next 48 hours or so that could be the end of Broken Rainbow. Baldry explained: We dont have the money to pay our staff and we cant continue to run if we cant afford to pay our staff. View this image  Rebecca Hendin / BuzzFeed She said the charity has had no indication of when the money from the Home Office will arrive. Jo Harvey Barringer [the CEO] is currently sending letters and emails, chasing them saying, Look, this is the position we are in, can you speed this through any quicker? Baldry said the organisation has not yet received an answer. The charity is now trying desperately to find funds from elsewhere, speaking with other charity partners to see if they can lend Broken Rainbow money, and is considering putting together a last-minute fundraiser. Were also asking if anyone can hand in a hefty donation or provide us with a loan, said Baldry. We are guaranteed to get this 95,000 in, so even if it was a 25,000 loan for now, whoever can provide a loan will get that money back. The charity has tried unsuccessfully to get a bank loan, she added. If Broken Rainbow shuts its doors, said Baldry, it could put LGBT people at risk. Its so important to have the service because its already hard enough to tell someone youre in an abusive relationship, but if you have to come out to somebody before disclosing it that can be really hard, said Baldry. And that can be the point that puts people off from contacting other services because they might not be out. If we close, more people could stay in abusive relationships and therefore more LGBT people would be in danger. UPDATE A Home Office spokesman told BuzzFeed News: The Government is committed to tackling domestic violence and abuse. Broken Rainbow plays an important role in supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender victims of domestic abuse, and the Home Office has informed Broken Rainbow that it will be renewing funding to support its helpline for 2016/17. 3.

aS"Your genitals could probably use a check-up. View this image  Sex is great, and you should be able to enjoy it without worrying about all the sexually transmitted infections (STIs) out there. Thats why getting tested regularly just makes sense. Its a simple, quick, and relatively painless way to be a better, more thoughtful sex-haver. So we checked in with a few experts: Dr. Gail Bolan, Director of CDCs Division of STD Prevention; Dr. Peter Leone, professor of medicine at UNC School of Medicines Division of Infectious Diseases; and Dr. David Bell, medical director and chief physician at the Young Mens Clinic in New York. Heres what they want you to know about getting tested for STIs and HIV.   *Note this information is for anyone with a penis regardless of your gender identity or sexual orientation. View this image  And thats probably not your fault. Young men typically drop off from seeing a primary care provider around 15, says Bell. And since you arent going to the gynecologist every year, you probably dont have an annual opportunity to talk about sexual health with a physician. The culture around STI testing is very negative I think for men and women, says Bell. But for women, there can be an enveloping of those services around pregnancy prevention, so when theyre accessing services for contraception, STI services are a part of that. It doesnt have as much of a negative connotation as plain STI testing. Guys dont have a way around that. Basically, the responsibility to know when to get tested and for what seems to be on your shoulders, which is often why so many people dont. View this image  If you heard horror stories about or even experienced a Q-tip up the urethra, you might be understandably squeamish about getting tested. Luckily, thats not necessary anymore. At this point in time, if someone tells you you have to get a Q-tip, you should tell them you know for a fact you can urinate in a cup for a test, says Bell. Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis can be tested with a urine sample; while HIV, syphilis, herpes, and hepatitis B can all be tested with a blood test. Easy peasy. View this image  But my penis looks totally fine! Well, that doesnt mean much. The absence of symptoms certainly shouldnt assure someone that they dont have an STI, says Leone. In fact, the vast majority of people with genital herpes dont know they have it, according to the CDC. And some research has shown that up to 90% of men with chlamydia had no symptoms at all, says Bell. So if you only get tested when something is up with your penis, youre waiting too long. View this image  Some of the most common symptoms associated with STIs include: burning when you pee, an unusual discharge (from the urethra or rectum), rectal pain, or any sort of sore/ulcer/unusual bump around the genital area. With gonorrhea, the discharge could look like white or yellow pus, but with chlamydia it could look clear and sticky. Guys often confuse this with pre-ejaculate, says Bell, so if you notice a discharge thats not associated with an erection (and youve had unprotected sex), see a doctor. And keep in mind that symptoms arent always limited to your crotch area. Syphilis can also present with a rash on the hands and feet as well as vision changes, says Leone. And mouth sores could signal an oral infection. So basically, any weird lumps, bumps, or pains should be checked out. View this image  Everyone whos had sex should know their HIV status not only to avoid infecting others but also to get the appropriate care as soon as possible. The CDC recommends that everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 get tested for HIV at least once, but you should be retested depending on certain risk factors (outlined here). Bell and Leone suggest at the minimum getting tested for HIV any time you change partners that youve had unprotected sex with. So if youre newly single and you and your ex werent using condoms, get tested before you have a new partner so that you know your status going into your next relationship. View this image  According to the CDC, men who have sex with men (MSM) should get an HIV test at least once a year. But that recommendation also depends on your sexual and relationship status, says Bell. For instance, if you know youre in a mutually monogamous relationship (and have been since the last time you were tested together), or if youve been on a 16-month dry spell, you may not need to get retested that year. But if you have multiple partners, anonymous partners, or if your partner may have multiple partners, you may need an HIV test every three months, says Bell. View this image  Regardless of who youre having sex with. This way youll know youre chlamydia-, gonorrhea-, and syphilis-free before you have sex with someone else. Again, the CDC guidelines for MSM suggest STI screening at least once a year, or more often if youre at a higher risk (like if you have HIV, if you have multiple or anonymous partners, or if your partner may have other partners). High-risk individuals should get screened at 3- to 6-month intervals. View this image  Peeing in a cup can test for infections in your urethra, but thats not the only place you can have chlamydia and gonorrhea infections. Those can also occur in the throat and rectum, so if your mouth or anus comes into play during sex (like oral sex, rimming, pegging with a sex toy thats also been in your partner, etc.), then you should be testing those sites, too. Unless youre damn sure nothing has been in your throat or rectum, get it screened, says Leone. This is called extra-genital testing (meaning youre testing places other than your genitals) and many clinics, labs, and hospitals will offer these tests, says Leone. The thing is, you might have to be the one to ask for it. Unfortunately, most providers are uncomfortable talking about oral or anal sex, says Leone. View this image  The most crucial step for transgender individuals will be finding clinicians who are knowledgeable about and respectful of health issues affecting trans people, says Leone. Thats because your STI and HIV screening recommendations will differ depending on your parts, your partners parts, and the sites at which you have sexual contact. The technology is there to test you wherever youre having sex, says Leone, but having a provider who can ask the right questions in a safe and non-judgmental way will make all the difference. You can search for LGBT-friendly providers in your area here. View on Instagram A urine sample can pick up chlamydia and gonorrhea within a few days of exposure, but blood tests typically require more time to detect the antibodies of a virus. For instance, syphilis can take weeks to months to show up on test, so be wary of that when getting tested between partners. Some of the newer fourth-generation HIV tests can detect the virus as early as two weeks after exposure, while others can take up to a few months, says Bell. Thats why experts suggest HIV testing at 3- or 6-month intervals for anyone at a high risk. View this image  So you found out someone youre dating (or dated, or hooked up with, or whatever) has an STI. In most states, their doctor can actually give them an extra dose of antibiotics for you to take, which is called expedited partner therapy (you can check here to see if your state allows it). You should definitely still get tested (especially since having one STI can put you at a higher risk for others), but getting treated ASAP is also great. View this image  The main danger associated with untreated STIs is passing them to partners, says Leone. If you have a female partner, an untreated STI can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease and even infertility. But unknown STIs can affect your own body, too. Having one STI can put you at a higher risk for contracting other STIs and HIV. Untreated gonorrhea and chlamydia can sometimes lead to an infection in the testicles called orchitis, or scarring in the urethra; while HPV can be major risk factor for anal cancer. Untreated syphilis can lead to vision loss and damage to the internal organs and nervous system, which could be fatal. So just because you cant see it, cant feel it, and dont know you have it that doesnt mean its harmless. View this image  The experts recommend public health departments (find ones in your state here), Planned Parenthood clinics, or sexual health clinics for free or discounted screening. Or you might be able to get screened at your primary care doctor or an urgent care near you. You can also visit GetTested.CDC.gov to find testing centers near you. Put your zip code in and it gives you sites were aware of that you can generally access free, same-day appointments, says Bolan. View this image  HPV is incredibly common, and while most strains will clear up on their own, others can lead to genital warts or cancer. So if you didnt get the HPV vaccine when you were younger, you might still be able to catch up. The CDC recommends the vaccine for men through age 21, or through age 26 if you have sex with men or have a compromised immune system (including HIV infection). And you probably got the hepatitis B vaccine as an infant, but if you didnt, you can also get tested and vaccinated as an adult. View this image  PrEP is a daily medication that can reduce the sexual transmission of HIV by up to 92% when used consistently. The CDC recently found that roughly 1.2 million people should be taking it. Find out more about PrEP here, and talk to you doctor about whether or not youd be a good candidate. Theres also PEP, a medication that can reduce your chances of HIV infection when taken within 72 hours after youve been exposed. According to the CDC, if you think youve been exposed, you should ask your doctor or an emergency room physician about it as soon as possible. View this image  This is just a simple check-up with a physician (at your primary care office, a health department, sexual health clinic, etc.) where theyll ask you some questions about your sexual activities and your partners. Stuff like how many partners youve had, how often you use condoms, what kinds of body parts are usually involved when you have sex, etc. Be honest. If theyre not disclosing risk factors, they may not be tested when they need to be tested, says Bolan. I cant take good care of you if we cant have an honest discussion. They might even tell you that you dont need a test at this time, especially if youre in an area where STIs arent super prevalent and you dont have any risk factors. Youre still getting good care when a provider says Ive done your risk assessment and right now, getting this test isnt going to help you, says Bolan. View this image  Regardless of who you have sex with, how many partners youve had, or how consistently you use condoms, youre still responsible for knowing your status. That Im-not-the-type-of-person-who-gets-it is something we need to get past, says Leone. Being a sexually active adult, youre probably going to have an STI. It could be HPV or it could be something relatively rare. Its part of your health and wellbeing to just do this. Just go out and get screened. FYI: Most experts now use the term STI (sexually transmitted infections) rather than STD (sexually transmitted diseases), since most of the time these are infections without any visible symptoms. 18.

aS"Exclusive: Olly Alexander opened up to BuzzFeed News about what was behind his obsession with food and hatred for his own body. View this image  Tim P. Whitby / Getty Images Olly Alexander, the frontman of best-selling pop band Years & Years, has disclosed that he suffered from eating issues and an unhealthy relationship with his body for a decade. Speaking to BuzzFeed News on Friday during a Facebook Live event just hours before the bands biggest ever concert at Wembley Arena, the singer described how he battled with a fixation on food from his childhood until his early 20s as he was also coming to terms with his sexuality, his parents divorce, anxiety and depression. The problems began, he said, aged 10 when he started attending a local gymnastics class: It was the first time I was starting to have an awareness of my body and strength and [thought], Older boys, theyre really muscly and they could do things that I couldnt do and thats the point, from then onwards I started to have body issues and not eating, like I wouldnt eat. He explained: I was stuck between this place of being really, really, really skinny and hating it because I wanted to be muscly like other boys but at the same time didnt want to put on weight because that was bad as well. I struggled with it for a really long time actually. Facebook Facebook Facebook The issues around eating and body image carried on into early adulthood. For ten years at least really I would say I struggled with that, he said, adding that it involved skipping meals and constantly thinking about food andobsessing over what I ate and what was going into my body and hating my body in the mirror. Going without food, he said, was in part an attempt to feel more in control. Asked by BuzzFeed News whether he would describe his problem as an eating disorder he replied: I wouldnt want to call it that myself I was never diagnosed with an eating disorder but I definitely had a difficult relationship with food. However, that relationship has improved significantly, he said, thanks to a good support network and years of therapy: Ive looked at some of the causes that have been at the root of why I had not just problems with food but [also] there were links with depression and anxiety, and Ive started to really unpack some of those things. Although he now enjoys a healthier relationship with eating, Alexander stressed that he remains vigilant about it. Its really a life-long process, he said, that I think anyone thats experienced any mental distress or mental illness knows its something you manage its not something that just goes away. So its an ongoing thing.

I used to, before I went on stage, feel like, Im a terrible singer, [that] no ones going to like it, and all these people who bought tickets dont actually want to be here. Thanks to therapy, however, he now adopts a positive mental attitude: I just say to myself youre going to nail it, youre gonna be great. In a wide-ranging interview as the rest of the band were preparing for their performance in front of 10,000 fans Alexander continued with the theme of health and wellbeing, criticising the NHS for not making the drug that prevents HIV more widely available. Last month, NHS England announced that it would not be rolling out PrEP a medication regime that uses the drug Truvada to stop people contracting the virus. The announcement sparked widespread anger from HIV charities, doctors and activists. It concerned [me] mainly because I feel like it really stigmatised people living with HIV, said Alexander. I cant believe were still stigmatising or shaming people that have any sort of sexually transmitted illness but especially HIV because it feeds into this narrative that shames gay men especially, but not just gay men lots of people get HIV. View this image  Dimitrios Kambouris / Getty Images He added: I dont understand why anything thats a preventive drug is not a good thing. The cost of treating people with HIV far outweighs the cost of the drug that prevents it, he said, but increased discussion about the issue also needs to play a part. There needs to be more education and awareness around HIV because it just feels like weve gone back a bit, like, Its not a thing [anymore] or, Ooh Im gonna catch it from looking at you. Alexander, who said he had no sex education at school, added that it should be compulsory for pupils. The singer, who is gay, also spoke out about the need for schools to educate pupils around sexuality and gender, championing the cause of gender variant, trans and non-binary people identities that were explored in Years & Years video for Desire. Asked by BuzzFeed News if he had ever questioned his gender identity, Alexander replied: Oh my god, 100 per cent, before explaining, Im a cis[gender] male, I identify as a man but Ive never felt like a masculine male. Growing up, he said, people called him girly. View this image  Olly Alexander (right) in conversation with BuzzFeed News backstage at Wembley Arena Facebook I was like, Why do I have to be one thing or the other and why is that bad? I believe theres a fluidity to all of it really we still have these quite enforced binary norms in school. Its a process. But I do think its changing kids are really smart and are much more tolerant and understanding of things that older people arent getting. Much of this change has come about through social media, he said. Now we have this platform all these people who in the past didnt have a voice at all, now there are other people all round the world who share the same opinions or similar experiences. He added: You have a voice now and people have to listen.   Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Thomas was the one person who didnt ask me to be anything other than myself. Until he did. View this image  Jasu Hu for BuzzFeed News The summer after I turned 14, I started my first job at a yacht clubs beachside snack bar in Westchester County, New York, where Id go on to work 60-hour weeks and break any number of child labor laws. The snack bar was staffed by an unruly bunch of older teens and twentysomethings. One of the cooks was a guy Ill call Thomas. Gender was cleanly and efficiently demarcated in our little snack bar on the beach. Girls worked the front: taking orders, stocking fridges, discreetly texting on their BlackBerrys. Guys worked the back: cooking, wisecracking, lifting heavy objects. I didnt speak to Thomas, or to anyone, for at least a week, during which time I was also too afraid to eat anything. My fellow counter girls had to pull out all the stops to convince the cooks to make them an illicit meal or two: leaning on the counter that divided Girls World and Guys World, cycling through bouts of whining and flirting until one of the guys grudgingly agreed to make them chicken nuggets. I chatted with customers but otherwise hid in a corner, intimidated by co-workers three-plus years older than me, which, when youre in the ninth grade, might as well be an age gap of lifetimes. One sleepy, slow weekday afternoon, Thomas caught me in my corner. You OK, sweetheart? he asked. I was starving. He made me a bacon, egg, and cheese. Then he became my friend. Thomas, five years my senior, was lanky and lumbering, covered in tattoos, drily sarcastic with a heavy New York drawl. He was related to at least half of the people we worked with at any given time; he and his vast network of Italian-American cousins would constantly bicker across the counter. They all smoked. Soon enough, I did too, though I was bad enough at it not to inhale. Once you work in a kitchen, you quickly realize that smokers are the only ones afforded breaks. Thomas would join me sometimes, even though we were supposed to smoke in shifts. We had very little in common, besides a shared taste in music and families riddled with alcoholism. It was enough. That first summer, I lied to my parents and piled into a beat-up old Volvo with Thomas and a ragtag group of his grimy punk friends. We drove a couple hours north to the New York outpost of Warped Tour, where I saw Against Me! play for the first time. This was years before lead singer Laura Jane Grace publicly transitioned, years before I figured out I was gay. She would come to mean a lot to me, in terms of both music and queerness, but at the time Laura Jane and her band were simply a noisy backdrop to the culmination of my messy wants and fears. The whole event had an aggressively heterosexual sheen: In the pit, throwing our bodies up against one anothers, we were a bunch of hopped-up teenagers high on Red Bull, crashing through clouds of pheromones. What I wanted was for boys to like the idea of me, though I didnt know what I wanted them to do with that idea. I was scared of their rejection but their affection scared me more. I walked this dizzying plank summer after summer, testing my own limits. Every Fourth of July, wed throw a party. It was the biggest day of the season, popcorn and face painting and a steady stream of gin and tonics wed shepherd into the eager hands of yachters in seersucker suits. As soon as the fireworks started, our customers sated with their snacks and their booze, we would close up shop and get trashed in the alleyway out back, sprawled in smuggled beach chairs that scraped noisily across the cement floor. Wed drink Coronas and shoot the shit. One year, we snuck across the short stretch of cool, pebbly sand separating the snack bar from the pool and hopped the fence. All the club members were long gone. None of us brought bathing suits so we stripped to our underwear. Buoyed by the beer, my red polo work shirt stinking of grease and stained with dribbles of snack bar debris drifted easily over my shoulders. After a few delicious, drunken laps, I kissed one of the cooks on a dare. I was 14, maybe 15, and he was many years older. From the other end of the pool, through the expanse of water and muggy summer darkness, I felt Thomass gaze on me, watchful and disapproving and maybe even jealous. I felt simultaneously under his protection and more powerful than he could ever be. We got older. Thomas started a punk band. I applied to college. He broke up with his on-again, off-again girlfriend. I started dating a guy Id keep seeing for close to five years. During fall and winter Thomas and I would text, asking after each others families and significant others: Howre you doing, sweetheart? Then it was summer again, one bleeding with sticky heat and drunken hazes into the next, Thomas and I driving around Westchester in his shitty car after getting out of work, smoking and complaining about everyone in our lives whod let us down. Halfway through college, I landed a funded internship and didnt return to the snack bar for the first time in seven years. I grew apart from most of my co-workers, to whom I had been anchored purely by circumstance. The only person I kept in touch with was Thomas. Hed visit me occasionally, when I came home for college breaks, and wed both regress into the dumb, spiteful teenagers wed been when we first met, driving aimlessly and making grand plans, as all teenagers do, to finally Get Out Of This Place. Then, one day, I did. I graduated from college. Thomas was working seasonal service jobs and touring with his band. Wed been seeing each other less and less. Around graduation Id started coming out to my friends and family as a lesbian, my newfound revelation, but I hadnt yet told Thomas. It didnt seem worth it somehow. That first summer after my senior year of college was messy and fraught. A postgrad clich, I had no idea what I was doing with my life. For the time being, I had a job at my colleges admissions department. I was spending most weekends commuting from Connecticut to New York City to hang out with my almost-not-quite-girlfriend, whom Id met at school when we were both students, and who still had her own senior year ahead of her. One balmy summer evening, when I was stuck on my near-empty campus with nothing to do, Thomas invited me to a party. Since Warped Tour all those years ago, we had never spent time with each others friends. But he said he missed me, and hed both pick me up and drive me home, more than an hour each way. My not-quite-girlfriend and I were in the midst of a passive-aggressive text fight. I was angry and restless. After taking three shots of vodka I told Thomas to come and get me. The party was in the thickly carpeted basement of someones parents house. We had to stumble around blindly in the dark until we reached a hidden back door. Almost immediately, I didnt want to be there. His friends were drunk and leering. They saw me as the younger girl hed taken along for a cheap hookup, rather than a longtime friend. I chugged a beer in the bathroom and tried to plot my escape, but I didnt have a car and was far from home. When Thomas found me, he suggested we duck into another room where it would be quieter. I said yes, grateful. The howling hardcore music filling the basement softened as soon as we closed the door. I very clearly remember the room wed found ourselves in: spacious, with a large black couch, a jumbled, silent sound system, and a tiny kitchenette. We had everything we needed to wait out the party. I could scavenge the kitchenette for supplies, turn on a bad movie. Maybe the night could be saved. You look so beautiful, Thomas said. This was nothing out of the ordinary. He complimented me all the time, telling me how pretty and brilliant I was. I had always taken these comments as the words of someone who wasnt quite a brother, but someone like an old family friend. Sincere and warm and familiar. Innocent almost-flirting. I would never have given him the satisfaction of knowing this, but his compliments were a longtime comfort to me, especially when I had been younger and plagued with teenage insecurities. No matter my fuckups in school, no matter the ebb and flow of my boyfriends, I knew Id always have Thomas waiting in the wings, ready and willing to lift me back up. Thank you, I said. Then, somehow, we were on the black couch, and he was kissing me. In the first few moments of my surprise and discomfort, I felt the smallest glimmer of curiosity. I couldnt say Id never thought about it before. My ex-boyfriend was always suspicious of Thomas, of how he doted on me, even though I never thought Id come close to doing anything with him. But when I was younger, before I came out, it had crossed my mind once or twice. In reality, Thomas wasnt anywhere near my type. Big and broad with a slight lurch to his step and a closely cropped buzz cut, he was nothing at all like the smaller, softer boys Id always gone for, back when I still considered myself straight. I put my hand on his chest, gently pushing away from him, trying not to hurt his feelings. Im gay, I said. Thats why I broke up with my boyfriend. Im dating a girl now. Thats cool, he said, slightly breathless, before shutting off the lights and kissing me again. They were sloppy, wet kisses, fringed with a scratch of stubble. I felt revulsion beginning to seethe in my stomach, as if Id just chugged spoiled milk. Even if I had been still interested in men, this was not something I wanted. Ive thought about this for so long, he said. He was on top of me now. I tried again. I have a girlfriend. Im gay. I didnt tell you before, but Im telling you now. Weve known each other forever, he said, whispering in the dark. Youre so beautiful. Did you know that? I felt the looming presence of his friends just outside the door. I had a $5 bill in my pocket. No mode of transportation. I hadnt even told anyone back home where I was going. I dont think we should do this, I said. Acting as if he hadnt heard me, he leaned in closer and took off my clothes, gently, piece by piece. I remember him asking me if I wanted to feel good, without waiting around for my answer. I remember him draping me across the kitchenette counter like a dress out to dry. The strongest feeling I could muster, the whole time, was one of profound disappointment. He was laying waste to our friendship. That seemed to me, then, the major transgression. The most significant loss. As if our friendship was the only thing at stake. Thomas, I said at some point. I was one of very few people who called him by his full first name; everyone else perpetually shortened it. I tried, in speaking to him the way that only I spoke to him, to remind him of who I was as a person. Wed always been so honest with each other. Throughout my teenage years, when I picked my way through the thorny tangle of male attention with increasing world-worn weariness, it was only around Thomas that I felt I could knock down each and every one of my defenses. Around him, I hadnt felt like I needed to be particularly smart, or pretty, or good. I could just sit next to him in his parked car before our shifts, looking out over the Long Island Sound beyond the snack bar, soaking up the last precious moments before wed have to get up, and go inside, and get to work. The monotonous, daily shuffle of a life made better by sharing it. Thomas, I tried again, my hand on his shoulder, urging him off me, off this terrible road hed led me down. But if anything, he took my urging as further encouragement. And to quell my rising panic, I let myself fall silent at last. The path of least resistance. I dont remember when it ended but I remember that after it did, we arranged the pullout couch together. I remember being almost cheerful excited by the prospect of rest, excited to belong to my own body again. I dont remember waking up but I remember standing in the kitchenette the next morning, making a cup of Keurig coffee and watching his chest rise and fall with sleep across the room. I dont remember the drive home. When he texted me in the following days, he said hed been in love with me since the day we met. (I was practically a child when we met.) He said that hed dreamed of being with me for years. I was the smartest and most beautiful girl hed ever known. I decided to avoid, to the best of my ability, having any sort of visceral reaction to this place hed put me in. In lieu of anger, or sadness, or disgust, I opted for some bare-bones reasoning. I knew that I couldnt ever see him again (not that I wanted to). I knew if I told anyone what had happened exactly what they would call it, though I was hesitant then to claim the word. I still am, even with plenty of gender and womens studies classes under my belt. The chasm that separates what I know as a feminist, as a woman from the sticky, tangled mess of what I feel, and what I fear to feel, has gotten smaller and more manageable as the years have passed; but I still havent been able to leap over that gap entirely. At the time, I used the simplest facts at my disposal to wrap myself up in a warm, safe blanket of unfeeling and carry myself, slow and steady, all the way from point A to point B. I didnt want this, I told him. He flipped. I cant believe youre turning this special thing, one of the most important nights of my life, into something ugly. As he began, over text, to spiral out of control, I sunk deeper into a vaguely apathetic sort of peace. This time I could say no I could deny him and it would stick. But Id been denying him successfully for years before, really, without my fully knowing it. Hed made advances toward me since I was fresh out of middle school, that first season at the snack bar, when I was scared and young and lonely. He had continued to flirt with me summer after summer, in what Id thought was a playful, innocent way he would never take it too far, I thought. I trusted him not to. Heres what I hadnt realized, all those years: Ever since I first met him, Id had a string of boyfriends. I belonged to other men, and that made me untouchable. But within weeks of falling in love with a girl for the first time, I started carrying myself through the world a different way. And Thomas, perhaps, had sensed it. Hed sensed that now, more than ever before, I would never, ever want him. At best, my gayness was a factor to be pushed aside and ignored; at worst, it was a flaw in need of swift and brutal correction. But I cant pretend to know what was going through his mind. I used to think I knew so many things about him and about the kinds of men we hold dear, the ones we consider cherished exceptions to violent and careless male cruelty. He tried a few more times over the next year to get in touch with me; his texts got increasingly more bitter. Eventually, he stopped trying to reach out. He hasnt made any attempts in a long time. I saw him a couple years ago at the funeral for his uncle, who had been our boss at the snack bar and a dear, dear friend like a second father to me, and to him. All of our old co-workers were there. An awful, morbid reunion. He sat up front in the church with the rest of his family, crying openly. I didnt feel sorry for him, and I didnt forgive him, but neither did I wish him further ill will. (Perhaps this makes me a bad victim.) In an alternate universe I would have approached him after the service, leaned my head on his broad shoulder. Held his hand. In an alternate universe, wed have carried our weird, wayward friendship far into the future, like Id always thought we would. Instead, we sat many pews apart, dwelling in our private heartaches. I was scared he might turn around and look at me. I was scared that, if he did, I wouldnt feel the right things, react the right way. I was scared of the memories that began to light up, rapid-fire, in my chest, of our late boss and our work friends and our silly, desperate antics scared of the way that I still attached so much sentimentality to these years of memories, instead of retroactively earmarking them as unsalvageable. Polluted. But in the end, it didnt matter. The whole time I never saw his face. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! You are signed in as .

aS"The HBO documentary Nothing Left Unsaid delves into the long life of Gloria Vanderbilt, who was born into wealth, fame, and tragedy with her son Anderson Cooper asking the questions. View this image  Anderson Cooper and Gloria Vanderbilt. HBO The documentary Nothing Left Unsaid: Gloria Vanderbilt & Anderson Cooper takes its audience through Vanderbilts 90-plus-year life, which includes the vicious custody fight over her when she was a child in 1934 (called the trial of the century before the O.J. Simpson trial stole that moniker); the tragic deaths that have punctuated her personal history; her fraught relationship with the Vanderbilt family; and her many romances and marriages. Liz Garbus directed the documentary, which premieres on HBO on April 9, but its Anderson Cooper, Vanderbilts son, who is the on-camera interviewer. He employs his journalistic skills as his mothers loving inquisitor, prodding her about things he has never known, plus her most difficult-to-discuss subjects. Living longer than 90 years insures a fair portion of woes, but Vanderbilt has endured more than her share her father died before she could form memories of him, and another of her sons, Carter Cooper, committed suicide in 1988 when he was 23. Nothing Left Unsaid is certainly a crier. But it also imparts an equal measure of joy and laughter. (Vanderbilt and Coopers conversation continued after the filming stopped, which has turned into a newly released book, The Rainbow Comes and Goes: A Mother and Son on Life, Love, and Loss.) Nothing Left Unsaid premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January, and BuzzFeed News sat down with Cooper there, in Park City, Utah, to discuss his mothers life, and the making of the film. He also turned on his own recorder during the interview Its just a habit! he said. View this image  Carter Cooper and Vanderbilt. HBO The phrase nothing left unsaid is the articulation of an idea: Parents wont always be around to tell their stories which Cooper knows well, since his father died when he was 10. So with his mother, Cooper pressed her to tell him all the things he might not know otherwise: about her life, their family, his late father, and on difficult topics such as his brothers suicide. The aim, he said, is to avoid regrets that something was left unsaid. To discuss such things required a new language between them. Our relationship changes with our parents as they age and as we age, Cooper said. But oftentimes we dont think of new ways to talk to them, new ways to relate to them. And we get stuck in the past awkwardness, or the past anger. I think theres something very freeing about shedding that old skin, he continued. And asking those questions, and developing a new way of conversing with your parent or loved one. Anderson Cooper HBO Vanderbilt HBO When Cooper was a teenager, he began videotaping Vanderbilt: Not even asking her questions, but just videotaping, he said. Some of the footage has ended up in the documentary, including an immediately emotional opening scene on the beach, when the audience sees a young Cooper instructing his mother on how to hold the camera. I didnt remember shooting that stuff, Cooper said. It was during another home-video session, also featured in the movie, that Vanderbilt told Cooper, then in his early twenties, that its only once you accept that life is a tragedy that you can start to live. And, he said, how she envisions herself as in her core having a rock-hard diamond that nothing can get at, and nothing can scratch. View this image  Cooper, Liz Garbus, and Vanderbilt. HBO But then he realized that would not work that he would end up repeating the mythologies he already had in his head about his mother and their family. He needed, he said, a real filmmaker to look at this, because I think her story is far more interesting than even I realize. He approached Sheila Nevins, the president of HBO Documentary Films, with the idea that cable network should do a documentary about his mother; Nevins suggested Garbus, now a two-time Oscar nominee (for 1998s The Farm: Angola, USA and 2015s What Happened, Miss Simone?), who has directed a number of documentaries for HBO (including Love, Marilyn and Bobby Fischer Against the World). After Cooper watched her work, he agreed that Garbus was the best choice. And, though Cooper is an executive producer on the movie, he wants to be clear: Liz had full creative control, he said. I didnt want this to be nor did my mom, to her credit like an A&E special or a sugarcoated thing. Its not a vanity project. I wanted a film that could stand alone, and that would stand the test of time. It was Garbuss idea, Cooper said, that he be the one to interview Vanderbilt on camera. As a result, the film, as much as it is a biography of Vanderbilt, is also a deeply personal portrait of a parent and her adult son which was a surprise to Cooper. I didnt realize when we were shooting the documentary that I was going to be in it to the extent that I was, he said. That was all up to Liz to decide. I really thought it was more my moms story. But he certainly saw the advantage in Garbus idea, in terms of producing something new about Vanderbilt, who has been in the public eye for so much of her life. Cooper said, I know my mom so well that I know when shes giving a pat answer to something that shes given before, so I can easily say to her what nobody else can say to her: I know that story, youve told it a million times, whats the real deal? View this image  Vanderbilt HBO In the film, Cooper clearly revels in stories about his mothers sexual past. And during the Q&A after the docs Sundance premiere, he delightedly told a story about how his mother at age 85 described a man she was dating as the Nijinsky of cunnilingus. When reminded of his remarks at the festival, which had earned a big audience reaction, Cooper laughed: I just find it amazing! Did he remember when he began to realize that his mother had, as he put it, hooked up a lot? We would watch old movies, and I would say, Did you ever know Errol Flynn? Cooper said. And she would be, like he imitated his mothers patrician accent, Oh, yes. As a teenager, no one really wants to think about their moms sex life, he said. But certainly as an adult, my mom started telling me more stories. And through this, in the film and the book, a lot more came out. View this image  Cooper and Vanderbilt. HBO Cooper told Vanderbilt he was gay when he was 22. The conversation was, he said, something they had never even discussed. Cooper realized later that his nervousness about coming out to her, and his mothers subsequent reaction, were informed by the fact that Vanderbilts mother had been called a lesbian during the custody fight a confusing, terrifying thing for young Gloria, and a criminal act to most of the world in the 1930s. (Vanderbilt writes in The Rainbow Comes and Goes that her mother had relationships with both men and women.) She was totally cool with it, Cooper said of Vanderbilts reaction to his announcement. But there were just a couple of things she said which surprised me. One of the things she said was, Dont make any definite decisions. Which was partly based on how I phrased what I said to her. But it was just interesting to me. I realized it brought up all sorts of things from the fact that her mother was a lesbian. View this image  Wyatt Cooper and Vanderbilt; Anderson and Carter Cooper. HBO While his father had told him about his upbringing in Mississippi, and had photographs of his childhood and past, My mom had none of that, and never talked about it, he said. That the Vanderbilts were of significance to New York and American history proved to be even more confusing. My dad took me to see a statue of Cornelius Vanderbilt at Grand Central Station. I thought all grandparents turned into statues when they died because of this. It wasnt until he was a teenager, he said, that he began to read about that side of his family in history books. View this image  HBO Cooper knew there was a sadness to his mother, but hadnt before realized some of its roots: deep regret. It wasnt until the making of this film that I sort of started to hear those regrets, Cooper said. Specifically, she and her mother who had lost the embittered, public custody battle with the Vanderbilts at one point did not speak for what he estimated to be 18 years. Vanderbilt also lost touch with Dodo, her beloved nanny who had raised her, and whom Vanderbilt later hired to take care of her two older sons. Dodo died at Catholic Charities this person who had been the closest person to my mother, he said. That his mother had allowed people to slip out of her life has proven to be instructive to Cooper. I had a nurse when I was a kid growing up, a nanny, for the first 15 years of my life, who I was incredibly close to, he said. And who died just two years ago. I was there in the days before she died. I definitely learned from my mom, not having those missed connections. Nothing Left Unsaid takes it as a given that, as Vanderbilt herself puts it, her life has been a tragedy despite her accomplishments and a good amount of fun she has had over her 92 years. Cooper said that based on her contested childhood, she was burdened by the longing for something that never was, he said. And I think thats what is at the core of the sadness. As her life proceeded, devastating events added up: My brothers suicide, and my dads death, Cooper said. But he traces her initial heartache to Vanderbilts fathers death when she was 15 months old. I think it goes back to that quote from Mary Gordon, which is A fatherless girl thinks all things possible and nothing safe, he said. That is at the core of my moms existence. And I always saw that in her eyes. I mean, I could always see that slight melancholy, slight sadness. Like a shadow passing by in her eyes. And yet, he said: She has great joy, and is the most optimistic person who thinks great love is right around the corner at 92. I mean, literally believes this. And I believe it too for her, because nothing would surprise me with my mom. CNN Ive grown up in complete reaction to that, and am a complete catastrophist and believe the worst is about to occur at any second, he said. And Cooper, who has reported from dozens of war zones, means literal catastrophes. Like, I want to have a stockpile of food in my basement, he said. If a bomb went off here right now, I have the number for CNN for where to call in to start reporting. I want to be prepared for any eventuality. And Im so egotistical that I believe that I would somehow survive the bomb blast, so I would continue to report. View this image  Anderson (left) and Carter Cooper. HBO They seem to handle their fame similarly: by pretending its not there. I think celebrity is like gangrene, Cooper said. You have to watch the spread of it or it will infect your entire body. And it gives you this sense of entitlement that is sick, and totally antithetical to being a reporter. So theres no good that can come of thinking about yourself in that way. Honestly, people come up to me on the street all the time and say hi, and I say hi, and I just pretend that they know me somehow, he continued. Or maybe I know them. I have such a bad memory, I very well may know them, so I greet everybody with equal enthusiasm! As for Vanderbilts daily life, Cooper thinks the reason no one had thought to make a documentary about her is that they dont know about her private world. People probably imagine she lives this glamorous life of going to parties and having lunches with ladies and stuff, he said. She hasnt done that stuff in my entire lifetime. She has recently discovered Judge Judy, he said; and even more recently, Dr. Phil. She works all day long in her studio, painting or drawing.
