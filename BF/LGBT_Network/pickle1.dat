S"As soon as I said Safe Schools, you could see it in their faces. View this image  Lane Sainty / BuzzFeed A student welfare support worker in a regional area of Australia told BuzzFeed News she had struggled to explain the anti-bullying program to parents after an effective campaign led by conservative media, politicians and lobby groups left the name of the program in the mud. Theyre just scared of what they dont understand, she said. As soon as I said Safe Schools, you could see it in their faces. We dont want our kids indoctrinated. Trying to deal with a lack of understanding and support, several LGBTI students have dropped out of the high school she works in. Weve lost three, one trans student and two same-sex attracted students in the last 18 months because of bullying and misunderstanding in the school, the welfare worker said. One student who left the school was so distressed by the negative media that his mother was also referred to a psychologist as she struggled to support him. He believes the things he hears he says Im a freak, nobody wants me, the student welfare worker said. Hes attempted suicide several times in the past few years. View this image  Safe Schools Coalition A government review into Safe Schools earlier this year dictated schools must get the permission of individual parents and also of the relevant parenting body before the program can be introduced. The requirement was slammed at the time by the parents of transgender children, who must now effectively beg school parenting bodies before their children can receive help. BuzzFeed News understands some schools have privately expressed fear over being publicly identified as a member of the program. In Queensland and NSW, the list of member schools has been removed from public listings due to safety concerns for staff and students. Safe Schools declined to comment on the difficulties experienced in rolling out the program since the review. View this image  Adam Marsters / NEWZULU Last week, NSW MP Damian Tudehope presented a petition of more than 17,000 signatures, largely from the Chinese-Australian community, to state parliament calling for the program to be shut down. Labor MP Penny Sharpe, who has started a counter-petition, told BuzzFeed News the information provided around Tudehopes petition was inaccurate. Sharpe has received several thousand emails about the program, many of which are riddled with errors. One form email incorrectly claims Safe Schools advertises chest-binding and teaches children how gay and lesbian people have sex. Sharpe described it as a gross misconception of the program: Please stop Safe Schools advertising the harmful practice of chest binding on their websites. Please stop Safe Schools encouraging students to cross-dress. Please stop Safe Schools teaching kids gay and lesbian sexual techniques. Please stop Safe Schools encouraging kids to use either boys or girls toilets. Please stop Safe Schools trying to integrate gender theory and sexual themes across all subjects. Others describe Safe Schools as social engineering to make kids gay and transgender, and warn Sharpe to act wisely in fear and honour of God. Ive talked to teachers and students and parents whose kids are involved in schools where Safe Schools is operating and they remain distraught its become a political football, Sharpe said. Whats been lost is that its made an incredibly positive difference in the lives of many students. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"The most hateful debate in history. View this image  Torsten Blackwood / AFP / Getty Images Submissions by gay activists to the UN Human Rights Committee throughout the early 90s, provided to BuzzFeed News, show a debate characterised by acrimony and a desire to dehumanise and humiliate LGBT people. Politicians and councillors described gay people as no better than Saddam Hussein, said they sullied society with their evil activities, and encouraged people to call gay men the derogatory term poofs. Government ministers, including prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, have repeatedly said they believe the national debate over marriage equality that a plebiscite would bring will be respectful. Speaking to Lateline on Monday night, attorney-general George Brandis said Australia is well placed to conduct a national conversation about marriage. Ive got enough confidence in the Australian people to believe that it will be a respectful discussion. However, LGBT Australians with memories of Tasmania have serious doubts. Prominent activist and former head of Australian Marriage Equality, Rodney Croome, told BuzzFeed News Tasmania was host to the most protracted and hateful LGBT rights debate in Australian history. View this image  Lukas Coch / AAPIMAGE Tasmanian senator Eric Abetz was first elected in 1994, the same year that the UN found Tasmanias anti-gay laws breached Australias international human rights obligations. In a speech to parliament at the time, Abetz stated his opposition to the proposed decriminalisation of homosexuality, saying it could lead to inadvertently legalising incest, and that the UN should not dictate Tasmanias moral standards. The question arises: who is best suited to determine the moral code of Tasmanians? Abetz asked the parliament. Is it the champagne charlies of the United Nations? Is it the unelected people on the Human Rights Commission or ought it be the people of Tasmania? I declare unashamedly my commitment and bias towards democracy as opposed to the thought police of the United Nations. If we are going to rely on this overriding right to privacy, surely incest must be allowed as well, he said. A spokesperson for Abetz told BuzzFeed News he would not comment on the 1997 debate. View this image  Graham Denholm / Getty Images A plethora of comments made by state and local politicians in the late 80s and early 90s show gay people were openly derided and threatened with violence as part of the legislative struggle. In 1988, then-Tasmanian premier Robin Gray said Aboriginal people, the sick and Greenies were welcome in Tasmania, but homosexuals were not interested in. In November 1989, MLC Richard Archer said when I hear a minister of the Crown making reference to the decriminalisation of homosexuality I feel sick in the guts - when I hear these people [homosexuals] talking about human rights, my blood boils. Ulverstone councillor Jack Breheny said in 1991 that representatives of the gay community are no better than Saddam Hussein and convicted murderer Dr Rory Jack Thompson. In 1991, MLC George Brookes suggested to the parliament that laws against homosexuality should be made more draconian in order to convince people to take the plane north. Do not let them sully our state with their evil activities, he added. Brookes also encouraged Tasmanians to call people poofter instead of gay. MLC Hugh Hiscutt commented not a bad idea either in response to gay people being put to death in the times of the Old Testament. View this image  Star Observer / Via starobserver.com.au In 1997, Tasmania became the last Australian state to decriminalise consenting sex between men. Croome said the lesson he learned from that long debate is that a marriage equality plebiscite would not be respectful. When I say the plebiscite will be a platform for hate and young people will lose their lives, its not rhetoric, it comes straight from my personal experience, he said. Last week, many people shared a Facebook post from comedian Hannah Gadsby, in which she detailed her experience of being a gay teenager in Tasmania in the 90s. The things that were said led her to hate myself so deeply, she wrote. Her sentiments are reflected among the wider LGBT community, with recent polling finding 85% of LGBT people oppose the plebiscite. Among LGBT Tasmanians, the number is even higher: 92%. Many would rather wait years for equality than sit through another debate of that scale. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS'Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton joined by 12 others states officials on Wednesday urged a federal judge in North Carolina to put challenges to that states anti-transgender law on hold for now. View this image  Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton Kirk Irwin / Getty Images WASHINGTON Texas and 12 other states injected themselves on Wednesday into the ongoing legal battles over North Carolinas anti-LGBT law by asking a federal judge to put those lawsuits on hold for now. The law, HB 2, was passed earlier this year, and one of the provisions the subject of several lawsuits limits public restroom usage to peoples biological sex, using a definition that targets transgender people unable to get their birth certificate changed to reflect their gender identity. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, joined by 10 other state attorneys general and two governors, specifically asked U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Schroeder to put the Justice Departments pending challenge to that law on hold while other cases proceed. The Obama administration has asked Schroeder to halt enforcement of the anti-transgender provision, and he heard arguments over that request on Aug. 1. Putting the cases on hold as Paxton and the other states officials asked in the unusual filing on Wednesday (or denying the Obama administrations request, a move the brief also supports) would mean that the anti-transgender law would remain in effect for the time being. Paxton and the state officials cite an injunction issued in the case that Texas and several other states brought against the Obama administrations pro-transgender policies as a key reason for judge in North Carolina to issue a stay in that case despite the fact that the injunction issued in the Texas case specifically exempted previously initiated litigation from that order. The legal fight that has erupted over transgender restroom usage in the past few years has, generally, taken three forms of cases: those filed by individuals challenging anti-transgender policies; those filed by states or state officials challenging the Obama administrations position that existing civil rights laws protect transgender people from discrimination; and those filed by the federal government challenging anti-transgender actions, policies, or laws. U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Schroeder, hearing several of the many challenges to the North Carolina law, issued a narrow injunction this past week in a case brought by students and employees of the University of North Carolina against the state and university. In the injunction, he ordered the school and government not to enforce the part of HB 2 that limits public restroom usage to peoples biological sex but only as to the people who brought the lawsuit. A big part of Schroeders decision was based on a prior decision of the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals where appeals from federal courts in North Carolina are heard holding that the Obama administrations interpretation that Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 protects transgender people from discrimination is a permissible interpretation of the regulations implementing that law. The school district in that case Gloucester County School Board v. G.G. currently is seeking Supreme Court review of the 4th Circuits decision. Schroeder has not, however, yet ruled on the more broad request by the Justice Department to halt all enforcement of that anti-transgender provision in HB 2. The move by Paxton and the other state officials on Wednesday of asking to file a brief before Schroeders court opposing the Obama administrations request was unusual because it came nearly a month after Schroeder held arguments in the matter. Paxton was joined on the brief by the attorneys general of Arkansas, Arizona, West Virginia, Alabama, Wisconsin, Georgia, Nebraska, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Utah as well as the governors of Kentucky and Mississippi. While ostensibly an opposition to the Justice Departments request for an injunction, the brief also was unusual because the state officials used it to urge Schroeder to put the North Carolina cases on hold pressing the arguments that prevailed in front of the judge in Texas before Schroeder in North Carolina and arguing to Schroeder that the injunction should influence what he does next in the cases before him. While the Injunction [in the Texas case] does not specifically prevent DOJ from continuing this litigation, the state officials note, and this Court has acknowledged the same referencing Schroeders order from this past week it nonetheless supports staying these proceedings until the Supreme Court decides whether to hear the appeal of the Gloucester case and until the 4th Circuit addresses an appeal of Schroeders injunction regarding the individual plaintiffs and UNC. Additionally, Paxton and the other state officials argue that the injunction in the Texas-led federal challenge supports denying the [injunction] requested by the Justice Department. Indeed, now that the federal policies at issue are subject to a nationwide injunction, will be inspected again by the Fourth Circuit, and also scrutinized by the Supreme Court, granting the United States preliminary injunction motion would bestow upon North Carolina the distinction of making it the only State unable to enforce its policy regarding access to intimate areas, the brief argues. The same group of state officials sought to file a brief in one other case on Wednesday, supporting the Highland Local School Districts school board in Ohio in its request for a preliminary injunction against the Education Department.

aS"Polish Instagrammer Luxy says he was stopped at Doha airport due to issues with his visa and then detained in a jail for two months over accusations that he was gay. View this image  View this image  Luxy told Gay Star News that he was held by security at Doha airport on July 6 due to issues with his visa. He said that while he was detained, officials looked through his phone and then arrested him for indecency, cybercrime, and allegations of being gay. The Instagram star does not identify as gay. View on Instagram View on Instagram View on Instagram View on Instagram He said he believes the Qataris did not relay news of his arrest back to his home country. After eventually being located, he said, he was given a lawyer and then released. However, the Polish embassy in Doha told BuzzFeed News that Luxy was not arrested on charges of being gay and that he was never reported as missing. The embassy also said that when interviewed by Polish consular staff in prison, Luxy never complained about the conduct of police officers and he felt the conditions of his arrest were fair. Their full statement is below: A Polish national nicknamed Luxy, aged 18, was detained at Hamad International Airport in Doha on 06 July 2016 on a charge of money extortion, blackmail and assault on a Qatari nationals privacy on line (cyber-related offense) not of being homosexual or due to a minor visa irregularities. His arrest has not been reported to the Polish consular services by the Qatari Police (which is by and large a standard practice in Qatar), until the detainees family information received a week after the actual detention. Polish consular service has never reported Mr Luxy missing. I visited the detainee in jail (remand over Criminal Investigation Department, not a prison) several times and found the arrest conditions decent and correct, what was also the opinion of the detainee. No irregular behaviour of any Police officer was reported to me by the detainee. Eventually Luxy was released in mid-August on bail and allowed to leave Qatar national territory although, to my knowledge, the investigation is still underway.

aS"Federal officials will not say if they will continue to investigate complaints from transgender workers while an Aug. 21 injunction is in place. On Tuesday, the Justice Department asked the court for some clarity on that injunction. View this image  Attorney General Loretta Lynch AP / Manuel Balce Ceneta On August 21, a federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked the federal government from enforcing guidance and rules based on Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 that protect transgender students in public schools. That decision did not go as far as Texas and 11 other states behind the lawsuit wanted. They had requested a preliminary injunction that also would suspend policies and guidance under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that protect transgender workers. But the judges order didnt mention Title VII or workers just Title IX and schools. That might seem to settle the matter: The government cannot enforce its guidance in schools or in litigation resulting from that school guidance, the thinking goes, but it could enforce its rules when a transgender employee alleges discrimination in a workplace. But now, more than a week since US District Court Judge Reed OConnor issued his order, there is growing uncertainty about how the federal government will proceed. At the heart of the problem, according to Ezra Young, a staff attorney at the Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund (TLDEF), is that the language in Judge OConnors injunction could be read fairly broadly. It unclear as to which laws and agencies it attempts to enjoin enforcement of, Young told BuzzFeed News. We believe clarification is needed. For example, OConnor writes that the injunction shall be binding on Defendants and the defendants include agencies that deal with employment, such as the Department of Labor and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In addition, OConnors order bans the agencies from asserting the guidelines carry weight in court in cases initiated after his order, but Young said it is unclear if those guidelines concern only policies in schools or also in workplaces. Young said early Tuesday that he expected government lawyers to ask the court for clarification as to which defendants are enjoined and which issues are covered by injunction whether it is just Title IX or whether it goes further than Title IX. On Tuesday evening, the Justice Department did file a file a notice asking for clarification, but only insofar as to ask OConnor to make it clear beyond any doubt that they are free to proceed with a list of cases that the department determined are related to, but distinct from, the Texas litigation. Detailing its view of the limits set by OConnor in the injunction, Justice Department lawyers then state that they believe that the cases listed fall outside the scope of these prohibitions meaning that the department believes it should be free to continue litigating those cases. On the larger question of the injunction itself, the Justice Department added in Tuesday nights filing that it expect[s] to file a motion seeking relief with respect to the Courts preliminary injunction. It did not, however, give any timeline as to when it will do so. BuzzFeed News earlier had asked the Department of Justice and EEOC, which oversees enforcement of civil rights law in workplaces, whether they would continue to investigate complaints from transgender workers and enforce their interpretation of Title VII. The Justice Department did not answer the question, and the question of investigating new potential cases was not addressed in Tuesdays filing. A spokesperson for the EEOC, Kimberly Smith-Brown, did respond, but only said that the agency is currently reviewing the [judges] order and assessing its implications. That evasion is at odds from the EEOCs outspoken positions over the past several years. It first found that Title VIIs ban on sex discrimination prohibits transgender discrimination in 2012, then later expanded that specifically to include such things as restroom usage. But Paul Castillo, a lawyer for Lambda Legal, which had filed a brief in the case supporting the transgender protections, told BuzzFeed News that his view of OConnors order is that the agencies can still enforce rules for transgender workers. The judges order doesnt stop them from investigating and and processing complaints under Title VII, he said, adding that the EEOC can continue business as usual. The Texas Attorney Generals Office, asked about the scope of the judges order, also said it only directly concerns schools, governed by Title IX. This order does not address Title VII, said spokesperson Kayleigh Lovvorn. There could, however, be an effect on workplace cases, she said, because courts consider case law interpreting Title IX when evaluating a case concerning Title VII. Thus, the injunction will impact Title VII adjudications. The EEOC has been at the legal vanguard to argue that existing civil rights law protects transgender people. In the past four years, it has accepted complaints and filed litigation against employers that it found discriminated on the basis of gender identity. And in 2014, then-Attorney General Eric Holder said the Justice Department would maintain the same position in its litigation. If the EEOC is halting that work for now, the impact could affect cases between two private parties not just those cases that rely on government participation. This is why: Before a worker can sue an employer under federal civil rights law, the agency details, he or she must first file a complaint with the EEOC and obtain a Notice-of-Right-to-Sue letter. Asked if the EEOC would continue, in the wake of the Texas court ruling, to accept complaints and issue right-to-sue letters to workers alleging gender-identity discrimination so those workers could pursue lawsuits on their own, Smith-Brown did not comment. Young, the TLDEF attorney, said, Our understanding is that the EEOC, like the other defendants in the litigation, is seeking clarification on what the injunction means. That is very likely why they are declining to answer questions about the right-to-sue letter. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

Lauras always talked about her overprotective dad and you get to see that and peer into the telescope of her growing-up life, Bauman told BuzzFeed.

Three is being treated like a Shakespeare play with three acts, so a big chunk of episodes will be released in three parts. Act I will drop Sept. 15, followed by Act II on Sept. 29 and the final act will be released on Oct. 13. Theyll always show up on the KindaTV YouTube channel. View this image  Carmilla has always featured LGBT characters and romance, but the show doesnt make a big deal about it. But this season thats changing. Its always been the normalcy in the school, which is so fantastic, but this year its really talked about, said Bauman. Like, theyre actually going to use the word lesbian. (!!) Now were really unabashedly a queer show, said Negovanlis. On the way to day one! @carmillaseries #letslafongo I love LaFs storyline this year, its one of my fave parts of the season, said Bauman. We really get a deeper understanding of why they are the way they are and their own journey in the world. Its really neat to see this [non-binary] character be super amazing and heroic, added Negovanlis. In fact, they said were going to get a deeper look at all the characters, so expect some emotional screentime with all your faves.

Its always been talked about in reference but you get to experience it as a viewer, said Bauman. View this image  We did learn how to fight, said Negovanlis.

Theres a rollercoaster of emotions we can expect to go through this year, said Negovanlis. As you can imagine, being stuck with your ex in a small space can bring out a lot of feelings. There was definitely a lot of epic crazy stuff that happened at the end of Season 2 and a lot of betrayal and trust lost, said Bauman. Season 1 was all about falling deeply in love all of a sudden, and then Season 2 was about what happens when you see things you dont like about the other person, she added. Season 3 is about accepting the person and its just about a deeper level of love I think. View this image  My conclusion is: . See you on Sept. 15, Creampuffs!

aS"I feel like I cant speak up for myself anymore. View this image  Ema O'Connor / BuzzFeed HOUSTON Many LGBT students at the University of Houston say they feel like they can no longer express themselves safely now that a law allowing people to carry concealed weapons on campus is in effect and classes have begun.I feel like I cant speak up for myself anymore, Robyn Foley, 22, a transgender and intersex student who majors in anthropology, told BuzzFeed News. I cant correct someone on my pronouns Robyns pronoun is they I cant stand up for my transgender friends, because if I do and someone gets pissed off all they have to do is pull out a gun. A number of other students eating lunch at the campus LGBTQ Resource Center nodded in agreement. School stresses us out enough without us having to worry about the people who already yell at us for being sinners, added Michael Allen, 29, an arts major with green hair. On Aug. 1, just before the start of classes at the state school, Senate Bill 11 known as the campus carry law went into effect, allowing students at state universities in Texas who have licenses to carry concealed handguns to bring those guns anywhere on campus, with the exception of exclusion zones. These zones include the majority of dorms though some rooms in the dorms are not exclusion zones as well as some research centers and other buildings containing classrooms, and any religious centers, day care centers, and health centers. The building containing the LGBT center, as well as the veteran students center, is not an exclusion zone, which many of the students in the LGBT center didnt realize until someone looked it up during a conversation with BuzzFeed News. The students sat in stunned silence for a moment before Foley said, Wow, I just assumed it was, out of common sense. Thats actually really scary, another student, who went by K, added. (K asked not to have their full name included because they havent yet told their parents about their gender identity.) Guns must remain concealed at all times, but Allen told BuzzFeed News he had already seen a man with a gun visible on his belt in the parking lot. Some students said that the fact that the guns cant be seen makes it even more intimidating. Anyone you get into a philosophical argument with in class might have his hand on his gun while youre talking, one student, who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation, told BuzzFeed News. I already feel it affecting my education. Ema O'Connor / BuzzFeed Robyn Foley, left, and Michael Allen at the University of Houstons LGBT Resource Center. Some of the students thought about protesting, but they didnt think it would be safe. We would also out ourselves in the process, which isnt safe for many of the LGBT students on campus, Foley added. Especially now. Last week, students at the University of Texas at Austin held a large protest against the campus carry laws. Hundreds of students waved dildos and held signs reading Cocks Not Glocks. So far no protests have occurred on UHs campus. K added that when the law was passed last year, the administration promised to provide resources to increase a feeling of safety on campus such as areas for people to check their weapons before going into the exclusion zones. I havent seen a single one of those yet, they said. Elizabeth Gregory, the director of UHs gender and sexuality studies department, told BuzzFeed News that many faculty members shes spoken with have been concerned about how campus carry will affect class discussions, particularly in her department, where many of the subjects covered in their classes are controversial to begin with. The whole point of being at university is being able to speak your mind, she said. This dampens that because people never know what the person next to them might be thinking about what they are saying. She added that she and her department have had discussions about taking action, though no specific plans have taken shape. She believes this is mainly because UHs campus community is less tight-knit than UT Austins. I think the community was hoping there would be some reason [campus carry] would be taken off the table, Gregory said. Now we have to come to terms with it as a reality. Ethan in the University of Houston Student Center North. Ema O'Connor / BuzzFeed University of Houston Student Center North Ema O'Connor / BuzzFeed Many of the LGBTQ students told BuzzFeed News they regularly experienced intimidation on campus before the law was implemented both from fellow students and from non-student religious protest groups on campus, which the students refer to as Hell Yellers. Many non-student religious groups, including one called Bulldog Ministries, show up on UHs campus during midterms and finals and yell at students, the students at the LGBT center told BuzzFeed News.On Bulldogs website, men can be seen in various locations in Houston holding signs reading, WARNING: drunks, homosexuals, abortionists, adulterers, liars, fornicators, thieves, atheists, witches, idolaters, HELL AWAITS YOU. Because of UHs freedom of expression policy, the group is allowed to remain in certain areas on campus as long as they dont physically assault anyone. But Allen and Foley said they have watched the groups push people protesting their protests. Bulldog didnt immediately return a request for comment. Allen said he was more worried about these groups being able to carry guns on campus than he is about UHs students. These people come here with the purpose of spreading hate, they come here looking for conflict, Allen said. Thats what worries me really. Neither the UH administration nor the UH police press office immediately responded to BuzzFeed News request for comment. View this image  The University of Houstons LGBTQ, Women and Gender Resource Center. Ema O'Connor / BuzzFeed Ethan, 19, a trans student who identifies as male, told BuzzFeed News that before the campus carry law he was already worried about using the mens bathroom and having someone say, You dont look right, you dont belong here. Now those people might have guns, he added. Foley said they have had slurs yelled at them and been intimidated on campus before. Other LGBT students said they have had similar experiences. Many of the students said that despite not wanting the guns on campus, they were comfortable around guns, or even loved them. I grew up around guns, Ethan said. My parents had them for protection. But having them in a college environment was just different, he said. Foley said that they also grew up around guns, and that their boyfriend of nearly five years keeps a gun on their beside table every night. But this doesnt stop Foley from fearing the actions of their peers. But the good thing is, maybe this will make our campus start paying more attention to local politics, Allen said. Maybe this campus will actually start voting. 5. Texas House Passes Bill Allowing Concealed Guns Inside Colleges buzzfeed.com  Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"Please dont hector me. Anglican priest Ian Powell approached Shorten outside a church service for MPs this morning in Canberra, saying he liked the Labor party but was disappointed by Shortens comments. ABC News posted footage of the awkward interaction on Twitter. OL @billshortenmp bailed up by a priest over his views on gay marriage. Latest on the blog https://t.co/Z0b17shjXR https://t.co/hj32e2RmJ5 Powell: You described people who werent in favour of changing the definition of marriage as haters who come out from under rocks. Can I ask you not to speak like that? Because I know lots of people like that. Shorten: I dont mean to interrupt you youre asking me Powell: Please dont speak like that abut other Australians so we can have a civil and tolerant discussion rather than the hate speech coming from our prospective prime minister. Shorten: If youre going to quote me, quote me accurately. Powell: Well thats how you were quoted. Tell me what you said then, Ill be glad if I was wrong. Shorten: Please dont hector me. Give me the chance to speak. Powell: Go, go go. Shorten: Thank you for that. First of all, people of faith can be opposed to marriage equality. Powell: Its not about faith. Its just a point of view. Shorten: If youve got more to say Ill listen to you. Powell: Thank you. Shorten: People of faith can be opposed to marriage equality but some people who object to marriage equality do have homophobic attitudes. Powell: Of course. Thank you. Powell was referencing comments made by Shorten in a debate prior to the election. The context of the haters who come out from under rocks quote is Shorten saying the marriage plebiscite could fuel homophobia. I dont want to give the haters a chance to come out from underneath the rock and make life harder for LGBTI people or their families, to somehow question the legitimacy of their relationship, Shorten said at the time. Powell slammed Shorten as taking cheap, nasty, untruthful shots instead of modeling intelligent, respectful tolerance. Of course there are haters on both sides, he told reporters. In a 2012 lecture on homosexuality and Christianity, Powell likened being gay to having a strong attraction to animals. Ive met people whose deep innate longings is to have sex with animals. They struggle. This guy I was talking to he felt it deeply as any other sexual longing. As much as I wanted to have sex with women, he wanted to have sex with animals. Thats just the way he found himself. Why does he not do it? He understands that that is not what the Bible says. Powell also said the term homosexual is unhelpful, offering same-sex attracted and same-sex attraction activity and lifestyle as better ways to discuss homosexuality. SSA is a non judgmental thing, they are attracted to people of the same sex, he said. [SSAAL] is a different thing, people who say Yes I am attracted to the same sex and I will act on that and it will become part of my lifestyle. In comments on Facebook last year, Powell also argued that same-sex marriage would lead to group marriages. I am happy to have a large bet that once we do redefine it then very soon we will have all sorts of pushes to redefine the redefinition that will be impossible to ignore, he wrote.

aS"The Gloucester County School Board is asking the justices to reverse a lower court decision in favor of a transgender student. View this image  Mandel Ngan / AFP / Getty Images WASHINGTON The Virginia school district seeking to limit restroom use to peoples biological sex effectively barring transgender students from using the restroom that corresponds with their gender identity on Monday asked the US Supreme Court to hear its appeal. The Gloucester County School Board asked the high court to take the case and reverse an appeals court decision that sided with a transgender student and the Obama administration. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court issued an order allowing the school to keep its policy in place while the justices decide whether to hear the appeal. If the justices agree to hear the appeal, per the earlier order, the courts order allowing the policy to stay in place will remain in effect until the justices reach a decision in the case. The student, Gavin Grimm, is represented by the ACLU. The Obama administration, through interpretation of existing laws and regulations, has determined that the sex discrimination ban in Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 includes a ban on anti-transgender discrimination. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals held that the administrations interpretation was a permissible interpretation, leading the district court in Grimms case to issue an injunction against Gloucester schools. The Supreme Courts order, however, stayed that injunction for the time being meaning Grimm, and any other transgender student, could not use the restroom that accords with their gender identity. The lawyers for the school district frame the case as one not about transgender rights, but rather one about agency behavior in setting policies such as the Title IX interpretation advanced by the Obama administration. [T]his case is not really about whether G.G. should be allowed to access the boys restrooms, nor even primarily about whether Title IX can be interpreted to require recipients to allow transgender students into the restrooms and locker rooms that accord with their gender identity, the school boards lawyers write. Fundamentally, this case is about whether an agency employee can impose that policy in a piece of private correspondence. In addition to the Virginia lawyers from Harman, Claytor, Corrigan & Wellman which has been representing the school district the legal team representing Gloucester schools now has expanded to include some of the leading national lawyers fighting the administrations pro-transgender policies. Kyle Duncan is listed as the counsel of record in the case, and he is joined on the brief by his law partner, Gene Schaerr, as well as St. Louis lawyers from the James Otis Law Group, Jonathan Mitchell and D. John Sauer. Once briefs are filed responding to the school boards Monday filing, the justices generally schedule a private vote on whether to hear the case. The current composition of the Supreme Court it has operated with only eight justices since Antonin Scalias death in February could become a key factor in what happens next with the case. It takes four justices to grant the certiorari petition and hear an appeal. It takes five votes, however, to reach a majority opinion. If the court accepted the case, and split down ideological grounds 44, the lower courts decision in favor of Grimm and the administration would be left in place but no national precedent would be set by the case.

aS"A narrow ruling granting a preliminary injunction to those who sued after passage of North Carolinas HB 2. View this image  A unisex sign and the We Are Not This slogan are outside a bathroom at Bull McCabes Irish Pub on May 10, 2016 in Durham, North Carolina. Sara D. Davis / Getty Images In a limited ruling on Friday afternoon, a federal judge barred the University of North Carolina from enforcing the bathroom bill provision of the states anti-LGBT HB 2 law against those transgender individuals who sued the state following the passage of the law. In the ruling U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Schroeder noted, Ultimately, the record reflects what counsel for Governor [Pat] McCrory candidly speculates was the status quo ante in North Carolina in recent years: some transgender individuals have been quietly using bathrooms and other facilities that match their gender identity, without public awareness or incident. The case was brought by the ACLU and Lambda Legal on behalf of several North Carolina residents, including professors and students at UNC schools. After reviewing the record in the case and relevant case law, Schroeder concluded a preliminary injunction of part of the law was appropriate. Specifically, he pointed to a case (G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board) in which the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals from which appeals from North Carolina are heard held that the Obama administrations interpretation of Title IXs sex discrimination provision as including anti-transgender discrimination was permitted. Part Is wholesale ban on access to facilities is inconsistent with DOEs guidance on Title IX compliance under G.G., Schroeder concluded. Accordingly, the court will enjoin UNC from enforcing Part I against the individual transgender Plaintiffs until the court reaches a final decision on the merits in this case, Schroeder concluded. He ruled that plaintiffs did not make the same case that they were likely to succeed on an equal protection challenge to the law and did not rule at this time on their due process-related claim. Finally, he also noted that this injunction returns the parties to the status quo ante as it existed in Title IX facilities prior to Part I [of HB 2]s passage in March 2016.

aS'Jay Timmons and Rick Olson thought theyd have no legal trouble using a surrogate to birth their son. Then a rogue judge in Wisconsin pulled them into an 11-month legal battle. View this image  Jay Timmons (left) and Rick Olson (right) with their three children. Courtesy Jay Timmons and Rick Olson Jay Timmons and Rick Olson, a married gay couple from Virginia, didnt think theyd have any trouble becoming the legal parents of the baby boy their surrogate, a Wisconsin woman, delivered for them last year. They had gotten the frozen embryo that became their son as a gift from straight friends whose in vitro fertilization created more embryos than they could use. They had chosen a Wisconsin surrogate specifically because the states Supreme Court had upheld surrogacy, and other same-sex couples had had smooth sailing there. And by just about any measure, the two intended fathers were prime parent material: They both had good jobs, they had been together for 25 years, and they were already raising two daughters from previous surrogacies. But their careful plans went awry the month before their son, Jacob, was born, when their effort to be named his legal parents landed before a conservative judge who saw surrogacy as a form of human trafficking. Over the next 11 months, the couples bizarre legal battle cost more than $400,000 and kept them in constant terror of losing their son. We didnt have one nights peace, Timmons, 54, a conservative Christian and president of the National Association of Manufacturers, told BuzzFeed News. Wed wake up absolutely panicked, around 2 in the morning, and talk about the fact that we didnt know what was going to happen. The couple took out second and third mortgages to cover the legal fees, and Olson, 49, quit his job as a federal lobbyist for Capital One to manage the proceedings. Over the last couple of years, a handful of high-profile surrogacy lawsuits have cropped up in U.S. courts. In California, a surrogate named Melissa Cook refused a mans wishes to abort one of the triplets she was carrying for him. And in a Pennsylvania, The View co-host Sherri Shepherd tried, unsuccessfully, to pull out of a contract with a pregnant surrogate after splitting up with her husband. But the Wisconsin case is likely unprecedented, legal experts say, in that the surrogate, her husband, and the intended parents were all happy with their arrangement. Only the judge was not. The case was a judicial hijacking, Melissa Brisman, a surrogacy lawyer in New Jersey, told BuzzFeed News. Were at a time when a lot of people are still very committed to the idea that family values means straight married couples who have sex are the only ones who should have babies. In June the couple won the case, thanks in large part to the judges abrupt resignation. Although the proceedings had played out in closed court, once it was over, supporters of Timmons and Olson provided copies of court transcripts, briefs, and filings to BuzzFeed News. And although the case is certainly an anomaly among the thousands of surrogacy arrangements made in the US every year, it underscores how, in certain areas of the country, surrogacy has become a flashpoint for cultural debates about same-sex marriage, reproductive rights, and the booming fertility industry. Dane County Circuit Court Judge Jim Troupis, appointed by Gov. Scott Walker last year, opened his March opinion with the statement, Human trafficking comes in many forms. And although he went on to describe the two dads as a spectacular set of parents who would raise the child in a nurturing environment with unmatched financial resources, he made it clear that he was bothered by the fact that the couple had paid a woman to carry a baby who was not related to them. The fundamental fact remains that another couple has provided the child as a gift to the petitioners, and the child has no genetic relationship to the petitioners, Troupis wrote. In order to bring the child into world, the petitioners have paid a significant amount of money. Without those payments there would be no child. Surrogacy is unquestionably expensive: Even before they ran into trouble and began accruing bills from a dozen different lawyers, the Virginia men paid $35,000 to their surrogate and another $12,500 to the Wisconsin agency that arranged their contract. Some people see these arrangements as selling babies, or exploiting poor womens bodies. But others, including many feminists, say women should be able to use their bodies as they please. There is no federal law on the subject, and state laws vary enormously. California, for example, where Timmons and Olson hired the surrogates who delivered their two daughters, is the center of the nations surrogacy industry, thanks to a friendly state law. But most states dont have any surrogacy laws on the books. Some simply refuse to enforce surrogacy contracts. Others, including Virginia, dont allow surrogacy unless at least one of the intended parents has a genetic connection to the baby. New York and Washington allow only unpaid, or altruistic surrogacy, and Michigan has criminal penalties for all types. Were not getting any closer to a national consensus on the subject, Naomi Cahn, a family law professor at the George Washington University Law School, told BuzzFeed News. And its not just a split between red states banning it and blue states supporting it. Despite the legal limbo, because of the rise of in vitro fertilization now responsible for nearly 2% of US births and the legalization of same-sex marriage, demand is also rising for surrogates. And, partly to avoid legal snags, these women are generally gestational surrogates, meaning that they carry embryos that are not genetically related to them. According to the CDC, there were 3,432 gestational surrogates in 2013, up from 727 in 1999. View this image  A petri dish containing an embryo at the IVF lab at New York Universitys Langone Fertility Center. Jared Harrell for BuzzFeed News Timmons and Olson say they were not thinking much about adding to their family until their friends asked if they wanted their two leftover frozen embryos (only one of which survived). The California surrogacy agency that had helped the two men get their daughters was no longer in business. So they researched the various state laws and chose Wisconsin because it allowed same-sex marriage and had a state Supreme Court ruling upholding surrogacy contracts where they are in the best interests of the child. The Wisconsin proceedings started smoothly. Their agency, Pink and Blue Surrogacy and Fertility of Waterloo, found them a surrogate. And before Jacob was born, Judge Sarah OBrien, who was filling in to cover a vacancy on the county court, issued an interim order giving them parental rights, which would become permanent once the baby was born and had a birth certificate. Jacob was born Aug. 17, 2015, but by that time, the case had been transferred to Judge Troupis, who had recently been appointed to the court. He nixed Judge OBriens order, and appointed an independent lawyer to represent Jacobs interests in the proceedings. Although the case was in Dane County, the liberal stronghold that contains Madison, Judge Troupis appointed as the childs legal guardian Mark Knutson, a lawyer 70 miles away whose radio broadcast, The Word on The Law, aims to reconcile Gods word with the law. Knutson, in turn, brought in another lawyer from his firm, Erik Krueger, who had worked with Liberty Counsel, a group that defends public officials like Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Timmons and Olson were for the most part allowed to keep Jacob at their home in Virginia, although at one point, Timmons had to stay in Wisconsin with Jacob while Olson and the girls returned to Virginia for the start of the school year. Rather than following the first judges lead, and formalizing the couples parentage rights on Jacobs birth certificate, Knutson insisted on full-bore legal proceedings. Instead of conducting informal interviews with Timmons, Olson, the surrogate, her husband, and officials from the surrogacy agency, Knutson required them all to testify at formal depositions. And while many surrogacy cases in Wisconsin do not involve an independent legal guardian, and those that do usually have fees of less than $1,500, Knutsons bills topped $100,000 to be paid by Timmons and Olson. In November, Knutson filed a 45-page report to Judge Troupis, calling for more court oversight of surrogacy cases and arguing that rubber-stamping a gestational surrogacy contract made by two men with no genetic connection to the child would open the way to a dangerous expansion of the concept of parenthood. Such surrogacy contracts, his report said, broker pregnancy, commodify children, and meet the needs of wealthy intended parents at the expense of the children involved. And, he warned, they stretch the boundaries of parenthood beyond all recognition, almost to the point of creating a world, like the one in Platos Republic, in which all children would be raised communally, with no special connection to their parents. Platos assertion that no child should know its parent, once anathema to American jurisprudence, is not so different from paying for parental rights in this case, Knutson wrote. View this image  Rick Olson holding his son, Jacob. David Bohrer In his March decision, Judge Troupis seemed to rely on many of Knutsons arguments. He terminated the surrogates maternal rights and gave the Virginia men only temporary custody, technically leaving Jacob an orphan. Knutson declined to comment for BuzzFeed News, and Judge Troupis could not be reached through his law office. As news of the case spread, LGBT rights advocates were horrified. This case is an indication of the work thats left to be done, said Emily Hecht-McGowan, director of public policy at the Family Equality Council, an advocacy group that supported Timmons and Olson. Theres a sense in the gay community and among parents at large that now that we have marriage equality, all the issues are resolved, and same-sex couples will be treated like everyone else, but thats not yet true. The Troupis decision left Timmons and Olson at a crossroads: They could continue to appeal in Wisconsin, or take a different route, pursuing an adoption in their home state of Virginia. While they weighed these options from their home in Virginia while caring for Jacob and their young daughters they had a lucky break: Judge Troupis resigned May 2, to try, unsuccessfully, for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Timmons and Olson had already moved to reopen and reconsider Judge Troupiss ruling, but with the judges resignation, their case was transferred to yet another judge, Peter Anderson, who overturned Judge Troupiss faulty opinion, which he criticized for using language that was unduly harsh and kind of weird. Since their victory, Timmons and Olson have spent the summer fighting Knutsons huge legal bills, and going public with their story to try to prevent similar actions by rogue judges elsewhere. Our biggest concern is that you had a judge ignoring the law, ignoring precedent, with intention to take Jacob away, or to torture us, based on his personal opinion, Timmons said. Were using our voices to try to make sure this never happens to another family. CORRECTION Judge Troupis appointed as the childs legal guardian Mark Knutson, who in turn brought in another lawyer from his firm, Erik Krueger. An earlier version of this story swapped the two mens first names.

aS"The man in Sydney has been charged with administering poison intending to cause injury, distress, or pain. View this image  Ryan Mcvay / Getty Images A man in Australia has been charged after he allegedly tried to put a dangerously corrosive acid in a dispenser at a gay bathhouse on Saturday. The 62-year-old man was arrested at a business in Rydalmere in Sydneys west, New South Wales police said in a statement Sunday. Authorities did not name the club, but the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reported the incident occurred at the Aarows bathhouse, which is described on its website as a secure, relaxed environment where gay and bi people can meet and socialize together 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. View this image  Erikamitchell / Getty Images The man allegedly tried to place hydrochloric acid, a highly corrosive chemical that can cause severe burns to skin, inside one of the lube dispensers scattered around the sex club. Following previous similar incidents at the club, dispensers were fitted with alarms to alert security officers when tampered with, police said. Police will allege an alarm sounded and security detained the man before police [arrived], officers said. No serious injuries were reported. The man was charged with administering poison intending to injure/cause distress/pain, entering a building with intent to commit an indictable offense, malicious damage, and driving with a suspended license. A man who answered the Aarows phone early Monday morning Sydney time told BuzzFeed News he did not wish to comment. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"It is the first time the National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce has endorsed in a presidential race. View this image  AP / Carolyn Kaster The largest LGBT business association in the United States voted this week to endorse a presidential candidate for the first time in its history choosing Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump.The LGBT community has come too far to lose its seat at the table, Chance Mitchell, the National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerces co-founder and CEO, said in a statement to BuzzFeed News.Several LGBT groups have shown an affinity for Clinton, including the Human Rights Campaign, which endorsed her in January. However, Fridays endorsement from the 15-year-old business group comes amid and despite Trumps pronounced recent overtures to LGBT voters. Trump has proposed that his hardline policies on immigration would protect LGBT communities from terrorism. And he has long charged that he is a better candidate for American business.In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Clinton welcomed the endorsement and took a swing at her opponent.The stakes in this election could not be higher for LGBT Americans, Clinton said. When Donald Trump says hell make America great again, thats code for take America backwards. He has said he would appoint judges who would overturn marriage equality.The board of the LGBT chamber of commerce which represents roughly 1.4 million LGBT business owners and has about 150 corporate and government partners approved its resolution unanimously at a conference this week in Palm Springs, California. In its resolution, the group praised Clinton for denouncing LGBT discrimination as not only morally wrong, but fundamentally destructive for business. The resolution rejected Trumps policies, saying he has vowed to revoke LGBT inclusive executive orders on his first day in office.Clinton added that Mike Pence, the Indiana governor running for vice president with Trump, signed a law to protect private businesses that cite their faith when deciding to provide, or withhold, services. (Pence later signed a law that said the previous law could not be used to discriminate.) Clinton also cited an anti-LGBT law passed this year in North Carolina, saying it has caused companies to pull jobs and millions of dollars out of the state. Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

aS"We must avoid having a segregated system. View this image  Charles Mcquillan / Getty Images The Sunday Telegraph reported that the draft question under consideration by the government is, Do you approve of a law to permit people of the same sex to marry? The former Democrat senator told BuzzFeed News there are problems with the phrasing. It suggests the government is not looking to include people in the existing act, it is looking to add an act, he said. We must avoid having a segregated system of parallel marriages, one for straight people and one for non-straight people. Dean of the UNSW Faculty of Law George Williams told BuzzFeed News it would be entirely possible to have a separate law allowing same-sex marriages. There would need to be amendments to the existing Marriage Act, because otherwise it would give rise to inconsistency, he said. If you cleared out those inconsistencies, you could still have separate legislation providing for same-sex marriage. A spokesperson for attorney-general George Brandis did not rule out the possibility. The mechanics of the plebiscite are subject to the usual cabinet processes and no decision has been made, the spokesperson said. However, Williams said he cant see any point to such a proposal. Of course, it might send an unfortunate signal about whether same-sex marriage is on par with other forms of marriage, he said. View this image  Lisa Maree Williams / Getty Images Greig and other advocates have also expressed concern that the draft question does not include all people with the wording same sex. GetUp! campaigner Sally Rugg said the draft question excludes intersex people and people without a binary gender identity through the prescriptive wording same-sex marriage. Williams echoed these concerns, saying the best way to legislate for marriage equality would be not include the words same sex at all. The best way would be to amend the definition of marriage, in the Marriage Act, to make it clear it applies not just to heterosexual couples but marriage generally between two people.
